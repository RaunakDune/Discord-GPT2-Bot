"Whoa, that filled fast, Thanks all! 😄"

Just do an @ pc and that should do it. But do it in general

"@PC Anybody interested in doing a raid tonight? Current team of 4, looking for 2 more"
No experience necessary
What time?
"In about 10, 15 minutes?"
i'd hop in on that. i've never touched eow or sos
sweet
we're 6 then
ill inv when we're good to go
@PC anyone wana knock out a quick nightfall?
I'm game
what's your btag?
Masrim#1810
added - i'm shooshi16
Accepted
"I'm also good for a nightfall. TRex1780#1766 *edit: Just realized I'm a half hour late to this. Nvm, haha"
i can do another one
"I just hopped into wrapping up side missions I wanted to get rid of. Appreciate it, but maybe another time"
Np anytime
Anyone want to do a quick NF run?
anyone for nightfall?
anyone up for a nightfall?
Is anybody interested in doing SOS either tonight or tomorrow?
"no experience is required or anything, just lmk if interested"
"I'd be interested in tonight depending on timing. You can put me as a maybe, I guess?"
Aww yiss
haha gotcha @TRex1780
What's the power level recommended?
I believe the recommended is 370
"btw, what time works well fo ryou @TRex1780 ?"
What time are you thinking?
"Oof. I didn't realize light level had to be 370, I only 348 right now. Maybe I should hold off for the time being"
ah ok I think that would be wise
sorry @TRex1780 !
also i'm good anytime after 5 @Arixama
"Nope, that's on me! Gotta get to grinding those weekly milestones"
yeah haha... that weekly grind
Any idea about how long it would run?
"lmk if you need help with any of them @TRex1780 , and running normal leviathan + EOW are also fast ways to get your light up"
"@Arixama it's hard to guess for now, I would say it depends on our group"
we should be able to get to the boss fight I think
however the boss may take a while
really just depends on communication and teamwork !
"I'm not sure exactly when I'll be home, but I'd definitely be down to try it."
"alright sweet, sounds good"
i'll let u know of any updates
I work tonight but I'm home around 9:30 EST. 368 PL so I might not be all that useful
That being said I am interested
ooh sweet okay
"368 isn't too bad, the ads will be a bit more dangerous but i think we should give it a shot"
I'll probably be on around 530 cst or so
i think thats 6:30 est
I can do any time tonight.  My wife aggro is at an all time low
lool awesome!
haha
Anytime want to do a quick nf
"Yo @Masrim I'm down. I'm level 354 though, is that ok?"
I just hooked up with arixama and CNC. But I need to get 2 done so if you are around after
Heck yeah
anybody want to run the arms dealer acrius quest with @TheCnC and me?
Ron and I are looking for 1 more to do nf
Yup
Let's try this haha
do u guys need anohter?
i can join for nf
yeah!
Sure
alright give me a sec
Was just going to pick up a random otherwise
Trissin is u I guess
yep haha
That was great!
good run
Woohoo
Ok my NF are all done. Anyone need a body for anything
@Masrim should I invite you in?
@PC so who's running spire tonight?
Sure. And I can but have never done that so understand if that is no good
nono its all good!
i dont mind teaching it
we can help ron with his quest first tho
im max 375 id be up for it
Yeah hope it's short!
"I'm max 366,  a little low but I would do my absolute best"
I think we can try it out!
ads will be kinda tough
but we should definitely give it a try'
Max 368. If I get a few drops I might be able to bring it up to 370
That being said I'm interested
sweet!
"so we're 5 then, is that correct?"
sounds like it
Logging in now
looks like we need one more for spire @PC
380 is required right?
recommended is 370
i think 365+ should be ok'
Oh okay
ads might be a bit tough
but it should be alright
I'm 378
oh yeah thats fine
And ive never run it before though
no worries!
no exp required at all
"ok cool I'll com,e then"
we using voice chat?
"yes, we will be starting soon"
sorry im just in a strike rn
thats chill.
all good
That was so good. I'm starting to like this game! /s
ive got the full levi set with all the mods lol
"ayyy, nice!!"
alright I am in the voice channel
go ahead and join up on trissin!
will be in in a few
"Was thinking about the run last night, we should try the arcstrider strat since we already have so many hunters"
"Everybody just needs a Raiden Flux, and during dmg phase we just slam his feet"
i could also pop in as my hunter
haha that would make 6 arcstriders!
I think it's worth a shot
That could work. Maybe 1 Titan with melting point
Definitely could. Gonna do a run of EoW today and maybe regular Leviathan just to get the Power Level increases and not be a potato when it comes to the enemies
Lol I never did a raid before so I thought last night was the regular one
"Really? You did well then last night. Spire of Stars is the second raid lair that was released for D2. Leviathan is the base raid, Eater of Worlds is the other raid lair."
Eater of Worlds is my preferred raid just because it's a good balance between length and challenge. I find it to be the most fun.
@Trissin did you guys finish Spire? first time we cleared we did 5 arcstriders + 1 melting point. second and third time we had 3 arcstriders + 3 coils w/ Luna rifts. proved to be very clean two phases.
"We didn't finish Spire. I had to go last night, was past 1 AM my time lol. We're gonna give it another go sometime soon"
oh okay aha. well for your first clear I would definitely recommend 5 or all arcstriders.
were you guys sending one person up to destroy the ships or were you sending two? we only send one and it makes things massively easier.
"We would send 2. It was working out fine imo, just we had trouble killing the gladiators and that was what wasted the most time for us"
Yeah we might need to equip some rocket launchers
if your arcstriders have shotguns (EP shotty or Zenith are best) those will take them down very quick. or jump back and use a coil shot. one coil and then some primary shots take care of them nicely.
only rocket launcher you would need is coil😜
Wardcliff?
I got that at 378 or 379 so I'm good to go haha
I just need a better helmet. Hoping I can snag one from Leviathan or EoW
I need to learn to jump better lol
yeah wardcliff is all you need for the boss aha. does crazy damage and will take the gladiators down very quick.
We doing SoS again today?
"I'd like to, depends on everybody else"
okay lol i can go for a bit
I won't be on until around 530
you wanna come to one i joined?
You need anything body?
Another not anything lol
I'd like to do it again. Hit 371 so I'm not a potato anymore with gear.
"Any chance anyone would be interested in a leviathan or EoW run tomorrow morning? Still a bit new with both, but wanting to get them down better."
Anyone want to do some Valor grinding (QP/Mayhem) for MoT?
How hard is the rat kings crew quest? Has everyone here completed it?
"pretty easy, you just need people to do it with"
the toughest part is doing the nightfall
"Hmm, if anyone has  the time, it'd be cool to finish it"
oh actually I still need to finish that as well
I haven't yet. Would be willing to grind it with you
"i believe you can only do it with people who either have the rat king, or they are on the same step of the quest"
"Ohh, so first some patrols"
for me
then public events then crucible then nightfall
seems like it
i dont actually remember tho
I cheated and googled it
lol
I was going around the edz and trying to shoot rats
I'm at the part where you have to do strikes with clan mates
that's apparently the last step
if you guys need somebody to help you all get on the same step i can hop in quick
do we have to be on the same level? not sure
oh yeah that'd be awesome
Then get to work haha
i'm online
that was awkward
@Trissin did you need to get to a certain step?
nono im good thanks!
one more public event for me
Sorry. I'm out walking the dog right now lol.  Will be on later
"so my friends and I are running through EOW, one person is new and has never done it before"
we need one more
_(warning: really cancerous group)_
_(**really** cancerous)_
@PC
Cancerous?
yes
How so lol
i dont know how to explain it
with words
Like...will I get cancer if I join this group?
probably
it's loud and very chaotic
Are they going to shit on you if you make a mistake haha
jokingly
"Like normal asshole cancerous or elitist ""we know everything you're terribad GTFO"" cancerous?"
^
nah they're not really assholes they just fuck around a lot
eow should be quick but it will probably take a bit longer
because of
chaos
also the conversation goes to some
very interesting places
they're not assholes but they do fool around
anybody interested? lol
I want to but I need to wait a little to play.  Just got back from walk and wife is looking at me the way vandals who are just out of range of you watch you
lmaooo
how long?
Like 30 minutes at least
She should go to bed by then haha
The third step in rats king is the crucible right?
ah... we were planning on starting a bit earlier @Masrim
sorry!!!!
No worries. I was going to do some rat King of red is still on when I am
Is anybody good at trials?
I am terrible
but i wanna get better
"I just got access to them, so you can guess..."
i havent played since release
Oh @Arixama I figured out why I couldnt complete rat kings
Apparantly we either have to be on the same quest step or one of us has to equip the rat kings weapon
which step are you on now
The crucible one
#3
thats kind of what i figured after the second match not giving it to you
Mayhem Valor grinding anyone?
Yo anyone up for some heroic mars missions? I having a heck of a time completing the nascent dawn 2 quest. Keep dying at the very last stage.
"lets go knock it out, let me log on"
yay!
estimated wait time to log in (after they kicked me out) is 76 minutes?!?!?
???
blizzard says its a busy day
"sunday at 11:30pm est, real busy time  lol"
I think it's the free weekend
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
how does that affect it?
Trillions of people logging in
"down to 9 minutes now, was a quick 76 minutes lol"
but why did they kick me out
I think when you moved zones they couldn't find an empty server to slot you in
"See:
https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/06/how-destiny-2-works/"
"it said I had to restart and update blizzard, I was going to a lost secor"
so there is only ever 8 other people playing with you?
"Yup, plus your fireteam"
never noticed that before
"ALso that's why during the escalation events in Mars, all other enemies in the maps almost disappear"
that is a pretty good read
explains why wacking shit happens in strikes sometimes
Rockpapershotgun's The MEchanic series of articles is fascinating
Yup yup
Back to grinding this Lance
Good luck
No luck needed. Just boredom and thralls
anybody want to help me run through the acrius arms dealer strike?
Sure. Give me 2 minutes
"I'm light level 357, is that too low?"
recommended is 300
Oh I'm on my way then
I'm ready when you want
basically a nightfall with solar singe and equipment locked
got booted again saying I have to restart destiny
"OK, finally got all 3 levels on each character, taking a break until tomorrow unless someone wants to do leviathon or something (never done it yet)"
nice!! I wouldn't mind running/teaching leviathan whenever people would like
"I'm at 349 light and need to raid more often to get through this grind, so I'd be interested in leviathan or EoW as long as life schedule lines up"
"yeah! I'd love to help, just lmk when!"
I'd be down to run leviathan again. I gotta get them acrius seals.
"I'm generally around this whole week from 5 PM EST on except for Tuesday, not sure what everyone else's availability is like"
Heck yeah I'm down for leviathan as a noobie
Evenings are best
"looks like we got 5 already, sweet"
does later tonight work (~9:30ish EST) @Masrim @TRex1780 @Arixama @RonInDune
I started the raid once alone died 10 times before realizing I'm an idiot. It should go a lot better this time round.
lol!
yeah haha
That is perfect for me.
let's see if we can get 1 more too
That works for me. I generally don't work Monday to Wednesday so I can be up til whenever
"I actually probably can't start that late, work trainings this week means I'm trying to get to bed a little earlier than the usual. I'll get on other runs though, don't wait for me if you can get 6"
noo trex! what if we started a bit earlier then?
"we could try starting between 5-7, whenever works for most people"
I cant make that today but if you guys get 6 you should go for it!
"I'll be off work roughly 2 1/2 hours from now, so anytime after that"
"I'd say 730 is probably as late as I can start, maybe 8 if I want to hate myself the next day"
I'm available at 7:30 EST
730 works for me
"i have a question, for that last raid we went on, how are people supposed to figure all that crap out?"
"So we definitely have me, @RonInDune , and @Masrim. Anyone else available 730 EST?  (10 mins from now) I have a firend outside the clan who might be able to fill a spot if needed"
How bout @Trissin ?
If lizard cannot make it do we have anyone that knows what to do?
He said he cannot make it until 9ish I think
Oh dang
"I've run a few times, I can talk us through gauntlet, baths, and calus. Dogs could be troublesome, and I don't know the underbelly well enough to use it"
How good is the official destiny website LFG?
"Never tried it, honestly"
I've run leviathan a few times as well
Dogs is always troublesome if you don't have someone who knows where to go well
"That's exactly it for me, I don't know the dogs paths or their damage phase locations that great"
"I don't know about everyone else, but if availability works better, we could always try this later in the week"
"That's cool with me, I'm free all nights"
How hard is Trials of the Nine?
"Basically depends on who you get matched against, but generally pretty hard"
Ah well
"So I think we're in agreement on holding on the raid. If that's the case, now I have no excuse to not go on my run for the day 😑"
Good luck running! I swam for an hour and am beat
"Shoot, that's a ton of swimming! Haha, thanks bud"
anyone doing anything?  im bored grinding catalysts
Most any other evening I would be down for leviathan
"Hey guys, im trying to run a friend through the raid with a couple of other friends. Anyone wanna do it? We need 2 more."
Just leviathan normal
sure
You got a time frame?
I could hop on but I just ordered a pizza
"Uh we're goin as soon as possible so if you wanna join and just take a break when your pizza comes, that's cool"
sounds good to me
"I think you can join on me.  We're in another discord, I can invite you"
"oh noooo im so sorry guys, yeah I was busy earlier tonight"
dynamite in game?
Yep
I should change my nickname
"are we good to start at 7:30 EST tomorrow? (and also I think we are looking for one more!)
@Arixama @Masrim @TRex1780 @RonInDune"
Yup Yup
@TheCnC said that he'd probably be good to do one
sweet sweet
I can''t waot
*wait
"@Trissin and whoever else, if you guys need one more ill probably be on and would be down to do the raid"
anybody free to quickly help me out with prestige nightfall
haven't found a way to solo the boss....at least not on warlock
(im on the boss)
"I'm a warlock at lvl 357, I can join in"
tyty
coming hang on
much appreciated
take your time
btw the modifier is void singe
Aww crap
"haha we got it, ty ron!"
That was quite fun actually
Hard as balls though
@Trissin I'm good for tonight at 730
"awesome, just gotta see if @Arixama @TRex1780 and @Masrim are good with that time"
I should be as well
great!
Definitely good
I WILL give it one more go  haha
what
"wife aggro is getting high though,  essentially I got spotted by a dog and the hounds are about to start howling"
😮
"haha, just because I have been on here late 3 nights in a row, until 1 or 2am"
is perfect paradox a good shotgun?
**yes**
"in my personal opinion, i'd put it in the top 3"
behind only the EP shotgun and tractor cannon
but tractor is not good for leviathon right?\
_well_
that's a bit of a loaded question
i would say it depends on strategy
some of the more off-meta strategies use tractor cannon a lot
if you are doing void everywhere it is good
yeah exactly
one strat a lot of people dont know is that the tractor cannon actually works on lanterns in the baths
That would speed things up tremendously
"yeah, a voidwalker running top tree can tractor cannon a full set of 3 lanterns and nova bomb it"
immediately destroying a full set
faster than sunbreaker too
"also, voidwalker running scatter grenade can literally _delete_ a dog in the gardens"
"tractor cannon, and then scatter grenade its feet"
That is good to know
"yeah, i got this all from a video by indica"
let me link it
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz6stgQ2QmU
Cool I should watch those today.  I start a new job next week so won't have as much time haha
ahh gotcha
raids might have to be a weekend only thing for me
in the future
Might have to try to get some EP parties going to get that shotgun
Is the basilisk any good?
"@Trissin Turns out I may be a little late to raid time, I may have to pick up someone at 7 and quick drop them off.  Latest I should be would 15-20 minutes late."
That's it. You have to bring pizza for everyone
🍕
I'll email it to you
Man I haven't had pizza in so long. It's been almost 12 hours.
i just got a 50% off coupon from dominoes  yay!  bad thing is there is not one in delivery range to me  😦
Who wants to try a prestige nf with heavy and arc singe
Are there any plans to do prestige raid lairs next week?
What kind of light levels do they need?
I don't think they've announced that unless I just missed it
Most likely 385 since SOS is 370
Would sweet business or wardcliff be better for leviathan tonight?
my gut says the biz would be better for inside to rack up the skull count
"not sure myself, never made it to the skull section."
anyone on here use windows 7?
I have a bunch of Win 7 VMs running
through 10?
"I think sweet business is good for skulls, but wardcliff has a lot of uses in any damage phase throughout the raid"
that's what I thought.  empowering rift with sweet biz at the end seems like a guaranteed 1 phase lol
"Could be! I might be misremembering, but I think if you had prometheus lens, every skull pop counted as a kill, so it put more ammo in the clip, and that was ludicrously good. Definitely doesn't work that way now though"
I used coldheart last time I did this raid with the rift and it wrecked skulls pretty well so I can only assume biz will be that much better
Crimson should do well
sorry I'm a bit late! just give me a few minutes
no problem
I was even on time!
No worries!
Pizza isn't on me tonight!
We've been waiting for hours
For voidlock should I go top or bottom
may want to switch it up during the raid
we'll see
is @RonInDune here?
Yessir
okay great!
Dunno if my loadout is potimal
ah it's fine
go ahead and join up on me in orbit @Arixama @RonInDune @Masrim @TRex1780 @TheCnC
oh wait
im gettign error code weasel
every body want to join on me then?
raid alpha right?
Uh I got disconnected
What the heck happened
I got booted to desktop
uh oh
I'm coming back
@RonInDune can u join the voice chat in discord?
Uh hang on
Thanks for a great raid guys. It was freaking awesome.
"ofc! glad you enjoyed it, I had a great time as well"
"if anybody is interested in doing levi, eow, sos, or even prestige levi can just lmk and I would love to join in!"
dont mind teaching it either
Wish I could have joined in! Sadly had work. Glad to hear that you guys had a good time
I'm always down for a good raid
"@Oathbreaker if you wanna do one some time this week, lmk id be down"
oh hey @Sabre ! sorry we didn't have space for you tonight!!!
all good! haha another time
"thanks again lizard for guiding.. and all others who helped teach, I think I'm an expert now  😉"
"I'll be looking to do some tomorrow for sure. Maybe Friday night after 1pm est once I get off work, and again for sure on Sunday night (5pm est) and monday at any time"
yeah! glad our clan is finally becoming a bit more active haha
You guys are indeed pretty nice
yeah me too. it wasnt super active even just a couple weeks ago.
"I am actually going out of town for a while starting tomorrow, and I wont be back for a while unfortunately"
Always glad to have a group of people to run things with. Maybe we can get some EP going sometime soon!
but in that time I think you guys should give eow a shot
yeah!! ep for sure
Try guiding us via smoke signals
LOL
hahaha
"I'm familiar with EoW so yeah, you know what, I could try leading that maybe"
that sounds awesome!
"definitely ep, I want that shotty!!!"
"THat'd be great! I just started a second character, so all this extra gear will help."
ive run eow once
having 3 chars really speeds up the LL grind
Last time I led a raid it was D1 lol. Sherpa'd a group going through Wrath of the Machine
they have to be different classes though
oh FUN @Oathbreaker
i loved wrath
"Yeah I just started the hunter, already got one 361 warlock"
Vault of Glass was easily my favorite to sherpa
_areyoukidding_ vog was the worstt
NOOOOO
KINGS FALL
BY MILES
nah
crotas end was actually the worst
SO MANY LITTLE TECHNICAL ERRORS WOULD KILL A RUN
but just
atheon
my first fclear of atheon took
centuries
I count the Y1 version of Crota as a strike so...
Atheon was a coordination check in the best of ways
It wasn't a hard check
Y1 level 26s could clear it with enough patience
Get up to like 28 with the old system and that's when it got easy
Templar was fun and was challenging to a degree
"King's Fall was fun for sure, but trying to sherpa it was beyond brutal. It forced perfection in the later fights. Warpriest you could make errors and still win. Golgoroth you could make errors but still get the DPS to beat him. Deathsingers was where you hoped you didn't have a Warlock get runner and if you did you wiped. It was also really hard to have to try and coordinate. And then Oryx, good lord Oryx. 20 minutes of mechanic based actions where you only do damage to the boss himself is right at the end. You just had to hope your team could hold it together until the end or you waste a whole bunch of time"
oh my god thats a large paragraph
hahahah
I have my dislikes about King's Fall lmfao
Wrath took the best parts of all the raids and molded them together IMO
actually I believe someone in here _loved_  running as a warlock in KF
I mean some Warlock mains did really well
Just in my experience with PUGs the Warlocks tended to be alt characters
ah haha
you know
this clan was almost gonna be called shoot the shooties right @thegoaliebear
Oh boy do I ever.
i still think it should be shoot the shooties
but yknow
thats me
ive only ever run vog and crota
@Trissin we do not speak of that.
"Ari, you on Xbox?"
For D1?
no ps4
Damn. Was gonna offer a few runs of the other raids
"i'd love to get back into destiny 1 and run through KF and wrath, absolutely"
i was on ps4 as well
i;ve got it insatalled
not that excited about vog or crota haha
got a lock and a titan at 400
Vog I just had way too many good memories of
ooooh nice
ew i have so many bad memories of vog
and a level 9 hunter!
Sure it's got its faults that other raids improve upon
But I found that it was the one I just kept coming back to
i thought crotas end was just.. idk
too simple?
Time and time again
Again
it was a strike in Y1
I solo'd that shit once
lmaooooo
If you can solo a raid
You're doing something wrong
@ solo aksis
Unless you're Gladd or Slayerage
lolol was about to say
Okay actually Solo Aksis is really demanding
I still want to try it actually
im not sure i want to try that
I don't even know if it's possible anymore
Key strategies might have been nerfed
🤔
who knows
I'll look into it lol. If I'm feeling particularly insane one night I'll see what I need to do
hahahha
also didnt gladd solo oryx?
i havent even seen that one yet
still have no idea
Solo Oryx is no longer possibel
Possible*
oh what???
Used the Sleeper before it's nerf at the start of ROI
well now im really curious
"It was a pseudo-nerf, purely because they changed its interaction with Oryx's chest"
So unless you were a GG with Nighthawk somehow getting enough super energy to get 4 supers off the solo isn't possible iirc
ahhh
I HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRON
WRONG*
Esoterickk did it with Touch of Malice after the SS change
"yeah im watching gladd rn, he's using touch as well"
and its definitely after roi because he also does aksis later in the video
Yeah that was the one he does all possible ones back to back to back right?
yep!!
That was beyond insane
gladd isn't human
No
Not at all
And he's about to 2 man EOW wtf
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
just gladd things
makes you wonder what 3rd party assists he is using
"if anyones up for a NF hit me up, can even do prestige (likely with heavy and arc singe)"
im down for a nf
Let's make it happen.  I'm just going Flash point atm
"kk, logging on now"
if anybody else wants in they're free to join
on my way in
might be slightly garbage
go ahead and join up on us
just doing normal for now
I love heavy day
Killed Zahn before we got half way up the elevator
I wish there were tabs in the vault
I wish there was any sort of logical organization in the vault.
True
I put all my legendary mods and shaders in there and there will be like a line of mods and then some weapons and then more mods
But you can sort by newest
Oh I've looked at all the sorting types and they don't seem to make sense for the mods as far as I can tell
They don't. All useless
going do some normal rifts for powerful engrams if anyone wants to help me
strikes
How do you get powerful from normal strikes?
mildstone
Ahh the heroics. They are easy today. Solar and heavy
no normals
i got to do 2 normals
For a powerful Engram?
wait it not powerful just a leg
my b
Heroics should count
For those don't they?
we can try it yea want to
it says mildstone under normal strikes
I'm not at home yet. Walking the dog
Usually that is the minimum
I think
no idea
But you need to do 3 heroics any way
yea
i just swaped from ps4 to pc on sunday
so it's probably the nightfall unlock milestone
Sounds like it
yes it is
every time i try to get randoms it puts me in there solo
That's people abondoning because they don't like the strike
and why are my wait time so dang long on everything takes like 10 mins to just get in a crucible match
I've got a guy who's looking to join the clan. Am I good to just send him the links and stuff and he joins up or does someone specific need to do that?
Did you tell him about the secret blood ritual already?
"Not just yet, don't want to scare him away just yet"
anyone still need to do the nightfall?
I do!
Awesome.  Just getting logged in now
"Me too, hang on"
I do. But won't be on until tomorrow evening. Golf day tomorrow
"Thanks for a great one, you guys rule"
iron banner anyone?
Anyone know the Nessus hvt that spawns with a Minotaur guard
And the cabal inside a cage
Well it spawned on top of me and I'm stuck in the cage with that thing lol
lmfaoo thats amazing
Damn @Masrim  that's a one in a million event. You should buy a lottery ticket today.
You could do it on purpose by just waiting there likely
"I tried that once, didn't happen, I got pushed to the right"
I took a screen shot and a pic with my phone haha
"Post it on reddit or something. Or ask Bungie for a refund, broken game."
I got the game free with my video card lol. Spent 25 on the expansions though
I should have took a pic when it was alive. But that guy hits hard
Honestly surprised I survived
"Any chance folks might be available for a lev or EoW run tomorrow afternoon? Got a buddy who's never run a raid before, want to take him through one or the other"
"yeah ive done lev a few times, id be down"
I can do one
Anyone feel like playing Trials? I havent done it yet
What's trials?
"trials of the nine, its the weekend PvP playlist. if you win matches in a set, you get rewards but if you lose 3 your win count resets"
Ahh
@TRex1780 what time are you thinking?
"Didn't have any solid time in particular. As long as it's afternoon EST, my friend and I should be alright"
"coolio, i should be in"
"So @Arixama, @TRex1780, @Masrim, Trex's Friend, and me. Just need one more"
"Hey all - its a bit last minute but I have a couple hours before I have to travel, anyone looking to do any EP?"
"For the raid group today, does 230 est work for everyone?"
"I can go then, if you still need 1 more"
"That'd be awesome @NickyDynamite ! @Sabre , @Arixama , @Masrim , is 230 est ok for you all?"
works for me
Same
yeah 2:30 works for me
sounds like we have a group then. sick
"got an hour to kill, anyone want to do NF?"
im down. let me log in
Excellent. Want to make it prestige with arc and heavy
i mean im only like 355 or something so idk what the light level is for prestige
360 :(
No worries we can do normal. Prestige is just easier lol

Ok
oh it says your destination is too full so just send one and lmk when to join. im gonna head to the tower real quick

I'm at the tower. Probably why it is full
"Heads up for raid group, my buddy is running a touch behind. Might be 245 instead"
Does he know the pizza rule
"Since he lives so close to me, I'm gonna make sure he knows, haha"
Woot!  Just decided to go to Mercury to turn in some tokens and first one is perfect paradox
"@Arixama , still good for the raid?"
"yup, just gotta grab a drink first"
"Ok, no worries! 👍"
This is me trapped inside that shield on Nessus

I'm currently waiting for the event to spawn. I've already attempted once.
Oh dang I might join you tomorrow
"The unfortunate part is that there's currently no real walkthrough, so I'm trying to figure out which ways to go."
"That's pretty fun, right?  I imagine it's like figuring out the raids..."
"Definitely, but without having to get a bunch of people together."
Yo anyone want to try to do the new event?

Can it be done in like 4 minutes?
Or gonna take a little longer?
Another minute or so
150 MB remaining
"You're in, 100%. What LL are you out of curiosity?"
Around 365
Perfect! You'll be able to deal damage but it may be a little rough for you in the final room
I've already got Whisper so that should help in some regards
I'll do my best! What's the recommended gear?
Highest light
Anyone wanting to do whisper? Got myself up to 372 light so hopefully thats enought to contend
wanyone wanna grind renown with me on titan
"Anyone who would like to do the Whisper mission, please add me on Discord and I would be more than happy to help you through the mission. I already have the weapon but I would be more than happy to help you through the mission!"
"Hey @Oathbreaker  - I'd love to take a shot at it but I'm also  only around 365 light. I can go melting point titan tho, which may help?"
@Aberration We'll take you through for sure!
@Oathbreaker  when ever you have time
"@xspartinx We'll run you through as well. I believe the order is Sabre, you, then Aberration. I'm just doing a few things on my end and I should be logging in around an hour from now."
i was next last night lmao all good
jk thanks a ton
I have to go do errands and such as I was traveling all this last week - I'll see if I can get on at a time that works for us all! Obviously don't wait for me but I hope it lines up 😃
We'll see Aberration! If the mission is around in the coming weeks I'll make sure I get to you at some point soon.
Back now
Okay! We still need to run Sabre and Spartan but you're on the list.
"Cool cool, ill be grinding out some milestones, have to catch up from the week ahha"

"Hey all!! Been away from home without access to discord, finally have some internet nkw :))"
"Seems like I've missed a LOT in d2, like prestige raid lairs and my old friend BLACK SPINDLE"
I'm super glad that our clan is more active now !
Spindle anomaly stops being available in 12 hours and opens again sometime next week
"Ahhh welp thats ok, I only get home next week anyway"
VERY excited to run through it though
as well as finish prestige raid lairs
"It's real good. Unless you want to go in blind, I'd recommend watching some videos of at sleast the jumping puzzle."
"yeah aha, I've heard the jumping puzzle is pretty troll"
I feel like I've missed so much haha
"It only got discover on Friday, so at least it wasn't too much."
"that's fair, but there is 400 light stuff now!!"
"And also a bunch of new catalysts, armor reworks, BOUNTIES"
So much to do lol
"if anybody is free sometime next week and willing to help me run thru the black spindle event, lmk!!"
I'd also love to get a group going at the prestige raids
@Oathbreaker and I have been running most people through it.
"bounties are ok, but only tied to crucible and strikes."
when do you get back?
I'm back on July 30th
A week from now
"I heard it's similar to the mission from d1, but tbh I didn't find it too bad!"
(in d1)
from what i've heard its a little bit easier cause the last room is more open
ohhhhhh okay cool!
"last room is 380, but oath and i have been getting 365's through it in one shot now. we got this."
haha yeah that should be ok!
I'm so excited
"i dont know if the ornaments will still be available or not, but theres currently 2 in eververse bundles."
I've also been reading there are a lot of secrets in the quest afterwards?? Like the ship
"ah that's fine, I like the taken effect"
"yeah, once you complete the normal you get a heroic mission on the map"
"that drops the catalyst, and theres hidden chests and secret stuff that gets you a ship schematic and progress on bot it's catalyst and the sleeper one i believe"
ooh sounds cool
have you seen the bosses?
"I have not, no"
I heard it's the same guy from d1 lol
Uzrok??
Not sure
urzok i think
bullet sponge knight
Weird hive names
oh haha
those are the best kinds of bosses
also valus ta'aurc and a fallen baron(?) from house of wolves
"damnnnn, more stuff from HoW!"
"baroness, once of the bounties"
haha sounds awesome
"well I gotta head out for now, but I'm v excited for all this when I'm back"
Thanks Ari!
"Sorry, was asleep when this convo was going on! Lizard, if you see me online next week whisper me and if I have some time I'll take you through the mission for sure."
"yo! Ty so much oathbreaker

_(totally see what you did there... **whisper** you haha)_"
I'll show myself out
LMAO. Totally unintended. You missed all the cabal memes and messages I was sending in game to the clan chat to keep people updated. Came to a total of like 6 people we helped over the weekend. Was fun but I don't think I could do that mission for a while 😂
lool damn i was looking forward to some more memes
and Jesus that is a lot of runs
"It'll be okay though haha, I've got a friend who wants the spindle as well and hes high enough light for the mission"
"Yeah, I sent the Rockets McDickFace strike intro, the Psion Flayers intro, and one other off the top of my head. Was a long 7 hour night for Ari and I hahaha"

I'm not sure if I'll be able to. Most weeks I'm pretty booked up on week days...more of a weekend warrior. I'll check it out later ya never know. What time are you going to try?
"we were planning to start around 8 ish, but we're very flexible"
we can push the time around
what time works for you?
"or if you can't run it tonight, that's totally fine too"
I'm going out on a limb and just going to guess I'll likely not be able to. It's a bummer I miss out most weeks since my available time table is kind of garbage
Like..it's early morning weekdays and before noon on weekends as best time
ouch those arent very popular times haha
well dont worry about it
"i'll definitely run it with ya some other time, when youre free"
Sure sure. Wife is out of town this Thursday til next Weds so I have much more available time
@Trissin if you need someone to do leviathan I should be available whenever. I need to get me the calus challenge emblem anyway.
okay @Arixama tyty! we've actually decided to push it to tomorrow since it turns out a couple people couldnt make today
"that being said, if we have a spot tomorrow night ill be sure to let u know"
"meanwhile i am interested in running some more raids in this clan, such as the raid lairs or the prestige raids"
i believe there were some people who havent tried the raid lairs or prestige levi yet and I am happy to teach
I'm down for raids tonight if anyone else wants to
@here anyone up for a normal leviathan?
I'd be kind of interested for my Titan. Looking to get an EP group though for the SMG
"i just want to get the calus challenge done, it's the last emblem i need"
for the challenges
"Yeah, I need it too"
I also need that one I think
should we try finding randoms?
"I mean, I don't think I'm gonna be able to tonight. Maybe tomorrow night or tomorrow during the day?"
tomorrow is reset and the challenge changes doesnt it?
Shit. Wasn't thinking
"Yeah, it will change, which means the next time it will be Calus will be 4 weeks from now. Last week before Forsaken."
i
i'm sure people will be looking for raids. i believe theres some requirement in solstice of heroes to do the challenges for the armor sets?
Maybe? I'm not quite sure.
"im hunting region chests right now, cause thats something i gotta do"
Snagged the SMG. That's all the EP weapons now thank Christ
"gratz. ive got all the region chests, now i just need a spire completion"
Same. You busy tomorrow Ari? We could do Spire and some EP stuff. I've got the day off.
nice!!
both haha
sry didnt mean to interrupt lol
Lmao all good dude
"i work til 630ish, but after that im free"
Anyone on PC right now want to start grinding through the Solstice activities?
"I'd be game for solstice and EP later in the week for sure, Thursday/Friday and on I'll have a ton of time"
also does anyone still need to do rat king stuff?
I do.  I think I am at public events
Im still at the first step w/ patrols but I'd be happy to help out to try to bust those out later this wk too
"ooh imstill on the last step, nightfall with rat king"
or someone else on the same step
@Oathbreaker your arch nemesis
LMAO
Listen I just have this name because why not hahaha
anybody want to solstice?
what is solstice?
the event currently going on.
completely ignorant of anything going on
"basically some of the sotry missions got revamped, andyou can get 400 armor . also what the triumph are for"
I would like the 400 armor please
_the grind is so real_
I'm guessing it's not solo content
it can be
it's harder solo though
But I kick ass. Unless there's jumping involved
Well I have an hour and a half of anyone's game
"we can run through the missions, cause those seem like the hardest requirements as far as i've gotten so far"
I am in front of the homecoming lady
"hey all, if anybody else is free and interested i'd like to run a raid tonight with our clan"
I'm definitely down.
"if anybody still requires completions of eow, spire, or any prestige raids for solstice/triumphs i'd be down to go thru it"
"Oh heck yeah, I'll be free tonight after a while, so I'm down for any raid!"
I need a spire completion. I'm only on the blue armor for solstice so I don't know what the later requirements are
I haven't been in the game for a few days so i still have to check out the solstice stuff
"well, if you aspire to be a farmer then solstice is for you!"
it's pretty cool stuff but there is a lot of grinding
:((
Well I did like farming in ARPGs so I may or may not hate myself for doing this
lool
"well in regards to the solstice event, i dont think any of the armor requires completion of spire

but there is a triumph unlock for 20 points which requires you to complete EOW and spire @Arixama"
i would be interested in doing spire tonight
That's the only raid I need for the triumph. I'm gonna get me all the everything.
even the exotic ship?? 😮
thats the one for getting all the armor right?
So much farming
if i managed to do all the faction rallys this season i think i can do this?
i hope
:o you got 50 on all 3???
When is the raid gonna be? I have family over tonight but might be able to log on for an EOW
"yo! I don't have a strict timeframe, I can be on when it's convenient for the rest of the group"
im good whenever
okay cool
@Oathbreaker what times are good for u?
Not too sure. Dinner is at 6:30 EST and that might be a little while. Girlfriend is also over so I might not be able to tonight
okok dont stress it
anyone up for redux missions?
alright so I've got two friends who would like to try spire for their first time tonight
forewarning however they are a bit cancerous
"that's fine, my mic has a mute function"
I can help with raids. Haven't done any prestiege though. I'm good all day
just farming solstice right now
"alright cool, that makes 5"
"actually wait, if ron is joining us then we have 6 i believe"
"just to make sure, if we are doing spire then you should be around 365+ light"
im good
385
385 also
perfect
I'm 370
But when exactly are we starting?
does 8:15 work for everyone?
cst?
8:15 est would be 7:15 cst
we can push it back
"ok, i thought you were est but i couldnt remember"
just making sure i knew the right time
👍
i'm so close to the 400 armor
"same here, just a few minor things"
"i need 3 of the missions, nightfall and adventures"
and 5 crucible wins
The 5 crucible wins took me a while haha
"Ive got 1 story, nightfall, 3 heroic strikes, and the adventures"
"just gonna ping @RonInDune and @Helatia , does 8:15 work?"
~45 minutes from now
i can get me a tshirt now
Yeah I'm good at that time
helatia says hes good too
invites are out @Arixama @Helatia
do I have to do this stuff for each character?
Heroic strike at 279 light is not fun
why are you doing heroic strikes at such a low light?
"if your going for the elemental orbs, you can just do regular strikes"
"it seems that elemental orbs drop more often from majors, apparently a good way to farm them is to load up the nightfall and kill the yellow-bar goblins at the start and just keep repeating that"
or so i've heard
"Zeta and I just got the Legendary 405 gear. I'm not gonna be around this weekend, but after that if anyone is looking to grind out masterworks let me know"
"anyone looking to grind anything out tonight? Havent logged in since reset, blank canvas here"
I have ~1 hour of class right now but afterwards im good
I though we might try the spire raid again if we have time and numbers. We got super close last night!
whisper anybody? :))
I still need to go for that catalyst... Won't be out of work til later tho
I'm down for the whisper quest whoever wants to do it
How hard is the catalyst mission? Lots of jumping again?
it's the exact same mission. get the chests+oracles first then load back into it and complete it.
Higher light though
you'll still get one shot don't worry lmao.
Do you need a full fireteam for the chests and oracles? Or is that doable alone?
you can do those alone.
Where are the chests? When I went through it for the first time I didn't see a single chest...
they are hiddne
Figures
"haha yeah the map is so big, i cant imagine how people ever found all of them"
Especially as fast as they did
"yeah, kinda crazy haha"
"im so close to finishing the armor, just need to do the arms"
heroic strikes woo
"I need prestige raid, highscore nightfall and heroic strikes"
i can help you out with some of those
lets see if we can get a group together for the prestige raid
and we'll definitely need a third for the nightfall
id be game for NF
I'm afraid of the prestige raid.
@RonInDune if you look in the pinned messages in #destiny-spoilers we have videos of where each chest is as well as the order to shoot the three waves of oracles.
haha the prestige raid isn't bad @Arixama !
I'll be home here soon
really its okay
@thegoaliebear Thanks!
"You have to switch runners in gauntlet, right?"
im game for whatever - ll around 365-370
yeah you have to switch roles in gauntlet
dont worry its not bad
It's pretty easy
Yeet
"Im not sure if im sold on grinding out the armor on every char, seems like something thats gonna be replaced in a month or so"
do it for the ship!
wait til next week though
mayhem is back and will make the super kills some much less painful
hmm
true.
How do you get to the spoiler talk
you gotta watch a new movie before everyone else and ruin it for them
The mission was possible
Snape kills dumbledore
Henry Cavill is the bad guy
Bruce Willis is dead the whole time
IRL?
6th sense
;)
"orbs are love, orbs are life"
i mean its not as rough as faction rally
@Masrim you didn't have the `spoilers enabled` role but I added it to you. you should be able to see the spoiler channel now.
see...told you if you spoiled enough movies you'd get in
@thegoaliebear  How about hooking me up as well? 😃
sure👍
you tha bomb
@PC if anyone needs whisper i've got the portal
prestiege or regular?
regular. heroic is just on the map
oh right
"if you need to do heroic, i dont have the catalyst yet"
I'm down after this adventure
I’m down as well
Sweet!
anybody down for heroic strikes?
"It's solar, glass, and melee today btw."
ah well
no matter
if not its fine
I tried to add it. Thanks goal
ahh whos down for some destiny
"never thought of this before, but is discord free?  not for users, but for hosts"
"yep, it's free to host servers"
@Masrim Destiny is overrated! All the cool kids these days play only Duke Nukem Forever.
That's why it's called Forever!
finally got that emblem!! 400 triumph points _woo_
Congrats @Trissin ! That must have taken some grinding skills!
lol thanks ron! it actualy wasnt as bad as i'd imagined
"i have to say, the green solstice armor set is very misleading"
after the green is smooth riding
Green makes me rage. Anyone looking to raid or anything fancy tonight? I'd be happy to join in
Id be down! Anything you wanted to do in particular @Aberration ?
correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall you hadn't done all the raids yet?
"Well... I've never finished Leviathan got to Baths before we stopped. I've done EoW all the way, but haven't stepped in SoS at all."
I'm game for whatever honestly. I'm not picky I'm more in it for the experience/a little challenge
I might be down for eater of worlds in around 45 mins
Works for me!
@RonInDune this will be your first eater right?
"okay cool, yeah"
we'll do eater of worlds starting at 8:15 est (7:15 cst) then
Yay!
"Cool cool. I'll log on in a few, playing some SNES right now haha"
👍 👍
"I've got +1 as well, so we have 4 in total now"
2 more at 815 pls
I was stressing about the green because I thought we only had until Tuesday morning to get it done
alright so we got 4 people for eow
"@PC doing a fresh run of EOW, no experience necessary at all, we have 2 spots open!"
anybody want to run it with us?
"I can, but I won’t be on till around 9. But y’all can go ahead if that’s too lare"
Late
"im okay with postponing till 9, is that okay with u @RonInDune ?"
and @Aberration
"I can be on a titan or lock, whatever the raid needs"
and thats fine i have free time tonight
It's perfect actually! My code was still compiling and I needed a few more minutes.
okay sweet
SO that's like 40 mins from now?
yep
awesome
can we get 1 more for EOW in 30 minutes? @PC
WHAT'LL YOU GIVE ME
ack
5 dolla
Venmo it over
I can teach you how to fly a kite.
I live near power lines! Are you trying to kill me?!?
"Think on the bright side, you might discover electricity! And become a new Ben Franklin for our age!"
"Oh, sorry I forgot to mention I’m in Central time.  Y’all can go ahead though"
shheeeeeit
riiiip
Well we can try early tomorrow maybe?
I'm free more or less the entire day
i think we can get a run going tonight
Oh that'd be fantastic
Still need another for EOW?
I think so
Hmm so I am in home coming but there is this big white barrier keeping me from progressing
gotta clear everything
or maybe it glitched :mind_blown:
The only thing left is in the other side of the barrier lol
RIP
oh yeah
thats happened to me a lot
jump down and go to the left
I tried going around. Just killed myself. See if that works
I found the enemy placements and stuff are a bit different
"Also, is it just me or is my Ghost not speaking at all?"
nope hes quiet
ah good I though I messed up my settings
oops sorry mispaste
so @TRex1780 are you good to join us?
I'm good! I'm in orbit now and ready to go
I'll be online in 2 minutes
Can peronix replace me once he is on
I don't think it will be a very long run....
@Peronix
where are we chatting
im going to inv
i sent u a friend request @Masrim
"alright, we got thru eow and now we're gonna run leviathan"
we just need 1 person
anybody interested in leviathan tonight?
normal ?
"yep, normal"
yeah i'll join for normal
Shooshi16#1499
my btag
ill do leviathan
Im totally up for another round of levi today if we have a few takers.
im good for that as well
Anyone need heavy strikes done?  Im going to pound a few out
heading uptown for a few but if any raid-esque things start to form I'm down in an hour or so
@Masrim if you're still looking to do some strikes i have a few that I need to run
I'm in 1au right now if you want to jump in
"will need about 10 or so, but maybe then if you're still there haha"
Power just cut out will be on in a min
I already took your spot
any  wanna do soh with me
Ended up mowing my lawn. I'm still looking to hit some nightfall tonight if anyone is game in 30-45m?
"yea im in, send me an invite when you sign back on"
Cool cool. Sorry I am taking longer than expected
@PC anyone for NF - need 1 more
"Yeah, hang on"
kk
"need 1 for heroic whisper
we did oracles just need it cleared"
"hey guys, so my friend danny (littlepants) wants to do a prestige leviathan before the reset, and i believe some other people in our clan also need the completion for the solstice masterwork"
is anybody interested in running a prestige leviathan starting around 8pm est (7pm cst) tonight?
What's the LL required for that?
"If I can help, I will"
"I believe it's still 300, if you are higher than that then you will just be scaled down"
regardless of light ads will hurt a **lot**
it's mostly a matter of mechanics
You only need to wear the solstice armor to create orbs right?  Don't need to wear it on crucible
"yeah, wearing the full set is just to generate orbs"
you can just wear individual pieces for the specific objectives
That's good to know
"I'm willing to help out with the Levi, but fair warning I've only completed it fully once (this week first time haha) but it did go pretty smooth ;)"
I'd love to do it on my Titan for the milestone but I don't have any raid gear on him yet womp womp
"I think you played perfectly fine @Aberration , very well for first completion haha"
You're more than welcome to join
Great! Sign me up then. Barring any unforeseen circumstances I should be available
sweet! Anybody else for prestige Leviathan tonight? I believe @Arixama and @Helatia expressed some interest a while ago but I might be misremembering
"You can sign me up! I think Ari is working tonight, though @Trissin"
I wish I could come in tonight! Best of luck guys.
"Okay gotcha @Helatia , thanks! Also thank you Ron, we'll definitely be doing more runs of prestige levi in the weeks to come for everybody who needs a completion or is just interested in joining :))"
I need to bust out those soh armor sets
If anyone needs blue missions I'll likely be on those steps this week
I close tonight so I won't be home until around 9 central
"I'm actually on a short vacation, so I won't be back on until possibly late Wednesday night or thursday evening"
"i'll probably be down for prestige some time in the future, currently waiting for mayhem to do more soh armor requirements"
"i hate crucible, just saying"
I feel so bad for my team
Any weapon suggestions
Do you think they messed up and it was supposed to be 10 super kills and 30 guardian
And they just don't want to admit they fucked up
"@Trissin not sure what you do at prestige calus, but we have two people fixed in the throne room by having only the shadow realm people punch the psions. makes things a lot less hectic."
"oh okay, i gotchu"
"yeah i think that might be a good strat to do, we'll see how it goes"
thank you fearless clan mother
All hail!
Crucible steps for green SOH armor makes me cringe so hard
im about to embark on that
noooo wait for mayhem tomorrow
Ehhh yeaaa
probably should
finish all the other green objectives but leave the guardian and super kills
gotta warm up my grav lance for maximum meta trolling
loool
"For the rec, I can't stay up super super long tonight since I have to work in the AM - 9 cst may be a bit late for me :\"
Ugh 5 hours PvP 37% super kills. Suck+Hunter= torture
:(((
Can someone log onto my account and do it for me lol
@Trissin lol no problem. it just makes it easy to optimize the shadow team for damage. that way the two in throne room can use their supers freely and really focus on adds instead of having to worry about punching a psion as well.
Anyone up for some heroic strikes?
"hey all, sorry I know we were going to do a run through of prestige leviathan tonight but there's a storm right above my place rn and my power's already gone out 3 times today"
not to mention there also seems to be some timing issues since people are away and busy
"you're more than welcome to continue with the run but I don't think my power+internet are reliable enough for tonight, i'll be running it another time"
sorry @Aberration and @Helatia
Woof!
maybe next week
guess that means I'll be grinding SoH.... 💀
It's all good. It happens
anyone up to run EoW?
"im farming solstice stuff right now, how about later @Sabre ?"
Anyone game for some NF?
"littlepants and I need to do nf, but littlepants needs to get his blue first"
Cool cool. I need to get on that too...but the crucible. Blah
it makes me so sad
so do we not the full set of SOH gear in crucible?
"So if we were to run a prestige leviathan tomorrow night, who would be available for that?"
"I probably will, but I can't confirm until around 4 PM tomorrow"
I don't think I will :(
I'm gonna be back to weekend duty most likely
I'm down if you don't mind me having limited experience with the raid
hey id be down and im sure Zeta would be too
hmm... how much experience do you have @Peronix
"I’ve done the room with the patrolling war beasts, the room with the three staffs, and a little of the baths"
hmm... what light are you?
"also, have @Sabre or zeta completed prestige leviathan before?"
might be a bit of a challenge with 5 people who havent done it before
we can give it a shot though
how does starting tonight at 8 EST sound?
Right now 352 but I’m grinding the solstice armor for 400 and almost got it done. Just need Crucible wins and some more arc super kills
oh yeah thats high enough
finally got the ship!!!!
my god
what a grind
Congrats dude! Does it look good?
yaaaassss it looks cool!!
"hey sorry, i ended up being busy last night so i couldnt join in. Im trying to grind the ship out too its tough"
dont worry about it!
all good 👍
alright haha im trying to cram in as much of this event as I can cause im gonna be busy so much during it between moving to school and being out of town for a week on top of that
yeeep yeah haha
how are far are you on your solstice armor sets?
"about halfway through the second scorched set. Hopefully will have it mostly done with Rekindled by tomorrow. I finished the entire first set in 2 days so if I need to reproduce that grind, I will lol"
I love the Estival Excursion too much to pass it up
"jesus , 2 days"
I had to play through the story on a third character cause I didnt have a titan yet
impressive haha
yeah haha it was brutal but it worked
oh no
"well let us know if you need help with any of the solstice stuff, im sure we'll be able to help out"
"will do for sure, I appreciate it"
I could use some help on solstice
soooo does anybody want to do the prestige leviathan tonight? @PC
Roger
"great, that would make 4 with littlepants and I"
2 more for prestige leviathan?
Ah darn I would have but I just made plans to go out with a couple friends
@TheCnC and I would be down
To attempt at least
"okay, awesome"
are we all good to go right now? @RonInDune @Peronix @Arixama @TheCnC
Give us like 10?
Oh sure I'm coming online
I’m good to go
"sweet, we'll just wait for cnc and ari"
Oh I also have the keys remaining  from last night's raid
"oh yeah, right, we need to do that before tuesday"
ty for reminding me
Alright when are we starting?
just waiting on @Arixama and @RonInDune
I'm ready
go ahead and join up on me in orbit
will do getting in now
ari should be shortly behind me
Coming up now
okay we're in the voice chat
Good luck guys!
thanks!!
"Thanks for a fantastic raid guys! I apologize for being whiny towards the end, but we got it!"
"it was a long one and we all got a bit whiny, its definitely ok"
Trying to bust out a blue set this weekend. Anyone want to do nightfall in a few hours or maybe tmrw?
@Aberration is it just completion or the highscore run?
It's just completion. I believe...
Blue warlock set
oh okay we can run that easily
just let me know when you're on
Sweet deal. Thanks much! I'm taking a half day today so I'll probably be on in a few hrs
"i work at 2 cst, so if its before then i can help"
@Arixama I just got weasel'd and now have to wait a few thousand years to log back in
Anyone know how to take screenshots of D2 stuff?
Guess you're not playing this afternoon
Howd the prestige run go last night?
"hey gang, anyone up for that NF?"
"that is, if you can login within the next millenia?"
lol RIP @Oathbreaker
btw im good for that nightfall @Aberration
hey lmfao so Zeta didnt know this was a text channel because the i think the role assign bot is offline
oh no lol!
i just gave him the role
he should be able to see this channel now
"i'm in game, ready to go when you are bud - thanks for the help 😃"
haha welcome to our pc chat @zetaa !
I'll jump in the NF
is this the secret channel youve all been hiding from me
"he was like ""man i wish we had a general chat for just PC players"" and i was like oh we just use the lfg channel and he had no idea what i was talking about lmaoo"
rest in pepperoni
its okay hes here now
Whats up homies.  Anyone need H Strikes or NF?
"I could probably do some, still on greens though"
So much easier I might get all 3 chars done today in a couple hours
37 to 87 in 20 min. The first 37 took hours. Haha
Yay blue on one
Im doing missions now
@Masrim if you want in
Cool. I'll jump in
Hate trying to grind orbs in strikes and the other 2 people don't have any master works
Just load up the nightfall and goring the first area.
Grind*
"^^
this works"
"I killed everything but the Knights, got the orbs, let the knights kill me, repeat."
Wish I knew that before haha.  2 sets blue now. 1 to go
Are you grinding all the greens first?
Almost finished all 3
It's such a weird grind scale
Sure is
Got my purple on lock today. Pretty happy about that. Working on Titan now will need to do all redux for blues if you need them Masrim
Need to do Green on my Titan. If I do it fast enough I'm considering leveling up a Warlock
So it turns out I need to do the crucible milestone to get Mayhem. Well.
This sucks.
Yeah. Have to do 2 quick and 2 competitive.  The comp goes fast if you get survival
Finally found something good about The nokris strike. Great for orbs
I fucking hate crucible so fucking much. I don't enjoy this at all.
I used to be able to play so well in D1 but it feels so different that I just can't do a damn thing.
Crucible makes me rage
It's antifun for the most part
It's so antifun for me.
I didn't mind mayhem
Mayhem is fine for me because it's chaos but expected chaos. Quickplay can be horrible and don't get me started on competitive.
Finally. All 3 green done. Fuck you orbs
I'm hoping to get Titan Green Armor before weekly reset
Can you mix green and blue in missions. I mean 1 person with green one with blue
And get the person with Green to start them
For some reason they seem easier
anybody for a heroic whisper completion?
anyone help me with whisper quick so i can get cat done
"If you can manage to have a green set, you can put it on to start the easier mission, then switch to blue. Idk how to have green and blue at the same time but that's what I've heard. Maybe get the green and vault it or put it on another char until you upgrade to blue?"
You vault it. Tested it the other night.
Dang protips
Anybody looking to do so missions?
So you vault your blue?  Or do you have to vault your green and get another green
"Vault your greens, then interact with the statue."
What if all you have is Blues
Then youre screwed.
Why didn't you tell me this yesterday
"But if you party up with someone with greens, and have them start the missions that works."
"I'm still all green, so I can join in in about 30 minutes"
I'm trying to get on abberat ion and Ron
I've also got greens I need to do missions for
Need to do some missions myself. Still on Green Titan Armor lol. Got the crucible done though
I will have a bunch of time tmrw around 6est
The most magical thing happened this morning - 5 win streak in crucible to knock out the blue req for my titan
congrats!!!
It was the best. Anyone need those Redux missions?
i do
Great
"I gotta whip up some dinner real quick, want to bust em out in 30-40m?"
definitely
nice
OK im about ready took me an hour D:
sry bout that
not a problem
Can I join in?
oh yeah sure
Yeah I just ragequit out of the first chosen mission haha
haha yeah they're a bunch of fun
who wants to rock and roll
"alright, round 2, any interest in prestige leviathan?"
"mango, littlepants and I will be doing prestige leviathan tomorrow night"
"no exp necessary, mango has never completed prestige before"
good chance to masterwork the chestpiece 👍
what time you guys thinking?
"for now it's about 8 ET, so 7 CST but we're very flexible with the time"
we can push it back and forth
i should be able to join if you need me
"gotcha, ty ari"
"no problem. if theres someone who needs it for the masterwork, they definitely have priority over me cause ive got it."
"I won't have good internet where I'll be, so I'll have to skip. Good luck!"
thanks ron! 2 more for prestige leviathan tonight at 8 ET (7 cst)?
Wish I had my legendary set done. Getting close though
do u need any help with it?
I think I'm pretty much done on the one. Just need to run chosen. Melee kills grenade kills and crucible
oh ok
lmk if u need a hand
Will do.  Going to try to get this one done tonight. Except for crucible
Then move onto my other one that is partially done
Trying to get all 3 legendary before the 28th. No idea why since it is moot in September
obviously for the ship
"also, for your melee kills, get yourself a sword that the same energy type, empty it ammo, and then kills will count."
Ship?
Oh yeah
I think that only works for Hunter and Titan
The sword thing
Nice
If you're Warlock you can use apotheosis veil and sparrow to refill melee
I just run around Nessus and punch things. That place with the big jump has a constant spawn
But not a huge one so it gets overwhelming
Any good places for grenade kills?
which class?
This one is Titan. But I have to do all 3
I wish I was still unemployed lol
"titan is arc grenade kills, right?"
insurmountable helps a ton
i still need chosen and spark for my last set legendaries if you need help
Sounds like a date!  Tonight around 8?
"depends on if they need me for the prestige run, but if they dont, definitely."
Ok sounds good. Either way I need then both for my other 2. So whenever you need it
So I got a really good deal on an iPad for my wife.  Ordered it and got a cover too since the price was good.
Cover and iPad are shipping separately
Cover requires signature for delivery
iPad does not require signature
Wtf!
seems legit
btw @Arixama we are not going to do the raid tonight
"Alright, good to know! Works pretty well cause my parenta want to go out to dinner."
"um, I thought I was plan b"
"When I get home, definitely. Shouldn't be too long of a time."
You eating pizza again
i promise i eat things other than pizza
whoooo still needs redux missions?
I need some. I think most on my Warlock and 1 on my Hunter . I need nf on all 3.
On a good note I got a BD from crucible last night
nice! BD will be good looking forward
i have 1 more H Strike that im on right now then if you want to bust out a mission or 2 I'd be happy to
just finished
Won't be on for a bit. Need to walk the dog then see what the wife has planned for me
Gotcha
i have escaped her clutches momentarily
"@Masrim im back, up for any redux?"
wondering if anybody here still needs a completion of prestige leviathan? @PC
"MangoHead and LittlePants still need to do a run, I'd like to do it with them some time this week"
"please let me know if interested! we'd appreciate the help, no prestige exp necessary :))"
I need to do one at some point before the event ends.
we'd love to have ya
I might be able to help out. Depends on timing of course
I'll be available on Sunday evening onwards...
"I’d love to go, but I won’t know my Sunday schedule until tomorrow evening"
@Trissin is stil need a completion i have done all the encounters tho
okay yeah thats fine @Bobthedog !
Whens the run?
"haven't decided on a time yet, haha"
are you good with tonight or tomorrow night? around 8pm est
"If that’s the case, is there still room for one more?"
yep!
that should be a full team
hey! are you guys good @Bobthedog @Thawxtem
I actually cant sorry thanks for invite
alright... is anybody open to running a prestige leviathan tonight @PC ?
Finishing dinner @Trissin
no worries @Thawxtem !
actually i was thinking of doing it tonight @Sabre
"I think he was asking the hour, not the day"
i think in about 15 minutes @Sabre
do u need to push it back?
So at x:30?
Invite me when you’re ready. I’m going to be doing Flashpoint: Titan
will do!
are you okay to join us tonight @Sabre ?
Do you know if there are any special ghost abilities for Levithan?
special ghost abilities?
Ex: “gain 10% more XP while in strikes” is on my ghost
oh
yeah contender's shell has perks for levi
Exotic?
yes its exotic
Figures. Thanks anyway
"yep, np"
@Trissin If you still need a sixth i can help but no guarantee of how long i can stay for
Shit sorry guys got caught up and didn't see these
anyone know what this expired ramen coupon is for?
pretty sure it's just there for the lore
it's a message from cayde
"i think bungie confirmed that there is no second part of the quest, it's just to inspect and read about cayde"
"hmm weird, mine just says  good for a free gyoso or something"
oh i have to hit e to read more
"Yup. People are speculating all kinds of things, but bungie has said its just a gift from cayde."
"Gonna be close on my Titan for solstice armor. Need super kills, Nightfall, Crucible wins, 2 more strikes, Void melee kills, Adventures, and then all the missions."
It'll be super fucking close lol.
you can make it!
"for void melee kills, super kills count btw so I can just run around shield bashing everything with doom fang pauldrons"
(also you can grab a void sword and melee things with it once it's out of ammo)
@here would anyone be interested in running heroic stikes and a high score nightfall later on today so I can finish up my masterworks?
"I would love to help with Heroic strikes tonight, I need them for blue solstice armor. I get off of work at 9:00 CST"
I'm gonna do the Whisper shadow thrall room for my super kills. Strikes are done.
Will do the whisper room for the void melees as well
"Then it's adventures, NF, crucible, and missions."
"The adventures and missions are gonna be okay, the NF will be alright, it's crucible that I'm worried about (Ari can attest to the last time I had to do PvP and how defeated I sounded)"
I have my Hunter left for armor...stuck on crucible supers. So mad about it and I don't even know if I want to do it
It's antifun for me
"After about 5 hours, oath still hadn't managed 5 wins in mayhem. Awful luck."
Wood
Woof*
"I was able to finish that two days ago without mayhem. It was a pain, but it’s possible"
I usually don't have problems with wins it's really just super kills. Maybe I'll try golden gun
I used arcstrider
What I have problems with is actually winning.
"Arc is OK but it seems that the folks I've been matching with are smart, stand their ground and unreasonably accurate"
Or maybe I'm just bad. That's a thing too haha
Are you using your dodge?
Someone here gave me the advice to use the set that makes you harder to kill when dodging and spam it. Got me close enough for at least one kill typically
Yeah it just takes forever to get 30
its a sad time
As I said: Ari knows my pain from my Hunter attempts. Titan is gonna be interesting as well.
Titan was easy compared to Hunter. Way easier
the worst part about hunter is you hav eto do the 20 challenges. titan and warlock its just defeat enemies
Is it worth it to try and get Legendary Solstice gear on a Titan I haven't created yet?
"Also, Heric strikes anyone?"
*heroic
the biggest question is if you want the ship
Remember you have to complete the story to get the tower.
but getting through the story...
Until you hit the tower you won't get the green armor.
"Ya, and that's my main stopper"
"Max vanguard rank and get ship, or save tokens for Forsaken?"
Personal opinion: Max Vanguard. Gets you the ship and a MoT
PSA: Clean out your postmaster today
Update is available for download and it's a doozy.
36 gigs or so.
36!! Can you go by my house and get it started for me
Only if there's pizza waiting for me
There should be dominoes there
"New nighthawk with random perks -- Bow Targeting, Fusion Rifle Targeting, Hands on -- Rocket Launcher Reserves, Sword Reserves"
Sweet jeebus that IS a big update
omg its almost like d1 again
The new gun system is .. confusing
"@RonInDune takes a bit to get used to. I'm sure there's a way to differentiate between primaries and secondaries. I thought I saw a post on Reddit saying that if a gun is angled to the left then it's a secondary, while to the right is primary. I could be wrong though"
"That's accurate for kinetic vs energy, but not for ammo type."
It'll probably be a lot easier once forsaken drops and we have a whole campaign of getting new weapons to actually get used to the new system.
I'm looking forward to more diversity in loadouts. I feel as if I've been very stagnant in what I use
Super busy week I haven't even logged in since the patch
I havent even downloaded the patch yet RIP
RIP your internet bill. 36GB dude
"I just t re-downloaded the whole game on Ps4, 35gb base, 45gb patch."
Back in my day games only took 4 floppies to install and any game above 3 MB contains too much fluff.
"Let's petition Bungie to reduce game size by 99%, they've got to listen to the customers."
Do that and destiny just becomes a clicker.
I don't know. I remember lands of lore or something that was like 44 discs
"so I download 36gb, then I have to download another 7gb?"
"its been sitting on initializing for 30 minutes, sigh"
i just downloaded the patch today
I had the exact same problem
i was stuck on initializing forever
"i think you have to fix it manually @Masrim , it will just say initializing forever"
and it's a fairly lengthy process
if you are still stuck on initializing just send me a quick msg and ill try to help you out
Anyone want to jump into a private match real quick? Want to test the OHK range of the new shotgun I got.
It literally was ready to play just as I got to to go to bed
I'm taking it as a sign to not play yet
Whose going to be playing gambit tomorrow?
"Definitely me. Can't wait to try it, looks super cool."
SO.. big update = even less to do?
Big update = get used to new weapons system so you don't have to learn it when the big new stuff to do goes well in.
"Also the only things gone are trials, heroic strikes and scoring on prestige nightfalls I think"
perfect paradox/ auto or scout/ whisper
they really got rid of the variation
PP can be replaced weith ikelos sg if you have it
I've heard that there's a auto leveler?
"I have only two characters at lvl 30, one char at almost max light"
i got a piece of new armor with bow/pulse stabilizer and arc protection
Not yet. After forsaken there will be a level 30 boost that i believe skips the main campaign. Most likely will also give some sort of armor at 345 if I had to guess.
It's also impossible to judge what they did or didn't do as far as gun variation right now.
I think the boost is the same as the spark of light from D1 where it just instantly levels you up
i cant recall for sure but i think you got a set of basic and somewhat under-levelled armor as well
That's cool. I don't think I would grind my third character to max level fully otherwise.
Currently working on that myself. Trying to get my Warlock through main campaign and to 30.
Who's up for some Gambit?
it's out today?!?!?
is today that trial thing
24 Hour Trial
"Anyone's up for it, just @ me and I'll party up."
I'm a bit busy today but I'll see if I have some time to hop on and play some gambit
tell me how it goes!
Will do!
It's so fucking fun.
Like 10/10 fun.
!!!!!!!
i have to go out in 10 minutes but ill make time for 1 match haha
Grouped up with some randoms and we smashed our first team
So much fun
nice!!!
Where is it on the director?
Between strikes and crucible
"i think its just under strikes and crucible, in its own little thing"
I'm going to guess the drifter isn't in the tower yet?
Nope
Not that I'm aware of
"There's no rewards, right?"
oh my god that is so much fun i want to play this forever
"i matchmade with some randoms and wrecked the first team, it felt awesome"
This is too much fucking fun
Waaaay too much fun
Wait...good pvp?
what is this
"""pvp"""
That's probably why haha
I can't wait to try it honestly.
"I mean I hate PvP with a passion in D2, but Gambit is just too much fun. You have those crazy moments where you take down someone during an invade who's looking to bank 15 motes, total team wipe, or both teams doing this crazy damage race through the Primeval's health bar. I love it."
"It also gives me incentives to get better at PvP, so I can become a much more effective Invader and not just be a defender."
"Additionally, it's a fast paced and frantic mode that it's chaos in the best of ways."
anyone interested in helping me get the wotw tonight?
hey @storyteller sorry I was busy today! Im not 100% sure of my schedule tomorrow but if we are both on at some point I would be more than happy to help
"@Trissin Thanks! Tomorrow I won't be able to play at all, I have some family plans. I'll be back Monday though"
"I can probably lend a hand on Monday as well, will be on and off all day"
also - LFG Nightfall need to run it on 2 chars
I can hope on for a quick NF
"So if anyone wants to go for anything, I'm down!"
Just got back. If NF is a thing I still need it @Masrim im @RonInDune
Sure I'll join in
SO turns out the nightfall doesn;t unlock if you don't log out and back in in somce cases. Interesting.
Anybody want to do one last  raid later before forsaken drops tomorrow?
Heck yeah!
"Looking for about 6 half hours from now, but anytime after that I can do too."
"Yup, that's good enough for me as well."
@here anyone else up for a raid later today?
What raid are we gonna bully?
Anything works for me.
Eater was the easiest for me. Though prestige Levi was pretty fun too.
Is @Trissin  available?
I think it just depends on how much time people want to put in.
"hey! i'd love to do a raid today, although I have a few things to do at 10pm ET (7pm PT)
not entirely sure how long it will last, but I should be back on around 11 ET"
I am free anytime before that 👍
Sounds like we've got four? @RonInDune @Trissin @Oathbreaker
"I'm a maybe. Got college orientation tomorrow so I do need to get things ready for Wednesday classes. We get a group, I'll definitely try to join for a while."
"depending on the time, Id be in as well"
"I might be a bit iffy on the time as well, I've got to head out for a bit right now and I am not too sure when I will be back. Don't hesitate to replace or start without me! (sorry in advance !)"
@PC How is everybody enjoying forsaken?????
Only played a bit but enjoy it a lot!  And bows are amazing\
its been a lot of fun so far
just been doing story with @zetaa
we're about to jump into Gambit
good!! i just started as well
and ive been having a ton of fun
its really good
ugh another update?
guess I don't play tonight lol
Super super fun for me. Damn college having to start the same day though hahaha.
I love the new area!
the bow is super bad ass
Forsaken story finished! Max level! Good day!
Yasssss to everything
I hate you all for having time to play
I was busy yesterday and barely played ahhh
The bow feels real nice. At least the one I got.
It's got timed payload
!loadout
This one? The one from Petra?
"""no turning back"""
I want to play so bad
"I'm lucky I only have a few classes this morning, I'll have the afternoon to play :))"
Do we know the recommended light for the raid?
i dont think it's been announced yet
although I really want to get a team together and try it blind
would you guys be interested in that?
"we can put it off a little bit, since I imagine the light requirement will probably be pretty high"
and we will need some time to reach it
let's do it blind!
Thawxtem and I are 500 already so we are down
"Gimmie, our new guy and one of my friends, isnt far behind that either"
oh nooooooooooo memory of cayde
:c
"but anyway that's awesome helatia, if we have the people at high enough light then we should definitely give it a try"
"I'm 501 and working on getting higher, but I'd definitely be down."
Same. Working on the legendary engrams and powerful ones to up that light
"@PC If anyone wants help, or just an extra hand, with the story tonight feel free to message me."
I'll be on after 9 central
WHen does the raid drop?
The 14th
"Oh I have the weekend to max out power, that's good"
"Honestly If I had to guess, recommended power will probably be 570 or so"
Oh crap I'm out of town when the raid drops
"I'd love to try the new raid, but I've only ever completed Leviathan once, and I'm curious if it would be a whole lot easier at 500. I'd love to try it a few more times, at least once, before the new one comes out if anyone would like to help."
"yeah, we should take you through EOW, Spire, and the prestige raids"
could probably double as training to lvl 50
Id be down to do any and all. I super want to test out bows and stuff
ohhhhhhhhh that's going to be a lot of fun I imagine
"I'll be interested to see them on gauntlet, to see if they stick around on the buttons."
I doubt it though.
"When would you be available? I’m off the rest of today, tomorrow, and Saturday"
I'm available tonight after like 6ish. Then Thursday and Friday.
Gimmie will be on after 7ish and I will be on after 9ish
What do we want to run if we do?
"As I said, I’ve only done it once, so I’m not sure about the 3rd yet"
So either leviathan or eow would probably be good.
And it sounds like we've got 4 depending on times.
"I think EOW sounds great, shouldn't take too long either"
we'll see who's available at around 7pm ET (6 CT)
"Trissin, Arixama, Helatia, Thawxtem, and two more, yes?"
Helatia said Gimmie will be available... but I don't think i've played with him/her before
I was with him doing forsaken story last night
"Just joined guild, or tried to"
I'm available THrusday/Firday evening!
You got your times wrong @Trissin
6 CT is 7 ET
crap
my bad
sorry haha
holy carp the adventures in the expansion are awesome!
May be too early for Helatia. He said around 9 CST
Curious to see if everyone from the raid talk is playing right now
Anybody want to run the nightfall?
"Just for completion, not a score run"
What's the power requirement?
im in
Recommended 540 but I'm gonna be going in around 510
Welp 1'm 502
"if i could get help finishing up this heroic adventure, that'd be swell"
yeah absolutely ill join in
"Good luck,, brave warriors"
"also ron 502 is fine, things will just hurt a lot"
"Hey guys sorry for rushing out at hte end, my roommate came in and wanted to talk"
Tanks for a great nightfall though!
"No worries at all, it's all good 👍"
That was quite the nightfall
I had fun tho
apparently this is how levelling your light level works now: https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e2l75/the_power_leveling_system_has_been_changed/
"Definitely seems like it. I'm only getting a few power boosts now from powerful engrams. I don't remember what my clan xp engram dropped at last night, but I think it was 520 something"
"ohh, I didn't know about this, thank you!"
I'm at 519 currently
im at 511
SO getting to 600 will be a nightmare
"also, i need to do some gambit + crucible + EP with clanmates so if anybody else needs that, hmu"
Heck yeah I'm down later tonight
Do we know that the ep drop is this week?
"im not sure, sorry]"
Max gambit rank is 15000 points.
Also if we can get 4 for gambit later we should try to go for the secret triumph
the 60 mega-drop thing?
its an emblem right?
Yup.
"This week ep drop is sniper, next week is all"
ah ok
"i dont think we have to finish it, just clear 3 waves"
If we've got the people we should finish it though. I know I don't have any of the weapons.
yeah i guess we may as well just do it haha
"remember the weapons arent guaranteed drop though, it's rng"
I didn't realize that they drop from the boss and not the locked chest.
"yeah, they come from the boss"
it's quite common to try and 'farm' the boss by failing level 7 intentionally
Like killing it at the last possible second right? So it dies and drops loot but technically you've failed
"I need to do the 10 EP level clears for a quest, so that'd be excellent"
Nascent dawn?
yup yup
IS geomag stabilizers a forsaken exotic?
I don't recognize the name so probably.
Does it have the forsaken emblem in the corner?
"Cool, so losing 5 crucible matches in a row was worth something"
Oh yeah it does now that I check
Silver linings!
what's geomag stabilizers
whaat
yes apparently its a new set of warlock boots
Yeah give us those perk details!
oh no woops
Geomag exotic
OH MY GOD GIMME
Start losing in the crucible
I want chromatic fire really though.
Adds elemental explosions to precision kills I believe.
And it stacks with ace
wait wut
hows that gonna work
double explosions??
Triple actually.
triple??
._.
Firefly and chromatic fire has an immediate and a timed
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e288e/ace_of_spades_chromatic_fire_fatebringer_on/?utm_source=reddit-android
wait what chromatic fire has _two_ explosions_???
Apparently.
I think bungie just wanted explosions for everything.
"Explosive arrows, dragonfly and firefly, chromatic fire, two tailed fox."
Everything
"yep, yeah"
lots of explosions haha
_what if you could roll dragonfly on a bow_
I have it on subtle calamity.
wait what
serious
Yeah.
"_oh hey banshee, how's it going, i've got these 6000 gunsmith materials here_"
Haha
I was using it during the nightfall and heroic adventure.
I have to get me one of those
it sounds amazing
It's real good.
Better than no turning back.
honestly I havent noticed much of a difference between the two bows
With dragonfly it's just good cause it does the aoe on precision
Plus it let's me use perfect paradox when I want to
"yeah, it's a good balance of different ranges and DPS"
Guys what's the best way to grind out advanced paradox amplifiers?
Crucible or strikes
Try and double up on something else you need to do
OK yeah that sounds easier then the heroic story missions I've been doing
"Especially if you just hop into a normal strike on the map. Xol is a pretty easy one. If you need taken kills too, run Lake of shadows on earth."
"Depending on the story mission, I don't think they are too bad"
I ran the Warmind mission on Earth 3x for the weekly milestone pretty fast
"But definitely multitask if you can, go for something that will net multiple objectives at once"
like ari suggested
Yeah that's a good plan. I dislike the mercure heroics anyway
It's heroic adventures right?
yup
I'm which were you running?
I was doing all 3 available on mercury again and again
The runner is the easiest one by far.
It's just the run up through the infinite forest that's boring
Yeah it's awful.
What time are we looking at for EP @Trissin
"ou, I don't know"
let me check the boss this week
The one you shoot in the back
ohh the ogre right?
"alright that one isn't too bad, i think we can do it with at least 5"
@PC is anybody interested in doing some escalation protocol today?
im down for EP
"I would prefer later in the evening, but otherwise I'm available as well"
I can get on  whenever.
"awesome, that's 4 people"
"who knows, maybe some randoms will join us along the way"
when are you free @AY AY RON and @RonInDune
How many do we need? I've had a devil of time doing it with 3 people
I'm down post 8 PM Central
anytime after 8pm est
okay so it sounds like around 9pm EST which is 8pm CT
@PC EP?
Yeah I'll need around 15 more minutes unfortunately
"okay no worries, just let us know'"
im in gameso just shoot me a whisper when we're ready
unless we want to try and start finding an instance
im ready whenever as well
:S
"I am in voice for EP, everybody welcome! @PC"
Got any more room for EP?
Is anyone free Tuesday? I’m at the point of begging to do a Leviathan eow and/or sos for the first time. I’ve only been able to be in the first one once and would love more of the Leviathan drops before nobody at all wants to do it anymore.
"omg everybody left, so sorry thawxtem"
i'll be around tuesday
"I think I should be free on tuesday night, id love to do all the raids with u @Thawxtem"
Tuesday night's good for me too!
i want to run at least lev and eow before the new raid comes out
"okay, yeah, lets do it"
what time?
How about 8 CST?
Im in as well
That’s 5. 1 more.
Let me see if I'm raiding in wow first.  If I'm not I should be able to do Lev and SoS as well
When will you know?
by the end of the day.  It's going to depend on the warfront today if I can get my drop from there or not.
Oh God there's another hidden gambit triumph called protect the runner. Requires 100 motes deposited by a single person without losing one.
Is it over multiple games? I thought 75 summoned the primeval
Single game. There's at least 2 rounds per match.
And you have to win.
https://m.imgur.com/a/znLyXJt
I can get rid of all my old armor right?  no need for it anymore?
"Yeah, unless you like it."
anyone up for Gambit? we need 1 more. trying to get the secret triumphs
I'm good for tuesday
"So we've got @Thawxtem , @TheCnC , @Arixama , @Peronix, @Trissin and @RonInDune?"
Need to make sure we have a time; no one responded when I suggested my time
@RonInDune @Peronix @Trissin @TheCnC what time works for everybody?
"Anytime after 8 CST.
I can stretch to 7:30 CST in a pinch."
"I would still prefer around 8 CST like I said, mainly to make sure my day is done, dinner is out of the way, and I won't have any distractions"
I'm good whenever
I'm down for 8 CST or later
OK why are half the places in the dreaming city literally off the map? I'm in the Spine of Keres and the map isn't showing me at all...
"Also, the COnfluence is super spooky"
I explored there and made a map last night. I see it as a fast travel across the dreaming city with all the final portal destinations. Only one was dangerous because it dropped you in the middle of a taken swarm
Oh that makes sense.
Are you there now? I'm fixing to get on and wouldn't mind a buddy in the dreaming city
"Nah I just left, I did the Blind Well Tier 3 a bunch of times with randoms and I'm all destinied out for now. 

It's such a cool place, just wish I was higher level."
bummer. Nobody's around whenever I visit. I've visited several times
Aw dang. We should get the clan group together for the event. It needs a lot of people to be successful.
It would be amazing if we had multiple clan fireteams in the same dreaming city server
Yeah the clan features are severely lacking. Takes forever to get a group for Escalation Protocol as well
Never actually done EP before. I can't start it for some reason even after completing the Warmind story
"if you go in slowly, the game has time to match you with other people"
go in slowly?
"yeah, like crouch walk"
"...sorry, but I'm lost on how that fits in. Unless I'm thinking of something else"
"EP is Mars event activated by squares, yes?"
i mean fir blind well
To anyone playing right now: I would love some help with getting through the Ascendant Challenge quest in dreaming city. All you need is Tincture of Queensfoil and probably a shotgun.
oh I need to do that as well
do u think we could 2 man it?
cuz im pretty sure if u die you cant get back in
"Enemies don’t shoot at you, you just need to keep running."
yeah but those big knight do a **lot** of damage
once i finish this gambit match i can join you guys
Jump in the trees and they can’t get you

@Trissin you going to hop on?
"Yeah, a trick for getting more people in your instance of Blind Well is to slow down going into the transition zone."
"It's a trick that's been around since The Taken King with the Court of Oryx, and was also used in Rise of Iron with Archon's Forge. Basically, what happens is if you move too quickly through the transition zone (The hallway leading to The Blind Well in this case, just before you reach the new zone and the name of the zone comes up), the game will not have enough time to matchmake you into a zone with other players."
"If you slow down, by either walking slowly, crouch walking, or moving through slowly on your sparrow, you'll give the game more time to matchmake and will be more likely to group up with others. It's not 100% effective, but it's definitely a way to improve your matchmaking ability."
lol Archon's Forge
"sorry somehow I missed that notification last night @Arixama , but I'm free to do ascendent challenge today
@Thawxtem"
"I ran him through it last night, but I can help help you through it."
"Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome, ty"
im online @Arixama
been trying to solo it for the last 15 minutes
Had to run out for food quick. Will hop on asap
What's your loadout?
actually i might have it here
give me a min
"yep, i got it"
im okay now haha
thank u tho!
Yeah it's not awful.
"i was trying to run around and shotgun everything, problems occured when I ran out of ammo"
and if you die then the whole room gets reset
eventually i figured out you can just camp on a tree and nothing can hit you....
"I ran a shotgun, pulse and whisper. If I ran out of shotgun ammo I killed some shadow thrall to get ammo back. Once I popped all the blights I camped on a tree and took out the crystals with whisper"
"i ran a few tries in which I didnt camp on any trees, I just ran around with 2 shotguns and a grenade launcher"
when i ran out of ammo i had to melee some thrall without getting one-shot by the knights
I almost had it one or two times
was not fun.
"The first time I actually got the chest to spawn it glitched and when I ran up to grab the chest, Knights spawned and murdered me about halfway through the collect loot wheel."
And then I was locked out.
THE SAME THING ALMOST HAPPENED TO ME
I was like 3ft from the chest and everything spawned again
"i panicked, opened the chest and got the fuck outta there"
I just gave up for the night and had oath help me with it later.
"I don’t see why you wasted Whisper ammo, the crystals were a one-shot with a bow"
Save it for knights or a backup shotgun I say
I had two shotguns the first time 🤣
Gave me a sniper I could sit in a tree with that I was used to.
Since we've got so many people online... does anybody want to do Eater of Worlds @PC ?
I can in just a bit
I’m down
Eyyy
How soon we looking to start?
as soon as we can
as soon as we  get 6 people lol
sabre and zeta said they can join as well
Ok coming on now
"I am on my way home, so if you don't get anyone before I get home, I'll join."
i think thawxtem is going to join
ari if you would prefer to go that's fine.  I was just saying I was available to fill if needed
I’m in
Is Trissin leader?
"Sure, you can join up on me now"
Need to switch characters
@TheCnC you done eater of world's ever?
nope but it's ok if you want in
Nah you do it. You need the experience.
ok lol
"if you guys need someone, just hit me up. im in for the night."
@Trissin @Thawxtem @Peronix @TheCnC @RonInDune we still doing raids today @ 8cst?
Yeah I'm down
"I might be a bit late, sorry in advance"
"oh wait, nevermind, i confused ct and et"
I'll be on
@Trissin @Arixama @Peronix @TheCnC @RonInDune reminder: Raid in 50 minutes. I’ll be waiting in orbit at that time
Which raid are we doing? Leviathan or spire or prestige or
:p
"We could do spire, I like the difficulty."
"alright, spire it is"
"Yay! spire is the only one I haven’t done, so this will finish my trio!"
Who will be the fire team leader?
"I don't think it really matters all too much, as long as we are in the same fireteam"
"forewarning however, spire can be a bit of a communication challenge"
How so?
"I would say that spire has one of the most mechanically challenging boss fights in all of destiny, including d1"
"there are just so many mechanics, and lots of communication is required"
"buffs, symbols, and locations that need to be called out"
So more skill in cooperation than power level?
"I guess it's hard to say what's _more_ and whats _less_, but you will definitely have to be paying attention to whats going on while dealing with lots of ads"
"the issue before was that it was a high power level, but we shouldnt have that problem now"
"anyway, I think you'll see what I mean when we get into the encounters"
it sounds way harder than it actually is
I just hope it isn't a disappointment like EoW was
wut
"EoW seemed a little too easy. Idk if it was power level, but I liked Leviathan better"
"ah. well, EOW is a raid _lair_ , meaning its supposed to be a lot shorter"
"and I agree with you on that it was a bit easy, but that was probably due to the fact we have whisper of the worm now"
whisper is just so overpowered...
especially at 500...
i don't think we would've had enough damage to take him down on that first run without whisper
"and also, for shooting argos' weak spots, 2 or 3 whisper shots does it"
"it used to be everyone with coldheart or valakadyn or something just screaming ""SHOOT THE ARM SHOOT THE ARM SHOOT IT"""
it was kind of stressful at first haha
Let's go ahead and go to voice chat to take up less discord space
I remember you guys totally faked me out with the ending when I did it. Thought I was gonna die when I started getting pulled out.
sorry ron!
"the actual encounters in eow are pretty easy, but the locations and everything else are what i really enjoyed about it"
"^
solar side is *pretty*"
arc side is a little more meh
Give me a second my internet literally just died.
"~~lol ofc no worries~~ @Arixama

damn too bad for u we gon 5 man it now"
Are we joining up on Trissin?
"Raid chat, yes?"
@Thawxtem we can hear you
you can't hear us? @Thawxtem
"Alright, I think it's time to start putting together a team to tackle Last Wish _blind_ !"
I'm still way too low level sadly. I can't get over 515 somehow.
My best stuff gets me to around 520
"Yeah, it's really hard to level after 500"
I am gonna go ahead and guess the power requirement will be 550
"Oh wow, are you  at 550 or thereabouts already?"
nonono im not even close haha
but I think we should gather a team and figure out a date depending on how fast we level
"currently, the nightfall is the best way of levelling up a character"
"Also, if we are going to do it blind, we have to take _every precaution_ not to follow any updates on twitch, youtube, reddit, etc"
"anyway, i just wanted to get an idea of who might be interested in doing it blind"
Everything I know is this: ?
once we are ready of course
"i would love to be a part of it, im not sure exactly what power level ill be when it drops though. probably will be a bit over 520. willing to stay off the internet in preparation haha"
"I think just 520+ should be good enough for the first few encounters at least, I don't expect us to finish it"
Unless you guys do it on Monday I won't be around.
noo ari!
gives us more time to level anyway
I'm out of town and away from internet access until late Sunday night.
I'm sure mobile data works fine for online gaming.
Unfortunately I don't have a wifi card for my pc 😭
"don't worry about it, we can push the date back a bit"
Plus I'd rather not drag my desktop across 2 states. 🤣
"If you guys end up doing it without me, my only request is for screenshots."
"well we'll see how it goes - how many people are interested, raiding experience, power level, free time, etc"
"That being said, if anyone wants to help me out with this week's ascendant challenge later today that'd be great."
"absolutely, let's do it together"
I'd love to!\
"while we're at this we can also do gambit, crucible, other clan stuff"
I actually need to kill 4 of the knights there for the better mod for the dreaming city gear
maybe some escalation protocol as well
Awesome. what time are you guys around?
wait u need to kill them??
I am actually free atm
I can get on now
I won't be home until around 630.st
Cst
so about an hour and 15
"I think I should be good then, but honestly I can't say for sure at this point"
"@Trissin after giving an offering to the machine, you get a quest to kill 4 there and fix the curse half of the armor"
If thawxtem is on you should go ahead and do it with him
"oh I haven't turned in that bounty yet, im waiting to turn in 3 at once"
"I'm leaving tomorrow morning, so I'm trying to get as much done as I can before I go."
gotcha
The quest you get from the oracle has different requirements.
Ascendant challenge will be weekly #3 for me
"gotcha. well, that was my quest this time"
"Yeah, the one I have requires a plague of the well killed while ascendant"
"@Arixama I'm getting on now. If you care to do ascendant challenge, join me in general chat"
i thought he still needed like an hour
until he's home
"oh, misread. sorry"
"That's Ok, there was a lot being said in a short amount of time."
alright im hopping on now
i suppose ill get on too
"You guys ever see the small ball of light in the challenge? I got a daily quest to find it again, so please help me keep an eye out for it"
i dont know what you are talking about
its the toland  balls
Just pulled a Borealis from Ikora's engram. So. So. SO. Fucking. Happy.
Bungie is apparently offering a jacket to people who complete the raid before Tuesday.  So anyone feel like tying the raid  tomorrow night?
"I would, but my Light level is garbage and I have to be up super early the next day"
oooooh
we can see how many people we've got
I know Arixama is out of town
"If you guys get the jacket he'll be impressed, and miffed at the same time lol."
But good luck to you all!
"Well, if we ever get 6 people, I can do it at 8:30 CST.  Until then, I gotta get my guardian some gains"
"Whoaaa, there are more rewards"
If you complete the raid in the first 24 hours you get an emblem as well
"and then the world's first team are all guaranteed the ""one thousand voices"" exotic weapon"
the laser with the delayed explosion
It looks like you only need to be 520 to enter but it will be recommended 550
im so freaking hypedddd
im down to try to tackle it early. would love the jacket tbh haha
IT'S OUTTT
2 more classes to go 😢
ive muted like every D2 channel and am probably unsubbing from the subreddit until we do our run haha. im taking this too seriously
"I'm doing a blind run tomorrow so I'm in like full ""NO ONE TELLS ME ANYTHING"" mode"
"Raid's out figure I might check out the light level requirement...sees it's 550...""Nope not going to be able to touch that for a while"" lol"
Is it 550? That's gonna be rough for me then jesus.
Are any of you 550?
It is 550
Very few people in the world are 550 and up
I'm max 534.
So looks like all my time spending collecting lore instead of increasing light might not have been the best choice
"i feel that so much, i need those triumphs"
It's also like pretty rng heavy though. I've gotten pretty lucky getting the things I need to increase my light.
"yeah absolutely. definitely need to finish my engram challenges still, have been slacking on nightfall"
Nightfall is rough right now.
I can't even imagine trying to go for a high score run.
NF is super rough right now but I still need to do it for something at the very least.
Gotta try to edge out those 3 LL hahaha
"Hopefully I'll have gambit, heroic story and crucible milestone to do when I get home."
yeah definitely wouldn't be able to get that high score engram but it's possible to beat it (after bashing your head against a wall for too long)
I still have to do heroic story I think
"Yeah, Ron trissin and I did it last week."
Supposedly they put in a hotfix to fix the bugged reset from Saturday. Can anyone confirm  that?
yep. the challenges are now up
was nice to see all the icons pop up on a thursday haha
Phenomenal
Yeah it
It's fixed *
So I no longer am raiding tomorrow lmfao.
One guy in the group saw the first encounter
"Like the LL, and just basically said, welp, more than half of us won't be able to do any damage"
what LL are you?
527
Who was in the group that wanted to do raid blind? when are we doing it? I'd like to get my hands on that jacket
"Okay, I'd just like to get into the raid asap, so whenever you get on and want to do raid, please @ me and join my fireteam. When we have 6, we'll go into new Raid"
"I would love to go into the raid blind, but i won't be able to until tonight"
I'm not available until monday
nightfall anybody? @PC
i got kicked @Thawxtem @AY AY RON
signing back in now
Has any player beaten the raid yet?
@PC  Anybody want to do fresh Leviathian? Need 1
!triumphs
!score
"Guys I tried the ascendant challenge and I just couldn't do it. Is 520 too low, or are the end knights just hard?"
I think those knights are just pretty strong lol
yeah i cheesed it by repeatedly thundercrashing into the well of light at like 520
"lol, i think the other way is to just find a tree to camp in"
you are literally invincible as long as you are not on the ground'
nothing can hurt u
"Oh that's a good tip, I'll be trying that next. i just wish it didn't need the consumable every time."
Anyone down to attempt The Last Wish tomorrow? Probably won't get too far but it seems like a good time
if we wanted to get a group together im good past like 3pm CST
will prob be only 533 or so
@Arixama ?
"Ended up getting delayed and won't be home until sometime tomorrow, but if I'm not home too late definitely."
"I haven't played enough and am still at 522, I could join in if I won't be a liability."
we'll see if we can get through the first encounter
Let's do it then!
what time are we looking at trying the raid?
when will u be back??
I am already back
I can be ready whenever
I'll be in around 3 - 3:30 CST.
I have classes until 8 ET (7 CT)
"We can start then, that's good for me."
who else is joining us? @Peronix @zetaa @Thawxtem @Oathbreaker interested?
if there are too many people i will step out
Good for me too.
"I’m down, but I won’t be able to get on until 8:30 CT cause work just called me in."
"8:30 CST is about when id be all set as well, i have an hour long meeting at 7 that might run over a little"
No can do. College is keeping me busy now. Gotta do some projects tonight
@here we still attempting raid stuff tonight?
If we got enough people. I don't know who's all ready
@PC Last Wish ???
Are we doing this?
I would give it my honest best try...but I'm only 507
I'm 530
"I mayy not be able to join, actually, because i just found out i have some work to do"
oh.. I think cnc might be a bit low
I think minimum is 520
otherwise things will just be immune i think
"If we don't have enough people, we can put it on for another night if that works for everyone"
I wasn't suggesting you actually take me.  Sorry if it seemed like I was saying otherwise
"so potentially we have @Peronix @Helatia and me, right?"
@RonInDune @zetaa ?
@Thawxtem
"Just got off work today. Already ate, is there still time to join?"
I don't believe it's started yet
"yep, we're still getting people together"
Gimmie is 528 and he is considering it
"@RonInDune @zetaa
Last Wish?"
530 still shows skulls. We will get 1 shotted
"really? dang, im 521"
"Oops sorry yeah, I don't have enough time to do it now"
I went into the raid today morning and I got one shot constantly at the first encounter. I was 522.
You will need 540 minimum to get rid of skulls
Y'all might gotta count me out then till I get a higher LL
it's still fun to venture inside and figure out the mechanics
That's true
"sorry for the delay, im here now if we wanna try it"
Anyone want to try for EP weapons this week? All 3 are dropping off this boss cycle.
i got the shotgun last night.
Anyone still raid blind?
"i am mostly. i went into it last night alone and took a look around, but thats it"
@PC anyone down for EP?
I have a little time  for some EP in an hour or so...
@AY AY RON  Still looking for EP?
yea i am
trying to find a pub team on LFG
you down to join?
I have about an hour or so
k one sec lemme see if we have an instance
"sent you an invite, see if you can join"
at capacity
k one sec
"im gonna go take care of a couple chores rq, brb"
lol this pub in our instance doesnt wana team up for whatever reason
even tho he wants to do EP
interesting
I can try to load into your instance i suppose
if only there was a better way
yea we're in glacial drift
im just reloading
this is dumb. They really need the ability to join someone elses instance
i got one
can you send you btag?
he'll add you
and join on him
absolutely
btag?
Aberration#1246
misunderstood sry
nama ie kelilah
is
should be adding you now
on my way
EP still going on? room for 1 more?
yeah join abberation
he has one more spot
@here anyone up for a nightfall?
yeah im down
think we can do it with 2?
"ooh, whats the nightfall this week"
"insight terminus, exodus crash and savathuns song"
im only 538 but i dont think thats too big of an issue. we can wait a lil bit for a third but im fine with trying 2
only 538??
538 aint lowwww
im 547 now
whoa
im low in comparison lmao
also the ascendant challenge is pretty easy this week
oh good
i think im going to do the nightfall milestone last
since it awards the highest gear
"im not sure what the order is supposed to be, ive heard that youre supposed to do dreaming city + nightfall first to get high gear and then the other activities will boost it by 1 or something? not sure"
i think dreaming city actually awards the highest gear
cause its 560 or so
your call though arixama we can wait or try it out. sabre might be on in a bit but hes mid 520 i think
im on that destiny AND discord grind 😩
we did it a couple weeks ago a a pretty low light and had a kind of rough time at it. but we did do it.
"oh wait, dreaming city is 560?"
some areas for sure.
i figure if us two are at or above the light level we can do it but it wont hurt with the third
i mean dreaming city can award 560+ gear??
i got a bunch of 550+
because im thinking about how bungie said challenges will award gear based on how underlevelled you are
like an hour ago
i think there are large powerful drops up to 560 and then it starts to diminish after that
like how the other powerful drops for activities stop rewarding as high light level
it's so confusing haha
there was a post about it on the subreddit a while back. that there are actually 3 tiers of powerful drops
wanna give that nightfall a try?
@zetaa
yeah lemme finish this blind well run
on the boss
ok im ready
what do we want to run?
anything but exodus crash imo
ill hop in the fireteam chat
Anyone looking to grind EP today? I'm thinking I'll be around at 230est
Might be more available for things in the next few days. Gonna try to get ahead of the curve on most of my classes. Got work on the weekend but with some luck I should be able to actually play some Destiny over the next few days.
Oh dang when did they change the ace of spades quest? Looks like you make progress by any handcannon kills not just invaders
yeah bungie changed it recently
cuz people complain
"Thursday, I think. It was in the latest hotfix."
Praise bungo
what's the ascendent challenge this week?
Jumping puzzle with bombs and a boss at the top.
oh okay
u can solo it?
I did. Mostly a lot of jumping around the arena at the top.
ok maybe ill try it
Its a taken phalanx.
Hey can anyone help me with this week's spider bounty? It's the fight in the EDZ
@PC  I will take people to a chest in the new raid if anyone wants it
"Oh heck yeah, but i'm still 526"
Hunters will need StompEs
No combat nessicary
Can warlocks do it?
If you can jump high enough lol
Well no harm in trying!
Join in general
It will take like 5 minutes
already have the checkpoint
@Trissin You want the chest?
THat was indeed pretty cool. Thanks man!
@PC Doing another raid chest run for new raid. No combat needed. Anyone interested?
I'd be up for it later.
"Already grabbed it on my lock, no one else has the awoken key yet ;_;"
This is the bridge chest after first encounter
Secret chest
no key required
I think he means the dreaming city key.
"Oh, my bad"
Hey anyone up for a nightfall?
@PC nightfall anyone?
I'm down in like 3 minutes
"ok great, anyone else?"
"Yay I got my first forsaken weapon, 30 hours into the expansion."
"ooh, which weapon?"
The two tailed fox!
nice!!!! that's awesome
I still dont' have any forsaken exotics 😢
"I have the geomag stabilizers boots and this rocket launcher, both dropped from 500 power strikes"
powerful rewards? or just random strike drops
End of strike rewards both
i should start doing strikes more often
Yeah they're surprisngly useful still
Zavala is a stingy bitch.
he's keeping his gloves from me.
Hey anyone up for trying the ascendant challenge with me? I keep getting knocked off by the end boss...
i got you
Anyone going to try for EP shotgun this week?
I still want it ;_;
"I wish I could help, I've been so busy with classes this week"
Me too...
Haven't played at all since last reset
No worries fam. If you get time this weekend and want to crush it I'll be around
"Huh I didn't realize you don't have to do the raid to get the third subclass. You can just present an offering to the oracle and visit [REDACTED] at [REDACTED], which is probably the prettiest place in the DLC so far."
"yeah, i was surprised to learn that as well"
i agree it looks amazing
"there's also a hidden piece of lore there, did you pick it up?"
requires a bit of jumping
Did not realize that the secondary perk on geo mags increase the length of chaos reach.
They're even better than I thought
rip i still havent gotten any forsaken exotics
D:
I honestly don't know where they came from. They just kind of showed up while i was playing gambit. I assume. I got An engram drop.
"actually i think have opened a few exotics, but they are all Y1"
I pulled a prospector from a powerful gear bounty.
It's felt less bad cause it was after i got the geomags
so i guess now the question is geomags vs chromatic fire
Geomags mostly. Depends on modifiers.
"huh, interesting"
they're that good?
Oh yeah those were some tricky jumps! I was so happy to find that I could actually make it over there
"So, in between the 1st and 2nd number of the magazine in your gun is when you can start topping off."
i see
"So like with orbs and the chance of the little energy things that drop for storm callers, it's pretty easy to get up. Especially if you chain supers."
it's all about them ions
I hate these Baron missions
OATH
OATH WE NEED YOU
The Crucible Can Wait Oath
We have to save the dreaming city
Don't let our two hours in here be in vain!
WTB Light Level 570 Guardian PST
@PC anyone for nightfall?
"@TheCnC I AM SO SORRY, I'VE BEEN GOING CRAZY IN CRUCIBLE"
"Nah, it's chill"
Oh man I didn't know Destiny had a bad reputation among general gamers.
"Someone I know IRL told me I shouldn't support the game because of so many ""anti-consumer practices"" by Bungie."
Anyone know what he talking about?
"Probably Eververse. When the game launched, it was not great."
"That, or being an online multiplayer that has content locked behind dlc."
"On top of that, XP throttling in CoO. There have been a few times Bungie has been caught by the community doing something not so great. They generally fix it quick but it still happened."
That as well Ari.
"Which is kind of silly, cause that's fairly common in any sort of subscription based game such as WoW"
Oh man that's disappointing.
"But informative, thank you Ari and Oath. I'll read up a bit."
@Oathbreaker Oh I know.  I was being more sarcastic and kidding than anything.
!gambit meta pc
I've not had a single successful gambit PvP kill with the Two Tailed fox yet but dammit I'm never gonna give up.
That's the spirit!
I'm wondering.. who's free tonight?
"Thinking of raiding perhaps, if people are interested"
I should be
I am! But I'm at 541 still.
"Get off work around 7:15 CST, then have to eat. If we get a group, I’m 561-3, only one armor slot missing the Blessing mod, though clearing tier 4 well can fix that"
I'm down and I am sure Gimmie will be down as well
Heavy lighting at the moment. I’ll wait to see if it calms down
gtg
@Trissin @Arixama @RonInDune are we still good for raid tonight?
Gimmie and I are good
@Trissin @Arixama Y'all alive? lol
Sweet
"oups , sorry!!! i forgot"
WElp I'm having internet issues
COnstantly disconnecting with weasel and bee
And now saxophone
Still having issues?
Yeah I think something broke in my ISP
Sorry guys
"I'll try to join intermittently, but you should look for another meanwhile."
"Just got home from work unfortunately, work tomorrow as well otherwise I'd be so so down."
how was the raid???
im so sorry i had to go out
I too feel bad I couldn't join in. I've been getting bee errors all day.
"good, we almost got through the second encounter."
oh nice!!
is that shuro chi?
good for u guys!
what are people doing now
im going to bed
Anyone up for blind wells btw?
oh i might do some blind well
night ari
I’ve finally hit 540 LL. Just another 60 to go
gratz
Yo can anyone help me with the ascendant challenge? I keep dying to the boss.
Nf is 540 LL?
doable if you're around 530ish
Hmm..yeah I'm low 530s
"yeah that should be high enough, just cant rambo through everything"
Got it. I'll give it a shot haha
"great, i'll toss you an invite"
Raid group from Saturday... are we still going to try to finish?
"Man Bungie has seriously upped the exotic loot drop. I got 4 exotics (2 forsaken) over the weekend, roughly 5 hours of play."
😠
i still have nothing...
i got a hunter chest
Anyone want to grind for the Silicon Neuroma sniper rifle from Pyramidion?
why not
Alright I'm inviting you now in a second
Hey I need help with the ascendant challenge again... I keep getting lost on the way and the knights hit hard!
"If you still need help, im down to help. Gotta get another thing of queensfoil real quick though"
"Heck yeah, thanks man! I gave up after getting bee errored twice in a row"
"Bungie and errors, name a more inconic duo 😂"
@Trissin and getting Forsaken exotics
"Huginn gave me some Queensfoil, so I’m good to go whenever you are"
I'm clearing out the lost sector now
Is anyone willing to go through the Whisper Heroic quest a couple times this weekend?
"I've never done the heroic before, so I'm game!"
That makes two of us! Do you remember how to get past the first room? I couldn't find the taken ball
"No idea mate, let me youtube it."
@RonInDune are you available right now? I got a third that knows where to go
Oh cool coming online give me 2 minutes

that would be so nice of u
ofc
"haha no worries, all good !"
does it make it a lot harder with you carrying me?
uhh... I don't think so
I dont think it gets harder based on the # of people
is it ok if I bring a friend as well? some1 from the clan?
dont wanna abuse ur goodwill
haha of course you can bring more people
doesn't have to be from the clan.. you should be able to invite anybody

"@RonInDune launching D2, let me know when you're ready by joining the voice channel"
running by Xur first
"Alright, I'm coming online within a couple of minutes"
We do need a third though ...
@PC looking for a third for Whisper quest Heroic
what the rep for that?
?
power lvl
400 I think
"400 recommended according to Destiny, I'm at 583"
what are you at Ron?
580
"Luckily Xur is on Io this week, so I'll just be hanging out there"
Alright lemme clear some inventory and I'll join in
No third yet?
@Mr.Kaeron you want in?
"not entirely sure what's that, and what kind of loot does it drop"
started playing a week a go
*ago sorry
im at 522
"Whisper of the Worm is an amazing sniper power weapon, but it requires a quest to obtain. Completing the quest unlocks Heroic. The quest is only available on weekends, though, and can take a little bit of patience to get the right field requirements to spring the quest the first time"
oh I see
I dont think I have that quest tho
"It’s not on map, you have to kill a certain enemy during a certain public event to spawn a taken portal that leads to the quest"
"Join me if you want to try. Just remember, public events are random, so that’s where patience is required"
Just join the voice channel as well
JOIN NOW
ur in the us
cant
You can switch servers with no loss of progress
@Mr.Kaeron
not sure how tho
"I would be more than happy to walk you through, Whisper is that amazing of a weapon."
"First things first, if you're in Destiny 2, log out and go to desktop"
okay
done
"Open up the Battle.net app, and click on your name in the top right hand corner. In the drop down menu, click log out"
got it
"A new, much smaller window of Battle.net will open, prompting you to log in. You first want to click the little globe, chose Americas, and then log in. You will still need to change your region above the play button however."
GL guys!
Hey I just realized I forgot to do this week's nightfall. Anyone available?
I can in a minute; gathering caches to finish Ace of Spades
Cool cool
Last cache
"The Cayde mission is fantastic, no need to rush on my account!"
"Just caches, not mission. No spoilers!"
"Although, is it a solo mission?"
"I'm not sure honestly, I did it solo."
It is a solo mission
Time to go to Banshee
"Alright, joining on you?"
Let me talk to him then go to orbit. My computer is a potato
Sorry to make you wait
Do we have a 3rd?
Don't think so ... But we can 2 man it if needed. It's not that complicated thankfully
Join chat
600!
COngrats!
😮 congrats!!!
:yes:
could any1 gimme a hand with the blind well?
be4 the reset?
"Heads up for everyone here - word is that Benedict is selling Midnight Coup this week. If anyone's looking to get it still, get to the Leviathan this week haha"
"Oh dang I need one! 

Plus I need to do the Leviathan for the Legend of Acrius quests anyway. We should plan out a raiding weekend!"
any1 for the ascendance challenge?
I can help in the evening!
are you europe?
or na?
pff
every1 is na
Switch to NA @Mr.Kaeron !
There's not really a difference in gameplay
last time I tried
It didnt work @Trissin
fml cant find groups for anything
Well.. it's like the middle of the week
Classes and work going on
Is anyone willing to do the Corrupted dreaming city strike with me? I need a team who is willing to wait before doing stuff to get Ahamkara Bones
HEck yeah I'm down. When do you want to do it?
Whenever
I'm good Friday evening onwards.
Also Thursadya evening
"I was hoping today, but alright"
Hmm I can do today late
"Just rushing things, I suppose it doesn’t matter. How about we do it as a warm-up for Whisper Heroic 3?"
Oh that'd be good
I have to do it while ascended to get a Dreaming CIty mod
Just throw it on at final boss; bones are before then
Cool Cool
I need the bones too. I've only done the strike once.
@RonInDune I have Helatia as our 3rd. Friday evening would be best.
Perfect!
any1 would be willing to try and go for Whisper of the Worm?
@Mr.Kaeron You going for first or Heroic?
never done it
so I assume first?
"1.) Quest is only available while Xur is here (aka weekends) 2.) I may be able to help, but I need to ask someone else"
I think you guys should be able to two-man it
i would hop on and help as well but i've got lots of schoolwork...
if you still need help i think i should be able to help over the weekend
ahhhh
cool ill try it saturday or sunday then
"also, im wondering if it's possible to get a raid going over the weekend"
"Gimme2, Helatia and I were talking about a raid group"
would defo try and do leviathan raid
:kawaii:
"oh yeah, kaeron, you should switch to NA!"
keep forgetting about that...
to switch regions:
First log out of blizzard client
"Change regions on the login screen
_(if switching to EU, select europe)_"
"Finally, click the menu above the play button and choose your region
_(if switching to EU, select europe)_"
"After you boot up the game, it will take a bit of time before it displays all friends/clan members in the new region"
ahhhhhh
I think I didnt do the last bit
thanks @Trissin
No worries :((
I might be able to rock a Levi run this weekend. Depends on timing...
I can do one but not Saturday.
"On a different note, who wants to make an Omelet with me? I'm fixing to start hunting wish-ender-bow-eggs and wanted to see if anyone cared to join"
Yeah I'm down for Levi!
"Lizard, Mr.Kaeron, Aberration, Arixama, RonInDune, Thawxtem...
We have 6 people for Levi possibly if we could just set up a time and test Kaeron’s server to make sure he can connect to us"
"If possible, I’d like to try to run it twice for quest"
For tokens  for acrius?
For both I hope.
The acrius tokens I believe you can just do the first fight to unlock the door over and over I'm pretty sure.
"^
Yes you can."
Emperor Seals
Exotic quest step
"^
Yep, you can keep doing castellum over and over again for seals."
At least you could last year
"Idk if it's different now, but I don't think they'd change it."
"Just claimed Horror Story, and it spawned as my first 600 weapon!"
oh dang congrats
I'm pretty sure it's 600 for everybody. Does it have a level requirement?
"Idk, I’ve started getting 600 armor, I was just excited for a weapon to accompany them"
I need acrius too...10 seals for this guy. I also was thinking about trying to get some IKELOS swag from EP since all 3 drop this week
"@Aberration If you go for Destiny sometime tonight, I'd be willing to run EP with you"
No can do friendo. Early AM work
"Alright, alright, alright"
_let's see what we've got._
"_Fallen, on the horizon!_"
Btw im 584 @Trissin
I'm home in 30. Looking for NF and EP if anyone is interested
got lots of schoolwork :((
I'll be up in about 4 ~ 5 hours
RIP me. No problem haha
Sorry ... 😞
I wish I had speeds like this at home. I wager I'd get a lot less Bee and Buffalo errors!
That's pretty sweet. Does a higher network speed make forsaken exotics to drop?
I'll take that as a probably not
you gotten any forsaken exotics yet @Aberration ?
I actually for Trinity ghoul last week
Got*
jealousss
thats so nice!
"idk whether its actually any good, but it looks like fun to use"
Its a cool weapon. I haven't really gotten the feel for it yet
Gotta compare it's damage to a regular bow. Slow draw but it has a triple shot and the proc does massive damage
damnn
You gotta be really good at precision
"Of all the forsaken exotics, I've found Chromatic fire and Ace of Spades to be the absolute best combo!"
I'd like the chromatic for sure
ooh yeah chromatic fire looks like fun
"The sword is really bad though, black talon I think it's called."
i have 1 forsaken exotic lol
"wait, actually, i have ace"
so i guess that makes 2?
i got the heart of inmost light
Chaperone?
titan chest piece
2*
it seems.. alright? to be honest i havent noticed much of an effect from it
"it looks cool tho 👍 , matches with the reverie dawn armor"
Man I haven't played as a Titan even one in Destiny
I really should start the character out
"Titan is cool, all classes definitely have perks"
"I honestly thought reading the description that warlock would be a support mage/healer class. Which it is, kinda sorta"
That's my go to class in any RPG
"Yeah, attunement of Grace is pretty awesome"
well of radiance is pretty crazy
Wish I had picked Nova warp over chaos reach tho
Kamehameha is neat but just not as effective
you can get your 3rd seed btw
The annoying thing is that the sword you plop down for well of radiance has a big hit box
I've died so many time to rickets hitting that
*rockets
3rd seed is raid locked isn't it
I dont think so
No you get it from [REDACTED]
the 2nd one comes from either Kalli or from Blind Well
I have the blind well one. Gotta run brb 20
You get it in the 3rd curse week
"Chaos reach is OK on its own, but it's super good with geomags"
"Geomags, did those get added to the game yet? I feel like there was a teaser about some yellow engrams dropping eventually"
Oh man doing the Hive lost sector on Mars with geomags on I had my super going for the entire boss fight. It's was blinding
You just have get 1000 edge transits first and then the 1001st decrypts into a random exotic. Most likely from year 1.
"I mean, I'm all for getting my 4th vesper of radius"
any1 for whisper of the worm?
"sorry, i've got a bit of work to finish up atm"
i havebnt even done blind well yet
@Destiny [PC] Who wants to mess around in the old blind well? Get some seeds of light and some weekly bounty action up in here?
i dont have dreaming city on my hunter yet 😦
"also, still wondering if people are interested in raiding today?"
I would @Trissin
@PC ?
anybody interested in raiding?
No can do tonight. Got two mid-terms tomorrow and another on Tuesday. Things are speeding up for me rn so don't know how much time I have to play
"whoa, that's rough. completely understand, good luck on your midterms!!"
I think @Thawxtem @Gimmie2 @Helatia @RonInDune @Aberration @Arixama were talking about it before?
"I may be able to. I'll see if I can manage, just depends on the time!"
Sorry im in a strike
give me a sec to read
lol np!
Heck yeah I'm down to raid
I was trying to get the lore bones from the corrupted strike but impossible with randoms
"so I think that's 4 people we have, looking for 2 more"
I should be able to be available at some point. Just not super sure exactly when
"okay, great"
"I also see gimmie2 and masrim online right now, are you guys interested? @Gimmie2 @Masrim ?"
@Thawxtem or @Helatia might be up later I think
"I don't usually get online during the weekend, but if you hit me up monday-friday I can"
"Not atm, got some stuff to do"
if you guys are still down in about 6 hours ill be available
@Trissin what time would we do the raid?
I was thinking if we're free right now
then maybe now
I have to be off in about 4 hours
well
im down
just let me know if I'm needed to switch to NA
ok 👍
we just need 2 more people
got anotehr 1
from the clan
Tsushibi
oh awesome
I might get the 6th as well
let me check
!
Which raid are we doing btw?
good question
I was just thinking regular leviathan
but if you guys want to do something different
I dont mind
"I think last wish and spire are quite challenging though, if you dont have any experience..."
That's cool with me! I though we were doing last wish
I never done it
Leviathan is fine
would like to do leaviathan
"yeah, regular leviathan is about the right length and level of difficulty"
Plus I need the emperor seals
trissin ill start switching to na
okay?
you have a 6th @Mr.Kaeron ?
working on it
see if his online
okok
he was suppose to be able to play with me tonight
so he should be here soon
"go ahead and switch to NA, sure"
ill just start switching in the meantime
tsubashi and your other friend may have to switch as well
ill explain to em how
okay trissin 10 mins and the 6th is here
are they in this server @Mr.Kaeron ?
not sure
alright.. do u have them on discord then?
because we will need voice chat
yes I do
U guys can always gimme a link invite
and I pass to em
for em to join
can I get the link?
https://discord.gg/dhkwU9
giving em now
they just setting up
1 of em is just sorting out some lag issues
we should be ready soon
im in voice chat
you guys good @Aberration @RonInDune ?
Yeah coming online in a couple of minutes
"I'm gonna ruin it, probably only have 30 or so before I have to jet for a bit 😦"
aww noooo
Let's speedrun it then
dont think we can speedrun it.... some people dont know the mechanics
True true. When will you be back @Aberration ?
Probably not for a couple hours at least :\
"Hmm I can wait, I'm free this evening"
ok we're ready
we need another... aberration cant stay for the full run
😢
how long does it usually take?
"well since we have people who are new, probably a bit over 2 hours"
it really depends on the group I find
invite nat
I just got home from work. Sad I missed raid :nkoCry:
Yeah I was a letdown. I'm going to be available in like 10 tho...
We just finished!
Hey @PC anyone want to join us on the the Corrupted city strike? We're going on a lore hunt
Anyone wants to do 100k score nightfall today? It's the only weekly I'm missing
"I'd be up for NF today, after work"
"@Mr.Kaeron That would likely be sometime maybe 12-13 hours from now, however! Long day"
Oke
I'm up for that as well
I want that juicy NF loot
@Mr.Kaeron @naT  OK - if there's any interest in some NF I'm finally back
yes sure
wow I leveled up
👌
@Aberration how do we go about it? I never went for a high score nf
neither have I
running quick gambit for daily
how hard is to do 100k nf
no clue!
"not difficult, just be careful"
"put on some modifiers, increase the handicap"
you want to be between around 3.8 - 4.2x score I believe
id recommend you guys go into voice as well
makes coordination easier
"just play safe, u guys should be fine 👍"
I've heard going in as an all edge transit team gives you a +10x modifier
Might do raincheck this week
really tired
and workin in like 7 hours
we can probs just do a regular ez run
I'm ready when you are @naT
"Remember to do the ""Nothing Left to Say"" heroic daily for the triumph!"
what triumph?
"""You're not my sister"" vanguard triumph"
For completing a final story mission on heroic
ohhhhhhhh
I have to do Panoptes as well for the triumph but that one is harder to solo with blackout
5th Vesper of Radius drop today! Keep em coming!
"If anyone wants to do the Corrupted DC nightfall, I'd love to join! I want to farm it as much as possible"
I'm game this week. For sure.
Me too
Usually will be available around this time for an hour or two
@RonInDune you available for a nightfall now? Any ideas on a 3rd if so? Aberration is offline
"Sorry dude I'm a bit busy now. I can come online a bit later, couple of hours from now"
"Okay, I understand, maybe see you then"
@Thawxtem  I think I can squeeze in a NF run if you'd like
when do you guys wanna do another raid this week?
I’m available tomorrow and Saturday
I would still love to run a Nightfall Corrupted
any1 knows where xur is this week?
Nessus I think
watcherrs grave okay
"So I'm looking to try and get NF done this weekend for sure @Thawxtem , with 3 people it should be no problem."
Technically I have 3 characters that can run it and could use it
"Well, I would be happy to help! I work until 5:30 Saturday & Sunday"
A third would be great; completed it with 2 but it was a pain with all the ads at the boss
"I am down for nightfall, have not done one since the update"
"Eating now, I’ll be getting on afterwards so I’ll be ready soon whenever you two are."
Borrow Raid chat?
OK NBY ME
The 'A Deadly Trial' story mission is the shorted mission ever! Are there any faster missions in the game?
If you're really efficient you can one kill the mission.
Gotta love the quick ones. Best way to churn out all 3 easy
"Not true about 1 kill I'm pretty sure. You have to kill. The walker, and then like 3 enemies at the end."
Ice and shadow and utopia are also very good missions.
OH yeah you're right I forgot about the invisible weirdos in the basement
"They're easy though. Just run through the door, then turn and toss a grenade"
I'm slowly working my way to the wayfarer title.
"Ice and Shadow is slightly faster I think? 2 required kills, takes about 4 minutes to complete on an optimal run."
Is it just just or is the crucible suddenly full of really high skill but really low level players?
I'm seeing Level 10 and Level 15 players getting 10x streaks regularly
d2 vanilla is free right now
Yeah but then I'd expect the opposite isn't it?
Lots of people even worse than me
all your sweaty bois are picking the game up and going straight into pvp.
damn
@Trissin we doing leviathan this week?
I'm down for Levi at the weekend
"Yeah, some people might be creating alt accounts for just PVP"
"You guys are more than welcome to organize raids and activities @Mr.Kaeron , but I dont think I will be able to help out with anything until Friday at the latest"
Pretty busy with school this week :S
"Alright hey all, after I finish my midterms this Friday, I'd like to get a serious run of Last Wish going over this weekend (I don't expect to finish it in one or two sittings) @PC"
"I would be looking to start on Friday night, and plan more time over the weekend as needed"
Heck yeah dude I'm ready!
We'll do a no death run easy.
id definitely be down.
"As always, all are welcome to join, but I would definitely recommend some previous raiding experience as this is quite a difficult run"
we can just start off on a petras run. 😂
I'll also say it's good to be at least.. 550 light?
"Anyway, let's see how much interest we have and go from there"
"i would say 560 to be safe, but 550 is definitely doable"
"Another note is that I've never completed last wish myself, and I only have a rough idea of what's going on, but I'll brush up on the mechanics before going in"
Great!
Basically I won't be a reliable guide for this one
i've completed the first 3 encounters
Anyway
Oh sweet
You guide us this time @Arixama ! 👍
Pinned a message.
"I almost solo-ed the first encounter at 600 power, so it shouldn't be too hard."
"Anyway, I think I would be good to start at around 7pm ET (6pm CT), let me know if you're interested and free that night!"
"6cst is going to be cutting it a little close for me, but it should be available close to then at least"
"No worries, the start time isn't concrete"
We can push it back as needed
"I would be interested if y’all have room, but I also have minimal raiding experience"
Ok.... I don't really have a final answer atm - we'll have to see who else is interested and able to join - but I'm not sure if last wish is a good place to start off
How much experience do u have @Stephen ?
"The issue is that since none of our team has actually completed last wish yet, none of us are really able to actually sherpa the group"
"I would be more than happy to run any of the other raids with you, or do another run of last wish after I'm more experienced"
"and since nobody has any actual last wish experience, that's why I am putting some value on previous raiding experience, because it is such a long raid and it is very demanding as well (and I'd like to be able to finish it before the reset next Tuesday!)"
"Yeah that makes sense, I haven’t even completed a raid in d2 so..."
Good luck tho
I won't be able to this weekend because the wife will be in town. After we've moved in and get settled I would love to do some raiding
@Stephen let us know if you're ever interested in doing one of the raids! Happy to guide people through any of the Leviathans 😃
"@Helatia we'll definitely go through last wish and the other raids a lot more after this weekend, i think lots of us have just been fairly busy lately"
"@Trissin not sure if I did Warmind thing right, but I’m all in on Friday. I’m Warlock 599-600 depending on guns"
Im already at 600 @Trissin
"I'm not 100% sure if there is space left since I do have one friend joining us as well, and i'm not sure if @Aberration is joining us or whether he is sitting as an alternate"
and the other aspect might be experience since you've done leviathan once
do u mind joining as an alternate?
we'll see if @Aberration is playing or not
@McDryAnal
Wat
"Also, could we stop by and make the 14th wish before the raid? I plan on going egg hunting"
"yeah absolutely, np lol"
do u have the wish ender @Thawxtem ?? 😮
Damn that reminds me I still haven't done the Shattered throne yet.
"^
me neither"
i havent had the time to do it yet :((
18 eggs done
You on?
not atm
If we got a 3rd I could help get you the bow
"If you've got someone that can give you a fresh instance of the raid, you can do 4 of the 5 eggs in last wish alone."
"actually, how long does the shattered throne take @Thawxtem ?"
"I'd love to hop in to get the bow, but I won't be free till tomorrow evening"
"^
im fairly busy as well atm"
but thank u for the offer!
😃
"I never timed it, but the first part seems to be the most time consuming if I remember correctly. Actually, pulling secrets for the second run for the bow could take a minute"
@Trissin are you free tomorrow evening?
"Well actually, I've got a midterm on friday so I'll probably be studying for that"
It's okay
I can grab the wish ender another time
thank u so much tho
perhaps over the weekend or something
"Don’t know when your test ends, but perhaps we could meet a while before the raid?"
"just trying to get you raid eggs, too"
"my test ends fairly late, but dont worry about it haha!"
I can get the eggs another time 😃
thanks againn
Alrighty :yes:
@PC I'm running shattered throne right now if anyone wants to join
just ran ST
> never again
?? why is that
the name of the triumph 😛
also running it for the first time was a bit tiring tbh
lots of tries on the last boss
"ah, lol"
and they're pretty stingy with ammo for some reason
I got some bad news for ya buddy
whats up?
You have to run shattered throne twice for wish ender. That's all. 😂
ohhh lol
Not to mention Toland's quest
"Oh y, but do you need to kill the last boss for the bow?"
no
Hey guys what's a good lore channel that puts up ton date videos?
I want to know about this week's oracle offering
Hey @Aberration are you joining us for last wish tonight?
"also, @Arixama , I think you said 6 cst is a bit early for you - what time is good for u?"
So optimistically I'll be home at 615 ish
I'm aiming for around 6:30 CST
"Okay sure, we'll try to start at 6:30 CST"
Coolio.
"And it looks like we might still be looking for one more, depending on whats going on with @Aberration"
Maybe @Mr.Kaeron ?
"Yeah, we'll see who is available."
Looking for what guys?
Last wish raid!
ahh
today? im gonna do some stuff with nat and tsushibi tonight
I'm still up in the air unfortunately. There's some family things that I have to attend to and I'm not entirely sure on how long it's gonna take. I'd say certainly fill my spot if you can but I'll so my best. Sorry I'm flaky on this one
"no worries, I understand"
"I work from 5-9EST tonight, otherwise I'd be in. Sorry guys and best of luck."
I'll be waiting in the Raid chat
btw we are gonna start a little later @Thawxtem !
ari and ron will be ready in about 40 minutes
"I read that earlier, but thanks. Just trying to set up a chat room early for communication purposes. Also lets me have a little slack from constantly checking the time"
"whisper catalyst done, got wish ender as well"
😄
Did you get the whisper ship along side the catalyst?
one more for last wish? @PC
yes I got the ship @Thawxtem  😄
Going to be slightly later than 630. Traffic is a bitch.
"ok, no worries"
Alright I'm coming online now
alright give me like 5 minutes to inhale this arby's and ill be good to go
Xur's up today- friendly reminder. Io
!lfg 753
@PC last wish?
My level is to low otherwise I would
@[NA] Eddielai2002
@Arixama @Thawxtem @TheCnC @Samakain
@Trissin Can you guys have one more in Gambit?
I can join
of course!
if you're still there @RonInDune
sorry I didnt see your message earlier
Oh yeah I'm there
"sorry, we just loaded in"
oh it's ok
I'll play a normal gmabit in the meanwhile
👍 we're finished @RonInDune
I'm joining hang on
we're just heading to tower
"So I think I have to bail on raid tonight, it's my brother's birthday and we're doing family dinner at 530"
"okay, np!"
"i might be able to do the raid, what time you guys going at?"
Around 6:30 to 7 central I think
i shoukd be around
"just installing a new OS on a new HD right now, should be done in plenty of time"
"I've also got my friend who couldn't join last night, he might join us tonight as well"
"I think we may as well just start fresh from kalli, it's better to learn a raid fresh than to learn halfway through"
Plus you can reinput the egg code for thawx
right true true
:juicebox:
Who else is doing last wish tonight? @PC ?
how much time does it usually take?
also my max power level i think is 567
THat's good enough!
You'll level up through the raid quite a bit I think
It takes a while
"This is weird. This emblem dropped after killing the Malfeasance boss, but then disappeared."
I can't even reacquire it from collections.
... looks like we don't have enough people to continue?
curious. Who is here/ready?
I am
@RonInDune ask bungie?
"If it's just us 3, I think I might drop out for now"
I have a few things I gotta do
"alright. I was thinking if it was 3, then maybe we could get dungeon rewards. or, if it was 4 we could go for Gambit Malfeasance"
I'm down for Shatter throne run
oh true
I really need a haircut though..... Lol
I think I'll head out for now and I'll be back later
real life comes first
"and we can go from there, if people are still interested in raiding or throne we can do that after"
@RonInDune check out the gambit emblem for an alternate on that emblem.
Similar to the location emblems?
"mango and I are looking to do shattered throne tonight, anybody else interested?"
i believe @RonInDune still needed to do it
Oh heck yeah I'm down
WHen are you planning?
Do you have the lore pieces already? I need to get those too
"We'll do it pretty soon, mango will be good to go within a half-hour I would say"
"and I dont have the lore pieces either, we can grab them"
"I completely forgot lol, thanks for reminding me"
"Alright I'm farming alkane dust right now, I'll be ready in 5 mins or so"
Alright I'm ready when you need me
i don't think mango is ready just yet
you should go ahead and do other activities for now I think
OK yeah I'll go have some dinner in the meanwhile

@RonInDune
anybody available to help ron and I with the last encounter of shattered throne?
"hey @Arixama , would you mind giving us a hand?"
yo @Trissin we missed like so many easy lore pieces.
We'd have to be ascendant for all/most of them though
oops
dont worry! we'll grab em next time
Did you do the mission for the wish ender? It's hard as heck
no I haven't done it yet
I've done it. It's more annoying than hard. It's doable
i believe the thunderlord is now out and available to be obtained 😮
i heard it takes you back to the cosmodrome!!!!!!
_memories_
Oh no I can't play the whole day and I'll have to wait.This is a great tragedy.
"dont worry ron, i wont be on till tomorrow either"
It's real fun.
I have a bunch of things to do this week.... DOESN'T MATTER THUNDERLORD.
Just got a Supremacy..... Was super hyped until Rapid Hit/Ambitious Assassin. FeelsBadMan
Is that the raid sniper?
"Yep, and it has nostalgia value for me because I used it all the time in D1Y1"
Looking for a Snapshot perk on it and anything else is a bonus
Oh too bad. I know of it only cause it gets referenced all the time in the lore
"GOD IT WAS SO GOOD OTHERWISE TOO. HANDLING MW, WITH HANDLING PERKS"
RNG WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME
RNGesus has not blessed you today
But I gotta say that the thunderlord totally shreds. Fantastic!
Looking for Iron Banana partners. All I'm doing tonight.
Hey so what are the odds of us trying Last Wish again this weekend?
I was actually going to bring that up as well
I'm free this entire weeekend
"Hey awesome, I'm pretty free this weekend as well"
I've also got a lot more experience now
and i've just about hit 600
@PC anybody interested in last wish this weekend?
sunday
i'd up for last wish sunday
"sunday, ok"
i've got a friend free on sunday as well
Traveling to TX for the week! No can do sorry fam
I can do evenings
"That makes 5 for at least Sunday, right?"
What was the really good hunter boot that @Trissin was looking for during the raid?
Orpheus rig probably
I dont recall looking for any boots during the raid
I think you were talking about them.
Oh I meant you said that they would be useful during the second bss
Orpheus rig makes sense
For people interested in running Last Wish tomorrow 👍
Yay I got my first Forsaken Hunter exotic!
:exotic_engram: :nkoWow:
Boo the exotic's utter shite
"""The Sixth Coyote"""
you doing anything important? level 400-something Titan still needs to do Forsaken story
just for company's sake
"I'm playing off and on, I have friends over, unfortunately ..."
You're fine. I was planning to wait until lvl 50 anyway
Trying to tempt them into getting the game
Sorry!
"If you have more than one, be sure to share those refer-a-friends :ScaryYoto:"
Anybody else interested in last wish tomorrow? @PC
"I'm also wondering if we can push this start time a bit earlier, perhaps around like 5 pm CT? (only if that works, just seeing what times are good for people)"
"I don’t leave work until around 5:30 CT, sorry"
what time for last wish?
Around 8 hours from now?
not sure if I can make it at that time
Could start as early as 7 hours from now but yeah
would be 1 am here 😂 not doable on a sunday
y I'd love to go
but got work tomorrow
Maybe we should do it earlier then?
So far only 3 people for the one tonight
"I'm not sure I would be able to go today anyway, so don't worry about me"
Well what time would you be free to do it today @naT ? Also @Mr.Kaeron and @Tsushibi if interested?
2 hours from now max
"alright, are there other people free ~ 2 hours from now, who are interested in doing last wish? no exp required @PC"
Oh yeah I'm down
It's just that I don't think we will have enough people for tonight. :c
@here so are people interested in doing Last Wish or no..?
"I am, in a strike right now"
there are actually enough people online right now to do it
"if we get @Mr.Kaeron, @Tsushibi , @naT , @Masrim"
I''m ready when you need me. Still grinding milestones to power up my hunter
People are just not online or not responding 😦
"Hey guys, not gonna do raid tonight"
Sorry bud im going to bed soon as well
"have fun, good luck"
"can't as well, sorry"
Ah well we'll try again next week I guess
"Also, I got my hunter to 600!"
2 Chars at 600 power
"Just the titan left now, which will be a challenge."
"So I know @Thawxtem and @RonInDune are down for last wish, anybody else?"
@here
"Heads up, just got home. Fixing to eat, but I’ll have discord up on my phone"
"Sure thing, but we don't have a team together. We're still missing 3"
Just saw earlier you said no one was responding
We might not be able to run it tonight
No shattered throne either this week
"Unfortunately I'm probably a no, working on some math atm and have an 8am class tomorrow morning, AKA ""Why did I decide that this timeslot was a good idea for a Monday?"""
loool thats ok
i guess we cant do it tonight
"If you have a character that needs exp later, I still need to run Forsaken campaign on my Titan"
@Oathbreaker 8 AM classes are the worst
"Oh this one isn't so bad, it's just I gotta get up early so I can drive to school. The actual class is enjoyable."
I taught (actually just TA-d) an 8 AM class and  it was not the best choice I've ever made
"Yeah..... really depends on if the class is okay. If it's one of those classes that are just dry and not really enjoyable, then it's hell. But IMO, if the class isn't really boring then I don't mind the 8AM start."
What was the place that you guys go to in order to find the occasional 6th? I was thinking about looking there to join a Leviathan
"Okay, despite the shit that Spectral Blades gets, it's actually an amazing super"
Gwisin Vest literally turns it into a Super that can last *over a minute long*
It's actually disgusting
I didn't get Spectral Blades with my 2nd seed of light and am now heavily regretting it. The new Arcstrider is really bad. I still can't use the melee at all.
I'll upload the video sometime over the next few days to show just how long it lasts. It's nuts.
"lol @RonInDune , i have actively been putting off the new arcstrider"
I have the seed of light but just dont even want to level it
also yeah @Oathbreaker gwising vest is pretty insane!!
"you get more energy after every time you heavy uppercut and stealth, dont you?"
Yeah that's the perk
Completely busted. I had a match where I was in super for a minute and 46 seconds. The only reason it didn't go longer was because the match *ended*.
"ok dumb question, but how do you stealth after wards?"
I think you activate stealth during spectral blades by using the uppercut heavy attack
Like right after the actual attack you just automatically stealth
"so right click, sadly I don't think I ever did that lol"
"so been playing with that vest, you get more energy for each kill before you stealth.  so kill 4 then uppercut and you get a lot more energy"
"Sorry, would have answered sooner. Bit of a rough night for me though. But yeah, heavy attack returns you to stealth. Also, there's a cadence to the regen. Listen to the sound cues, there's the first chime like noise then a second one about 2 seconds later. When that second chime goes off, you can heavy attack again to regen super energy."
Any time before that and you'll just waste the super energy.
"Will folks be available for another go at the raid this weekend? Doesn't have to be last wish, we can try any of the others or maybe even prestige."
"^
I would love to raid this weekend"
I still think we should go for last wish
"I have a pretty good understanding of what's going on now, and we just need the people for it"
Yeah I'm free almost all the time till Sunday. So whenever it's easy for people to match up...
"don't have calender beside me, but I can try"
If it's earlier in the day I may be able to get in on that finally
like what time? @Aberration
"Hey guys any suggestions on black Friday deals on Destiny type games? 

I'm looking for something with the same type of shooting really... 

I got the new Doom and it's somehow completely different."
"In my opinion at least, Destiny kind of has a unique feel to its guns and gunplay. If you like the loot and shoot genre, Borderlands would be a good place to start. I would love to recommend Titanfall 2, but it's been out for 2 years and its playerbase is dying slowly iirc. It's also a very high skill PvP game so... Another loot and shoot that comes to mind is Warframe, though it's not the best with explaining things and is a third person game."
"I don't know if there's a deal going on, but id look at the borderlands series. Gun plays will be slightly different, but there's the elemental gun types that affect different enemies, and there's the random roll aspect to the guns as well."
Welp
"I've tried Borderlands 2 but the humour in the starting area was so bad to me to me that I bounced right off.

Titanfall 2 seems to have great reviews and is $5 so I'll get that, thanks!"
Haha I might give that another go
"Well if you're not a fan of the humor in the first area, its pretty consistent throughout"
"That trash can robot, whose name I forget, was annoying. Is he there all throughout?"
"Yeah, Titanfall 2 is a really fun and insanely faced paced shooter... I'd highly recommend playing through the campaign first and try to get the movement systems down to a T. It's pretty much PvP only, but there is a PvE mode that's wave defense."
"Played it for a while, if you have any questions let me know. Would be more than happy to answer them."
Thanks guys! I'll get through the campaign and tell you what that was like.
"Claptrap, yeah he's pretty consistently there. Not as present as ghost, but fairly  present"
Aww well. I'll still give it a fair shake one more time.
"warframe is also i pretty unique one. third person shooter, and you dont really find guns, but you find mods that allowing to customize you weapon how you like. the crafting system is pretty good."
@Oathbreaker when was the last time you played warframe?
uhhhhhhhhh
A while ago?
Like right before Fortuna?
did you ever do the starter questline?
The Vor one? Yeah. I'm like 80% done Star Chart iirc
In the middle of Chains of Harrow I think
Oh man I joined warframe like 5 years ago and I have no idea what the game does anymore.
I apparently have 17 platinum whatever that means.
"i played way back when they didnt really explain a lot, and now that the switch version is out and ive been playing through the beginning it seems more explain-y as far as i remember."
"Damn according to steam I've last played Warframe on 8th May, 2014."
"Next Saturday, I’d like to make a group that will be farming the dungeon. This includes getting Wish Ender for those who don’t have it, getting the bones/eggs in the dungeon, as well as just clearing constantly for loot"
I’m free all day
I'm down
"^
me too"
@Trissin @RonInDune when are you open?
"If a second group forms I'd be in for Saturday, should be around. As for today - I think I should have time most of the day until about 9pm est if anyone would like to do anything"
I'm interested in going for last wish again today
Are people free for last wish today? @PC
"I am, yeah"
"There's half of a Fireteam, hopefully we can get 3 more today"
Count me in
"Is there anybody here at all interested in Last Wish activities? no experience is required, we just need 2 more for a full fireteam! @PC"
I’m working on getting my characters up and then I’ll be able to join in with you guys. Recently migrated from PS4
ohh i see npnp
Just hit 500. Now the grind begins
"Having dinner with family right now, but would anyone like to do the weekly DC quest before the raid group starts?"
we still need 2 more for the raid
We can finally invite people to fireteam without having to be friends with them
"Sorry for the absence guys, I'll be on after my exams next week. Just in time for Black Armory!"
@Trissin @RonInDune Are you guys still open for Dungeon farming on Saturday? When is a good time for you?
Oh heck yeah
I haven't started Destiny yet since the update though so I might eb a bit lost
Evenings maybe?
im ready for that wish ender
"Major season 5 doesn't start until next week, the only thing that changed this week are special s5 engrams for eververse and a 1 step eververse quest"
I still have to do the malfeasance trike
"Update did take a while for me, though"
I'm actually farming big taken for malfeasance
Yeah I downloaded it and then realized I really don't have time till the weekend
I'm also game for Shattered Throne should anyone else care to do it. I also want to run some EP today if anyone's around - taking a sick day
@RonInDune @Trissin I'll be on and ready at around 6-ish. going to a movie
"ALrgiht perfect, that'll give me enough time to log in and do some of the boutnies and stuff"
Just msg us when good! @Thawxtem
"@Trissin @RonInDune Launching Destiny, see you in a minute. I'll be in Fireteam - D2 - Alpha chat to make communication easier"
ALright I just started a strike I'll join you as soon as I'm done
anyone else looking to do Shattered Throne today?
@Aberration I can join you later on in the evening
Nice. Thanks - we'll see if timing lines up! I'm also looking to try and get EP Shotgun this week or next if anyones game
31 more Gambit matches to go for Breakneck 😛
get it!!!!! it's like the best PvE primary in the game
"Its a time commit for sure, so many gambit matches ;_;"
also hoping for meatball spawn
Hey @Thawxtem do you remember how you got the egg in the corrupted strike elevator area? I tried the strike a bunch of times last night and couldn't get it to spawn.?
"It falls down. You have to shoot it either when it's falling, or get lucky and have it land on the elevator. If it lands, it can still get knocked off, though."
Not so sure I'll be able to run the throne after all tonight. Is it super hard to solo it?
"It's not impossible, but pretty hard, yeah."
Anybody need the Corrupted Quest stage of Malfensence?
Darkness in Light step i mean
The strike?
"I believe @Thawxtem and @RonInDune are on that step, you might want to see if you can do it with them @Samakain"
Yup I am on that one.
Chaos reach with geo mags will eat about half the end bosses health
I actually got it done last night. Thanks though. If you guys still need some help drop me a line and i'll be happy too. 😃
How active is the PC side?
"Not as active recently, since it's seems a fair few have just finished up midterm a and are gearing up for finals, but there's still a decent amount of activity"
Activity will be a bit low this weekend but otherwise theres something going on every week!
I just got a gaming PC so I may do destiny on PC and playstation
Sweet spots seem to be 7 - midnight cst most days
Urgh I'm usually on in the am or after 11:30
I work swing shift
"Gotcha. I know that I do the ps4 and pc thing, but I'm way more active on pc."
Pc basically revitalized d2 for me. Picked it up in June or July  and was max power and had almost every exotic before forsaken dropped
Yeah im sure I won't have that much free time lol
Hey I'm an AM player usually - huzzah for more AM players
yaaaas @Nexeran joining us!!!!
"i just wrote two finals today, got more coming in the next couple of weeks so ill probably be less active"
but im definitely going to get on and play some black armory for now
you guys able to find groups that can complete the ignition?
I haven't gotten a decent group yet....
ive only tried it once and then realized i needed to get my light a little higher
but it didnt go great
"stephen and I are playing gambit, anyone else want to join us?"
I still need to work up the strength to drop more money to get d2 on PC : /
hahaha understandable 👌
"btw, what PC did you get?"
im curious
:))
I should clarify that I got a laptop not a pc
I got class tomorrow in the morning. Would join but I need sleep lol
https://www.bestbuy.com/site/alienware-17-3-laptop-intel-core-i7-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1070-256gb-solid-state-drive-1tb-hard-drive-black/6228319.p?skuId=6228319&ref=212&loc=1&extStoreId=221&gclsrc=aw.ds&ds_rl=1260666&ds_rl=1260576&ds_rl=1266837&ref=212&loc=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiA6JjgBRDbARIsANfu58GvIa4hCeTntanQJN1EPvN4o7tk4zkozbouVu9Yy1KUrqjjOeYcZSIaApJ1EALw_wcB
np @Oathbreaker
ooooooooh @Nexeran that looks juicy
dammnnnn
I'm told it should run d2 no problem
But I'm not that kind of IT to know PC specs
with those specs it better
haha i think that will definitely run D2 no problemo
lmaoo
Haha sweet
It came with a free copy of blops 4
ooh nice
im pretty sure those specs are similar to mine so you should do great
Oh yeah I have laptop with a  1060 and it runs beautifully. Great machine!
ooh hit me up if you ever want trash on your team
Lol well I may take you up on that lol
My BN is Nexeran#1924 if anyone wants to add me
You peeps quick lmao
The thing I'm not looking forward to is starting over in d2
"honestly, it goes pretty fast"
at least it did in warmind
Well If your good I'm sure. I haven't done PC gaming in years lol
i played mostly on a controller until whisper came out.
Oh yeah I can connect a controller!
I'm stupid!
"it was what i was most used to for destiny, so it helped the transition"
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47501
The power requirement for the forge has been lowered by 5
I didn't even get the annual pass. I barely get to raid due to my schedule so it didn't really seem worth the price of admission
PS geomags are awesome
Geomags are indeed awesome!
has any1 done the forge quest yet?
"With the launch of the new raid today all raid discussions will be kept in #deleted-channel so mute it if you dont want spoilers.   Failure to keep discussion and spoilers will result in a server mute, if you spot this please message an admin (goal, nex, cuppie, jerky, lizard or myself) so we can remove the spoiler, have a good weekend and good luck if you attempt. -admins"
"for anyone @here who may not have the complete version of destiny, Blizzard has it on sale for 40% from dec 6 - 10"
"In other words, I just bought d2 on PC! Yay me!"
!!! 👍
:travelergoogly:
Still gotta play 17 more matches of gambit
#ForeverGambit
Which auto are you using?
"I used halfdan-d with outlaw/kill clip. Good range, made it easier"
"managed to pick up a seething heart, if anyone wants to run The Corrupted today for the quest step I'm game"
OH yeah I'm down
let me know when
"If it’s around 6 or later cst, could I join?"
Sure. Could try to organize it for later tonight
"im not 100% on it, but I can try for around 8ish CST"
my luck continues! finally got the ikelos sg
what a day
nice!!!!! 👍 @Aberration
Oh damn the ikelos weapons are what I'm missing to get the wayferer seal
@RonInDune youve got the osprey?
Yeah I should have clarified
I don't have most of the Mars weapons
ooh I need the osprey too
YOU get that from the nightfall right?
I haven't done a nightfall in ages
"I think nightfall weapons are much easier to farm now, as opposed to before"
Hmm maybe we can do some today
I definitely need to do that
you guys want to farm the nightfall?
"cool, when are you free @RonInDune"
A couple of hours from now
From 6:30 CST or so
"alright, we'll see if @Arixama can join us then, or what times work for him as well"
That definitely works for me.
alright im good to go 👍 @RonInDune @Arixama
Hey guys sorry I was in a strike I'm joining up now
we're in voice as well
@RonInDune @Aberration I'll be in Fortnite Chat when you guys are ready for Malfesance
"depending on time, may not be able to run tonight after all"
my mornings are super early even on weekends
WE can start now if you want!
"Maybe if we had a 3rd, even just to go along with us. When I did it for Helatia, yes we were lower light, but all 3 people there were very helpful"
Trissin can join in with us!
@Aberration do you need to do the corrupted strike for malfeasance?
yeah I dont have super long tho
how long do you have?
"I think with Ron and Thawxtem you should be okay, it won't take too long"
@Aberration
"we can try it out, if its just the regular strike itll be like 10-15 mmin"
It has a different sort of final boss
im right at the flag to start it up
voice chat? @Aberration
yep - mic is off but i can listen
thx for the help all
"No worries man, good luck farming!"
@Trissin you still farming?
for the osprey? sure thing
do we have a 3rd?
"i didn't have anyone in mind, I just know that I haven't recieved a nightfall weapon yet"
ever
is ron online?
Yeah but i'll be off and on
Sorry
"oh, okay"
I think we're going to want a 3rd if we're farming
im still waiting for destiny to install T.T
but only 11 gigs to go!
anyone @here  want to do the refer-a-friend thing? i havent even started the game on battle.net yet
@Nexeran dibs
alright
Haha ^
send me the invite @Arixama
Man no hesitation from Ari lmao
https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/ReferAFriend?code=RAF-XJT-LM6-6AG
There's my thing
"ok, i think i need to sign in first"
Are you going to do the 30 boost?
yes i am
is there a time limit on the quest chain for the refer?
I don't believe so
600 MB left!
can i use a controller if i suck with keyboard and mouse? lol
i think if you get used to the keyboard and mouse
you'll appreciate the precision'
that it offers over the controller
😉
"oh know i agree with that, just may be a bit rusty for a while"
"I think if you're doing PvP a lot, KB+M will be a huge advantage"
"I got called away for family stuff so if someone else wants to run through it with you, they can go for it"
so your giving up dibs? or just telling me to wait for you?
I'm giving up dibs 🤣
dibs
lol alright then
well ill need a new refer then soon
https://www.bungie.net/en/Profile/ReferAFriend?code=RAF-AAC-663-6MY
i think this is it?
Should be
"yeah that looks right, im just gonna make my character  soon"
alrighttttt 👍
what class are you gonna pick? 🤔
titan
also i think i need to join the clan on pc
sure thing
hmm says im already a member
"yeah, i see you on our list"
just got my super back
woohoo
i think that means i can join up on ya now?
i think so
i see other players
"yep, im just flying in now"
sweetr
did you find it?
"On my way home, if youre still doing stuff"
@Trissin  you online?
im here
you availablefor 3 public events?
"yep, ill log on"
@Trissin you on?
"hey, im actually about to head out for dinner kinda soon"
ill be back afterwards
^^^bot
the player?
"""player"""
he is doing a left steo then a right step then a shot
on reapeat
that sucks
you able to get on for 3 crucible matches?
"man, bad times - had a game I was playing corrupt my system32 somehow"
"bricked my pc, had to format my ssd and go through all this crap just to get back"
Oh damn
Which game as it?
magic the gathering arena
#betaproblems
"got lucky today tho, phoenix protocol dropped off a dawning powerful bounty and then I got breakneck and finished the motes step of malfeasance"
NIce!
I'm stuck on around 70% for malfeasance
My issue is that it seems like nobody sticks together in gambit unless you're running it with people.
"Half the time I lose motes is cause nobody is clearing blockers with me, and the other half is people just running off once they get some motes to bank and not clearing mobs"
Yeah its tough for sure. I usually sit back first round and just clear adds and watch how other people react
"if other people are running around like idiots i usually just go small blockers, but if there are other add clearers ill go in for med/lg blockers"
most often ill just spam small blockers tho because every time I get greedy I get invaded by a queenbreaker dredgen
"I try to do my gambit clears at the end of the week, when people who love the mode are still playing and not those who are just clearing the required matches for the powerful drop."
That's a valid point. I play a lot of mornings and it seems like skill is lower during the off times
Easymode activate?
its kind of a bummer that exotic weapons are really limited to the heavy slot for viability
got this fancy malfeasance that I'll probably never use
Pulled queenbreaker yesterday from a crucible rank up. It seems very good.
ah man I'm jelly
"Apparently it's ungodly in gambit, but I haven't tried it yet."
It's disgusting in any PvP mode
"Aim in the general direction of someone and pull that trigger, it'll be a headshot"
*Slight* exaggeration but it lands headshots that should be misses or bodyshots.
Anybody need that insight terminus step for the forge activation?
Anybody interested in Last Wish tonight?
No exp. necessary
Hmm I might
But I'll be late# around 8:30 or so
Central
thats fine
Anybody else for last wish tonight? We can start in about 1 or 2 hours @here
Probably
If im about
running shattered throne now for the eggs
okay 👍
I can bring warlock or titan
Warlock /hunter from me
"i can bring any, littlepants is going to bring his hunter"
"RIP, littlepants is going to need a while"
like a long while
Are you guys close to or at 650 yet?
im not even 640
I'm at 638
last wish in like 10 minutes? @PC
Fuck I'm out to dinner now
any idea how long?
LittlePants and I are ready
hey I'll be available in about 15~20 min
I have no idea
"what about @RonInDune and @Mr.Kaeron , when are you guys free?"
probably gonna join u aswell
let us know when you're good @naT !
10 mins and we're done @Trissin

@Mr.Kaeron @naT

Almost finished actually.
oh ok perfect
ok ready
ready as well
ok
we're just waiting on ari
are we all going voice?
im home
@Mr.Kaeron @naT check your friend requests on discord
accepted
It looks like ron needs 15 - 20 more minutes
maybe we'll do some escalation protocol while we wait?
@naT @Mr.Kaeron
nah im good
"okay, we'll regroup when ron is ready then"
I'm gonna go grab a bite in the meantime
are we starting soon? im getting sleepy af
woop
sorry yesterday guys
was really tired
we can try and do some today
All good! No need to apologize
Tried to solo shattered throne
"First part, not so bad once you figure it out. Second part...kinda annoying with the crappy platforming across tiny bridges with taken ogres blasting you around. Third part EZ."
... my commiserations
Vorgeth...managed to get to one actual DPS phase
got him down about 25% and then the wizards reset
immediately exit the game
question why I did that to myself
@Trissin are we doing lw today?
"I would like to, I know @Arixama is busy, wondering if @RonInDune and @naT are available?"
I;m available from now onw...
anyone need to run shattered throne for wishender? I sure do
I do Aberration!
any1 for nf daily?
@Samakain I have a little time right now if you'd like to try it.
I could also bust out a nightfall real quick @Mr.Kaeron
let me finish this forge
I'll be on in a min no worries
I actually completely forgot that I was going to whip up a batch of cinnamon rolls this morning. Gotta make the dough so I need to raincheck for a little. Maybe 10-15?
"Hey guys, I'm gonna be running one of my friends through regular leviathan soon (around 15 minutes from now), anybody interested in joining?"
Oh no I just left the house. Dang it!
noooo haha
maybe we can wait for you!
any idea how long you'll be out?
Nah we're going for a Christmas party. Good luck on the run! Don't forget the contenders she'll!
"will do, thanks! have fun at your party 👍"
anybody for leviathan then? @PC
not today I work tomorrow
"would you guys be interested in doing a quick raid or something tonight, @RonInDune @Samakain ? (maybe something short like eater of worlds)"
if not its all good
"Hmm I don't think so, sorry! I can't be there consistently..."
haha no worries at all
I'd love to normally but i gotta go into work in like half an hour
Sorry I couldn't raid tonight! But I did get Malfeasance done finally!
still need motes here
I played super conservative for that step
Kept dumping 3s and 4s
Wanted to do more raids but the timezone difference is quite problem for us in Portugal
Had black talon and cerberus drop yesterday
Got dang man!
still waiting on QBB...do want
Does anyone have any tips to get the mote thief emblem in gambit?
"I'm completely lost, never even get close to picking the 3 motes"
Which one is that?
Is it required for dredgen?
It's the one where you have to collect 3 mores while invading
It's the last piece of lore that I haven't collected
Ohh
Not sure if I've done that
But I think I have
What class you rockin?
Warlock mostly
The only class I don't play as xD
Haha I play warlock cause Chaos reach metls the boss
"Take good invasion weps, get targets near mobs. Get shit from em"
Y I do premade with 2 locks
It's amazing
"Yeah I though I'd never have to invade again after getting malfeasance, but then this one came out lol"
Good call that!
"Bad omens iz good, thunderlord as well"
Ahahahaha
U need abit of luck as well
True true
I'll check if I have it when I get home
If I do
Probably ran that with code of the missile
Hmm
My titan hasn't even completed forsaken yet sadly.
"Skullfort helm. Malfeasance, trust, bad omens. What what I was using"
That's a nice combo
I'll have to try it
Well I was focusing on finishing dredgen at the time
If done well u get super twice per round
YOu have Dredgen! Dang dude
"Yis, spammed alot of gambit. Was just missing that third reset"
Great freaking work
Light versus light is the most annoying 1. But it's doable. Just gotta be patient
"also unrelated, saturday would be a cool day to run Last wish if you guys are up for it"
"@RonInDune just checked I have it, if you wanna try that with hunter or titan I can give you what I think would be good loadouts, if u play warlock I dont have much input since its the only class I dont play."
"I main warlock. Generally run chaos reach with geomags. I have been using breakneck/go figure/midnight coup primary, ikelos shotgun and thunderlord for weapons. Thunderlord shreds Invaders and while invading. Ikelos sg and chaos reach let's you pretty much solo the primeval"
I have yet to get any of the meatball drops for dredgen yet...boohoo rng
OK the Izanami forge unlock nightfall is super duper hard. I keep dying to the shield bashes and getting kicked to orbit
"Finally made it to 650, this was such a slow grind."
Seems like you got a solid setup there. Just a matter of keeping at it. Bound to get it eventually
anyone for gambit?
anyone for Nightfall?
I finally had the grimoire delivered! It sold out almost instantly the first time around ...
"😮 nice!!! i was going to order one as well, but it sold out 😦"
"check amazon, saw it on there"
"oooh, will do, thanks!@"
i picked up the collectors edition of d2 for ps4 for 50 bucks.
the one that comes with the messenger bag
"ohhhh that's really nice, how is it???"
"it comes on tuesday, so we'll see then"
Anyone up for helping with a 270 arms dealer nightfall?
So is anyone trying the niobe labs unlocking quest?
I'm hearing it's bit of a wild goose chase
haha i dont think it's been cleared yet
Feel like it's harder than the raids at this point
"It's not really harder, it just that people are super overthinking things."
"like the tree thing, lol"
The level 6?
I was watching that last night when everyone was going crazy with it
Like trying almost random dictionary words
"im really surprised how far the community got though, some of those are so difficult to find"
poems and gems and swords and all
It's honestly pretty cool. Did bungie do anything similar in D1?
its not fully unlocked yet right?
"I'm watching a stream passively, and I don't think so"
"I think the lesson bungie should take away is that maybe they need to make more complicated puzzles, since people are going super in depth"
If they actually try to do something like this in the future
ronin can u gimme the link to the stream?
http://www.twitch.tv/xgladd this is one of them.
https://www.twitch.tv/teawrex is the other
Oh he's back up now? Cool
ty
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1083096220485054464
Doesn't matter who's racing for it now because it's just gonna get unlocked anyways
Aww that's a shame
These fan hunts are really cool
The problem is that there's a quest tied to the Forge the one of the steps is doing shattered throne
"Yeah, and it's been 29 hours since release, no dice. Cool as it is, it's not something that Bungie wanted to be THIS long."
Is anybody interested in doing leviathan? I'd like to run a friend through it 😃
"currently a group of 3, so 3 more?"
if interested
I need to kill some watchers to do the exotic quest
Plus I'm missing some kills for the levi exotic shotgun quest
great! 2 more?
if you are still looking for people for levi in about 4 hours ill probably be around
ok!
actually @Gimmie2 we are gonig to see if we can do it now
sorry!
2 more for normal leviathan? @PC ??
"no worries man, best of luck"
Oh welp I won't be available for atleast another hour
noo!
"Trying to unlock 2nd forge, but I might be able to help in a little while"
"I can come in as early as 45 mins, depending on traffic"
okay!
will you be free then @Thawxtem ?
Probably.
are people ready?
Hey I'm just getting back in
Give me a couple of minutes to log in
take your time!
Just got here. Could we go ahead and land on Leviathan so that we aren't all waiting for me to load?
I think we need one more person
littlepants will also be back soon
"For anyone interested, I'll be in Raid chat"
Can we get 1 more for leviathan? @PC
Give me a couple of minutes and I'll get on Trissin @Trissin
@PC 1 more for eater of worlds starting in about 15 minutes?
I gotchu
Alright I'll be back in 5
I assume raid is done already lol
"Yeah we did a couple of runs, I'm sure we'll do some more in the future!"
U guys always run raid when I'm sleeping 😔
Hey anyone wants to try niobe's torment either late tonight or tomorrow?
Is anybody interested in Last Wish today?
What time are you looking at?
I can;t come in before 8 or so
Not sure! Depends when people are free
before 8 cst?
"Okay, will keep that in mind"
"Yeah I'll be driving back from Houston from around 6, so earliest probably for me is around 7:30 CST"
why always on a sunday -_-
a lot of us are free on sunday!
"classes throughout the week, work and other things on saturday"
If I can get my math done quickly I might be able to sneak in a raid tonight.
Damn calculus.
@Oathbreaker pretend you're a 15 th century mathematician and refuse to do any calculus on principle
LMFAO I wish
"@Trissin @RonInDune @Oathbreaker Just got on, is Last Wish still a possibility?"
Let me know when you guys are good to go @Thawxtem @Oathbreaker @RonInDune
Gonna be iffy for me
will we be in Raid - Alpha or making our own call?
This is some annoying work that's due tomorrow
I'll see if I can really push hard but no promises
making a call i think
all good oath
"I'm ready whenevs, just let me know because I'm leveling underused titan"
Will need to switch back to someone who can actually complete the raid
Keep us updated if youre good @RonInDune !
I'm free as well if you guys need a set of boots.
great!!
"I'm really sorry, I'll be up in 15 or so minutes"
np!
"@Oathbreaker any idea if you'll be good to go by then? If not don't worry about it, you should focus on your work"
I believe we have 7atm with Sam
"Likely not, this is a little rough. Maybe half hour if you guys still need me."
Apologies guys. Thought this would be a little quicker
"Np! No need to apologize, it's all good"
I'm coming on now
any possibility of getting help with the final encounter of shattered throne?
@Trissin Yeah if you can group up without me go for it. Still gotta write the online test for this.
"I think i could give you a quick hand with it, just before we start our raid @Arixama"
"Don't want to keep you guys waiting, and if you've got 7 I'm more than willing to be the one who steps out!"
"okay, good luck with your work!"
youre okay filling in for oath @Samakain ?
"Sure, still a bit green on the raid as i've only done the first two encounters before. Hope that's not problem?"
"nope, all good!"
one of my friends is completely new to the raid
"Great, just gunna grab a drink and i'm good to go"
👍 and you did great last time as well
Thanks!
anybody up for helping with the pyramidion step of izanagi?
Littlepants and I can join
"Another week, still no Transversive Steps FeelsBadMan"
"Hey all, anyone down for trying a raid tonight or tomorrow?"
Maybe Scourge if someone know how that works?
"I don't think I'm free tonight or tomorrow, sorry!!"
But I'd definitely love to do scourge sometime
"All good! I agree, maybe next week for scourge?"
"Give me some warning and yeah for sure, got some leave coming up and that'd be fun."
"(Also, Jötunn dropped for me! whoooo!)"
"We can start organizing a group for scourge this weekend - when are people free, and what times work best?"
"For me, fri/sat night + sunday afternoon are ideal"
Sat night and Sunday afternoon/evening god for me
"Gonna try to solo Kalli today I think, or at least learn it. Anyone wants to stop by and watch me likely fail, just @ me and I'll give you a link to my twitch."
Oh dang I'm down
Sent the link ron
gat dang Bungie is trolling me
Had an exotic drop on completion of Bergusia forge : turns out it was yet another tractor canon
"Then used the armour forging consumable, dropped me second pair of gloves"
I had a guy get his second jotunn drop
Do we have enough people to try Scourge tonight?
I'm interested!
"Time is not constant, we can push the start time around"
Join if interested @PC !
Still haven't completed last wish 😂😂
Timing works for me. Get home from work at 9pm EST.
Anybody here got division on pc?
The first one? I do yeah.
Also got a spare key from this month's humble bundle.
"Yeah, I've got the humble bundle key, so I was thinking of giving it another go. Tried it on Ps4 when they did the beta or whatever it was, and it was pretty fun there."
Just didn't compete enough with other games at the time for me to pull the trigger on it
I remember they had an absolutely fantastic trailer. The game didn't quite live up to that hype.
It also came out around the same. Time. As Witcher 3 I think
Oh no
@danny
Join the scourge event
1 more for Scourge tonight? @PC
"I also have Division on PC, though I played the absolute hell of out it for a while. My main character is basically min/maxed"
Also just got home so give me all of like 2 minutes to get myself situated
np! 👍
Any preferences on class I bring in?
3 warlocks would be nice
i know ari and ron are warlocks
and after warlocks we want hunters
"I don't have Well, but if someone gives me a bit I can run through Dreaming City unlock mission and grind out a T2 Blind Well"
"i think that's fine, we're still looking for a 6th"
Anybody know the fastest way to level up?
Bribe bungie
Spider bounties work well
"If bribes worked, I wouldn't need to level 😂 I'd just have a new face"
Wanted bounties?
lol does anybody have anyone for scourge?
Nope lol
Neither do I
"okay so how about this, Littlepants and I have a friend who is ready for last wish but not high enough light for Scourge"
"Littlepants suggested we do last wish first, so he can get some gear to increase his light, and then we can do scourge"
Yeah I'm fine with that!
Personally I'd be alright with that
Any chance of us trying Scourge or any other raid tonight?
I think we can complete Scourge today
im good pretty much whenever.
As am I
"Likely can't join. Have an AutoCAD project due tonight, math quizzes due tomorrow, more AutoCAD, and more but I won't bore you guys with all that"
I'll see what I can do though
"okay, let us know!!"
im free pretty much anytime today and til about 7ish tomorrow
Finally got Jotunn. Wasn't as grindy as I though it would be honestly.
It's got a decently high drop rate if I remember correctly.
Yeah I got it on my 5th powerful frame.
No raid tonight for me unfortunately
Anybody up for Whisper?
sorry I just saw this! LittlePants and I can help you for sure 👍
Wait today's Tuesday. Is whisper still up?
it got changed!
join fireteam! @Samakain
really? dang! I wish they'd do the same for the Shattered Throne then
Sorry! here now!
quick join up
event ends soon
you have like 10 seconds to join fireteam
loading
its okay you loaded in
i clicked start
Got crucible part of last word done in 2 games lol
Dang dude
Did you get 50 kills each or what?
Uh no
About 20 each
Then assists
I also just play my life
Interesting
"Yeah, 22 and 23 kills, with 3 and 5 assists"
Is there like streak bonus?
Maybe?
I went on 2 10 streaks
Anyone down for a Shatter Thrones run?
I need my Izanagi's
!loadout primary
Congrats dude!
lol ty !
Seems like it's not too hard to grind out?
"no, it's quite fast actually"
I went up 30%  in the 2nd step then completely lost the plot and am down to 10% now. It'l be a long wait for me ...
oh no!
Is that defeats in crucible?
"Yeah your KDA matters, has to be atleast above 0.5"
"It's pretty much the same as motes for malfeasance, right?"
"similar yeah, but I found this one to be faster than the motes"
"If I werent 20 hours deep in kh3, I'd be working on that. 😂"
Gotta do the Crucible medals part before the last mission
Then I get it
There we go.
Man the last couple of crucible games I played last night were full of players with last word/not forgotten/lunas.
Not very fun for someone as bad as me...
"Ron, you want to group up for a bit? We'll see if I can't try and help get you through this if you want"
Are you free Friday evening onwards? I'm not sure I can log in till then...
Friday evening maybe. Let me check my work schedule. Hopefully don't work then
Yeah I'm good
"That offer also stands for anyone who wants a partner for this, by the way"
TY TY!
"So I'll give my quick thoughts about the weapon: It's fun, it's real useful for shutting down rushes, but Ace can do just about everything The Last Word can, while having the most Hand Cannon range out of all viable options"
"The one thing I like most about it though, is the hip-fire is useable"
Last game I played I was able to hipfire down a charging Spectral Blade when he was weak
Hitting 51 to the body standard allows for some real nice cleanups
"So, after some really anecdotal evidence gathering, Ari and I have come to the conclusion that playing with someone who has a higher skill rating than you is extremely detrimental as the matchmaking likes to throw higher skilled players together. The matchmaking has little or  no regards to what team they're on, leading to some very one sided matches. As an example, we played a game on Retribution where I was the only diamond rated player (going off of DestinyTracker's ratings) on our team, with two or three diamond level players on the opposing team. He was at 1% after 3 matches. I left, he goes up to 12% in one match."
Do you know if scouts are viable now? It's a bit cheesy but it allows me to camp and rack up some points far without needing to be good enough with a sniper
Also did Whisper always one tap bodyshot in the crucible?
Scouts are eh right now still. Jade Rabbit works on some maps and some sight lines but others not so much
Also Whisper shouldn't be one shot bodying in the crucible unless they're standing in an Empowering Rift or Well of Radiance so no
Ahh I probably was in a rift then
"I like to use scouts, Polaris Lance is my go to"
"If my exotic is taken I'll just use the legendary version, the braytech one"
"Yeah, scouts can be good, but I just don't do well with them lol."
"It's a big preference thing, but it also depends on the map"
I can't run them on certain maps
For sure. Equinox (the big open Nine focused one) is one I could run scouts or pulses on for sure.
I loooove equinox lol
Oh man Equinox is the prettiest map. I wish I could just explore that one
I don't like it. I may be a sniper but there's no good angles. Only wide open spaces that allow for anyone to tag me with any damage and then massive amounts of flinch get involved.
What's the lore behind that map? Where did it come from and why is it all white?
"No clue, I don't think any of the Nine maps have been explained"
When will trials be back again? Last time they were on I wasn't in a clan and never got to try it out...
Good question that no one knows the answers to
"^
Trials should come back"
It honestly should
No gimmicks
Just Trials
Also Rallies! I want my gravaton lance catalyst already.
So I'm pretty sure I just got MOTW emblem.... Helped the runner up get some footage for the cinematic shots and DMG is asking if the list is complete and whatnot
lens of fate??
nice!!!!
Don't have it in my inventory just yet but TWAB came out like an hour and a bit ago
"yeah, I saw"
congrats! lol
Thank you!
Damn dude congrats!
Congrats Oath!
https://youtu.be/8t65PmubWQk
Also proud of this match
Is it supposed to be muted?
Yeah the audio is quiet for some reason
Wait
It's gone completely?
Oh boy.
Yeah'
Troubleshooting time.
Think I've got the reason.
Oh man those sniper headshots are fine
"Yeah I know why, it'll be fixed for anything done next time"
Can't re-upload because main file is having the same issue so.... RIP.
That's a fantastic match damn
Hey do you guys know if the Fastidious Miser triumph for ascnedant chests in the dreaming city is still bugged?
I just did all the chests and it still didn't open
RIP dude
Super annoying
"Also, anyone down for a Shattered Throne run?"
Still need the Izanagai's...
Welp I just got it after returning to orbit
Anybody up for shattered throne?
Yes!
I just tried soloing for the last 45 mins and got nowhere
Yeah I did that a day ago and it was awful
i'm hunting eggs and bones in there so i hope you don't mind some jumping around?
Oh no worries
Dow have 1 more?
"I'm just by myself, we should be ok with 2 but if someone wants that spot that'd be great"
Hm let me try once
@PC Anyone down for a shattered throne run?
"sorry I just saw this! I can help, sure"
"@Trissin Oh we finished it a bit ago, thanks though!"
"If you're still up, I wouldn't mind some help with the Izanagi's quest steps"
Yeah! What steps are you on?
THe pyramidion
"oh, yeah i can help if you need"
although I think we might need a 3rd
Hmm let's see
Well I'm ready whenever. Let's see if anyone else can drop in
maybe sam?
OK I'll ask @Samakain
But I think he said he would be busy
ohh
I got what I needed to done
and I can jump in a nightfall if ya like @RonInDune
Perfect thanks!
"Good to go, send me an invite when you're ready"
Come to realise that while i dislike the crucible. I very much enjoy Shaxx calling me a good boy
Has anybody checked out anthem yet?
Not me. Trying super hard to not spoil myself! Pre ordered and waiting.
I believe @Trissin might have?
"I played some of the first demo, but it was decently buggy. I think they've got another one coming up? And I'm hoping it'll be a bit more polished up."
How much of the story is in it?
"I'm not super sure. It was mostly out of context anyway, but I'd guess that it's probably pretty early on if anything."
"I'd guess it's kind of the way they did Andromeda, where you got to basically play the starting mission, and a good chunk of the first part of the first planet, but it's meant as more of a beta than a sneak peek."
"That's good. I'm not expecting Destiny levels of gameplay out of it, but as long as I get some Bioware levels of story."
And pretty landscape to take screen shots of
There's definitely pretty landscapes. And I really enjoyed the combat.
The only thing that was a little weird to me was the way the flight controlled
Open beta ended yesterday unfortunately
I'll be honest I wasn't super impressed but it is still a cool game
"And to be completely fair, we didn't exactly get to endgame levels of gear and the fun that could bring"
"I know people who did the vip demo, got access to four suits."
"Yeah. I tried 3 out of the 4, wasn't super interested in Colossus. Interceptor was... Weird but okay? Kinda fun but wasn't too useful team wise. Ranger just felt like your stereotypical FPS kind of class. Storm was definitely fun and very useful."
So uh
Apparently there's 7 Nightfalls currently
Is strange terrain one?
Which I need to farm
_someone say **strange terrain**?_
"Yep, back to 3 strikes though"
"that's okay, is strange terrain still a nightfall for this week?"
"Yes, warden of nothing, pyramid ion and strange terrain I believe"
OH yeah I need Strange Terrain for the wayfarer weapon
ospreyyyyyyyyyy
I also need the corrupted nightfall weapon for cursebreaker
"oh btw yes, I did get to play the anthem demo as well, I did try the colossus"
Anthem felt a **lot** like warframe
and less like destiny
Is that the pulse rifle? Horror's Least?
Is that nightfall bug still working?
but i havent checked
"Aww well, since I'm 650 it won't be too hard to solo"
"I would recommend you farm it with a group, you'll probably need a few completions before it drops"
True True
Well that's what I'll be doing this weekend then
Movie of the Week Emblem. Hell. Yes.
Congratulations man!
Thank you! Proud to be a part of something that won it.
"Next up, winner of a world's first race!"
"LOL, I wish"
Anybody up for a NF?
"Press F to pay respects for Titan Skating everyone, getting worked on later this month"
**NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**
Hahahaha
Scroll wheel skating might still work
They're trying to target the macros specifically
"Also they're mentioning that you can still skate, but tuned down to a much more manageable speed"
>:c
=f
"Well nobody liked Titans anyway, so no big loss! 😋 😋"
"yeah, i deleted a titan for another warlock. :rip:"
Warlocks rule! Titans drool!
_*banned_
:uldren:
"Hey clan, Hawthorne wanted me to say hi!"
"Would anyone be interested in getting some time in the crucible for learning? Nomad, the guy who got me better at PvP is currently gauging interest on a sherpa session sometime soon, either next week or another time. What would likely happen is he plays some matches with you, finds any faults you have, gives you an explanation of the faults and what to do to work on them, and then you would play a few more matches. If anyone has any questions or is interested, DM or @ me and I can explain further. I did one of these back in late September with Nomad, and have played a hell of a lot of games with him since then while improving, so I do have some experience to this."
"He also just put out a video in his ""Crucible Doctor"" series on Youtube about how to shut down shotguns. Would be more than willing to post a link to the video."
Would anyone be willing to run a 2 person nightfall with me for Crimson Days/ Clan bounty?
Hey @Thawxtem I'm down for that tonight and tomorrow night onwards!
Huh apparently you can 2 man the first part of the Scourge raid in like a minute
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU7lNqlbK48&feature=youtu.be
We have to try it soon!
"OK, so since it's technically anthem pc release day (conditions apply) I wanted to see who @here has plans to pick it up in some capacity, whether that's buying the game or paying for origin access premier?"
I have it and it's preloading
"i don't have premiere, so I don't think I can play it until next week"
"Yeah, it's a bit silly really."
"I've seen games do like a couple days early for pre-ordering the deluxe edition, but a full week for their subscription service is kinda ridiculous"
"1. Waiting on general feedback before making the decision.
2. Pretty sure you can do the Origin Access premier trial for it but I could be wrong"
"Ea access premier has a 10 hour demo on xbox, origin access has the full game"
Hey so are you guys free for some Crimson days stuff this weekend?
I know @Thawxtem wanted i couple of days back t but I didn't have time...
ANyone @PC  down for a quick nightfall ? Really wanna get the final crimson days item...
Give me a minute and I can log in
Oh thanks so much!
"No mic for me though, late here and people are trying to sleep"
Will of the Thousands with solar/heavyweight sound good?
Just need to complete the nightfall
Logging in right now
Is anyone down for a couple of shatter throne runs today or tomorrow? I have ada-1 bounty that needs it...
Oh man the reckoning looks so beautiful damn!
Finally something to do with the Nine that's not solely PvP
yesss haha
The glowing armour sets look like the ones we had in the event before Forsaken  dropped
"yeah, solstice of heroes"
Yup that
Also Season of Opulence! We're going back to the Leviathan I feel like.
yes!! that will be really fun
im more excited for that one haha
i really like the calus theme and stuff
Reddit was saying people were SRL merch so that might be a surprise waiting for us
ooooooh interesting!
thats a good observation
I forgot there was no raid this season
"Opulence is definitely going back to leviathan, the penumbra teases when they were first talking about  the annual pass had multiple leviathan set pieces."
I thing reckoning is supposed to be the raid-like activity
Maybe like a shattered throne type but with the timer from the Halloween activity
There's a power increase too right?
Yup. 700 I believe
I'm excited for the allegiance quest
What's that?
that's not thorn is it
how could one possibly be excited for thorn
What's Thorn like?
death
I think it's separate. You get to choose between vanguard and drifter alliance on your characters
The pic looks like Malfeasance and that's no very nice
oooooh interesting
I wonder if I can play both sides with different characters
Lore wise thorn is one of the weapons that would straight up kill guardians in the crucible
also not lore wise
because it does straight up kill guardians in the crucible
"It's character based and not account based, so it would seem so"
"Nah, that would require it to uninstall the game and delete your account"
Oh yeah the gun used by shin Dredgen Yor
Damn I should try to get Dredgen this week to prepare then
this week is the week to do it
"Yeah I need one more reset, 6 light vs light kills, and 1 more invasion team wipe"
I'll be grinding this weekend
oh im also stuck on light vs light lol
glad it was made easier 😃
"or, wait, no, it's going to be easier starting next week"
I once messaged a guy to ask him to invade and pop super so I could try to kill him as I was the only one in my team for some reason and didn't want to quit
did he do it?
"He agreed, so that's how I got 4 kills"
Nice dude
ohhhh what that's so nice!!!
nobody invades with super anymore....
Exactly!
"I'm currently in pvp hell, so I'd be willing to do some gambit at somepoint. 🤣😭"
i see you've been grinding some competitive
how is it?
Comp is weird though I was matchmade with an entire team of 150 light players with green weapons
It;s kinda broken
It doesn't reset my Valor winstreak and I'm making progress on Lunas sort of
Ooh nice
lol that's good
I got my first hatemail when I was using contraverse holds in comp
Now with last word out it doesn't help all that much
Unfortunately the sweats are all back in quick play and rumble so I cant get my win streak back up to five after my last reset.
So im currently running on a 2 winstreak
I find it's easier to get back up to 5 winstreak in rumble
if youre playing solo that is
"Also, didn't they change it? You don't actually have to place 1st anymore"
I've just been super unlucky and gotten in to rumble matches with a bunch of sweats so I can't manage a podium finish.
You have to get at least 3rd in rumble to up the streak
I'm on my fifth reset though. Progress.
"oh my god, yeah"
better get it done soon!!
Like I said. Pvp hell. 🤣🤣 It's pretty much all I've been doing the past week.
I do wish there was a way to see you're streaks for the different activities
!heatmap Arixama#1187
wdym streaks?
"Like the win streaks for comp, quick play and gambit"
i thought there was an emblem for trhat?
There's one for longest streak but not current
ohh ok
YEEEESSSSSSS
Congrats!
ITS A GOOD DAY BOYS
The art is so nice!
FINAL PUSH TO BROADSWORD
You can dew it!
W00t
👍👍👍👍👍👍
Well my biggest achievement today was finally getting my 3rd reset:
Now i just need 6 more light v light kills for dredgen
I still haven't gotten a reset in infamy. 💀
Definitely gunna get omsome next season though.
"Yeah it's easy, just some time consuming grinding"
"I'll never get redrix or lunas, so this is something I can just mindlessly make progress towards"
Oh damn loads of people finish up some weapons today: i just saw two people get lunas in the towers
"Redrix is actually not terribly awful to get. It definitely takes some grinding, but most of the steps are pretty simple to accomplish"
I'm in this step:
"Gotta check how much further, I never looked it up"
"That's mountaintop, the grenade launcher. redrix is the orange one."
Oh so this one then:
Yep. Pulse precisions are probably the hardest step besides the 5 resets I'd say.
"The only one that really kind of disheartening is doing 25 of each type of match. Quick play, rumble and comp"
I though 40 matches of gmabit was hard
That's the only thing I've got left on breakneck. I need like 16 or so.
Then I'll be rerolling up a titan.
Why reroll?
I rolled up a new warlock cause my old one looked stupid. Deleted my titan to do it. Breakneck is the only thing I have left to complete on dumblock.
Then his stupid face shall be sent into the void
"Haha I know that feel, my hunter looks like she did her makeup in the dark"
I wish they'de add face customization
Maybe they will at somepoint now that they're not under Activisions thumb
I've heard Activision wasn't the worst publisher they could end up with. Atleast they didn't suffer like Anthem on release.
It took a couple weeks for vanilla d2 to suffer really. There was a decent amount of issues people had right from the get go though.
"It didn't brick ps4s though, so that's a step up from anthem 🎇"
"I quite like the game, it's just buggier than a sewer mattress"
I was planning on alternating between D2 and Anthem for the next several months.
"Now, oh well"
"I haven't played a lot of anthem. I just got the little social space. It's unsurprising it's a buggy mess though. EA wanted to capitalize on the destiny/division game style, took a team in the middle of working on one game and started them on a rush job for another game. 🤷‍♂️"
That said I do love the flight mechanic and Id love if anthem and destiny just had a baby.
"Also they are so much better at worldbuilding and telling stories, it just seems like a waste of everyones time."
Even the little snippets in anthem are pretty good!
Just ... sigh
But goddamn does it make me appreciate just how good destiny's shooting is
Peerless
Honestly between anthem and Andromeda I'm starting to worry about dragon age.
"Me too. Andromeda is in a better place now, but now Anthem? Scary trend. 

Atleast Bungie has never let us down."
Hey everyone!  What have I missed with my too-long of a break from Destiny?  Haven't played since the launch of Black Armory
Well you're back just in time for new content
"Since Black Armory launch, the newest raid has launched (Scourge of the Past), the remainder of the Forges have been opened, an endgame-ish activity has been opened (Niobe Labs), and The Last Word has been released back into Destiny via a Quest called ""The Draw"""
"With today's launch of Joker's Wild, a new version of Gambit will be launched (called Gambit Prime, a single round with specialized armor giving players specific roles within the Gambit Prime environment), a new endgame PvE activity called the Reckoning will be launched shortly which we have very little information about. Next week, we'll begin an ""Allegiance Quest"" where we can choose to side with the Vanguard or the Drifter (this is character based so you can experience both sides of the quest). Soon, the Thorn will return in another quest as well. No raid for this season."
Someone please let me know if I've missed something.
"oof, that's a lot!  Well, looks like I need to catch up on the grind ha"
The grind won't be horrible. Bungie added some bounties that are intended to bring you up to 640 light to help get you into Joker's Wild content faster.
Also Bungie gave everyone a free Gjallarhorn at the end of Black armoury.
"What I can say is that Scourge is a very fun raid, shorter than last wish but still very cool. The remainder of the forges are okay, there are some weapons I'd recommend grinding for good rolls on, otherwise you're not missing much. Two of the Black Armory exotic weapons drop from the forges, the third is completed from a quest."
I wish Ron lmao
"Anyways, The Last Word is very similar to its Destiny 1 Y3 iteration where it is nowhere near the stable laser that it was in Y1, though within about 25m it is one of the best hand cannons in the game for PvP. We don't know much, if anything at all about the Thorn and its effectiveness in PvP just yet, but it already appears to be different from Destiny 1"
"Niobe Labs is more of an optional endgame activity, think Shattered Throne but only rewarding cosmetic rewards rather than gear or weapons. That being said, it is still a very cool activity that took the community a couple of days to solve, and only after some help from Bungie."
Cosmetics are my kryptonite so I'll definitely need to do that.
"Man, balancing this, Sekiro, and The Division 2 is going to be a good time"
Oh I can imagine lmao
"So, I have a similar question to @Peronix, I have a cousin who wants to branch out from Fortnite/COD and I want to introduce her to D2. Do you think it's a good time now or should I wait for Penumbra?"
I'd say now since there's less content to catch up on than if she wanted to start on Penumbra
I'd say now personally.
"Alright, I'll get her a copy then. Thanks guys!"
No problem!
Holy butts: “Light vs. Light” can now be progressed by killing any Guardian (not just invaders) using a Super; this makes attaining Dredgen a less daunting task
This is amazing! I can finally get dredgen
@here any chance of getting a raid group together this weekend?
"I’ll be traveling till Sunday afternoon, but I’m down from then on"
I'm interested! I've been really busy with school lately but I think I've got some time this weekend.
What were you thinking of running @Arixama ?
"Preferably last wish and scourge if we can manage it, but I'd at least like to do that last encounter of last wish."
Absolutely. With or without le fromage?
Actually learning the encounter once is probably a good idea 🤣
Let's see if we can get a group together
What's recommended light on scourge?
630ish?
Minimum?
"Awesome, so I can easily pull my brother through the power surge bounties and have him raid ready"
"Yeah, youre right"
Power surge is a great way to prep for scourge
"Alright, let's see if there's interest in raiding today"
"Last Wish + Scourge, it looks like?"
What time will you be back Ron?
Time zones are confusing
"I'm about to board from Las Vegas right now, so I'll probably be ready to raid in around 6 hours?"
Okay
I should be home. Around 545 cst and then if we do the quick power surge bounties for @TheCnC he should be able to be raid ready quickly
How big is the update BTW? Cause I haven't launched the game in a week.
"I don't think it was too bad, it wasn't very big"
Perfect thanks
I think it was like. 4 gigs or so?
5 gigs from memory
Also I'm a hard *maybe*
"I have math quizzes and such to do that are due tomorrow at 11am, and some SolidWorks projects that are due tomorrow in class, so I want to jumpstart those"
no problem 👍
Anybody else interested in raiding tonight? @PC
we're good to go @Arixama @RonInDune @TheCnC
Alright I need like 2 more minutes for the update
"If we can get a quick gambit in, cnc will have all the power surge bounties done"
oh okay npnp
go for it
@Trissin we're good to go
I'm ready as well
Lemme get some tower bounties
if you guys need a ringer i'll be about for a bit! good luck!
Need help on the strike for unlocking Izanagi forge
"sorry, i'm not able to help you out right now because i've got some work to finish up :(("
Hey guys anyone down for a couple of Shattered Throne runs tonight?
I have a bounty running out soon
"I'm thinking about maybe organizing a raid today, if people are interested"
"Fuck, Fridays are the worst days for me"
"Ohhh, crap"
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Drdl86gU0AM-gd8.jpg
@PC Any interest in Scourge of the Past this weekend?
"Also last wish, possibly"
*raises hand*
I’m in for both.
Hey @Trissin do you think it'd be possible to play with someone in the Asia region? Or will the ping be too high?
"hmm, i havent tried it!"
"@PC If anybody is interested in raiding! Time is flexible, we can adjust it as needed."
when are you planning it for?
"Around 45 ish minutes form now, I think?"
"earlier is fine with me, but we're missing 2"
Doing some scrims otherwise I'd join :/
What are 'scrims'?
In this particular instance pvp practice
Scrimmages
Thanks
Is there a time that would work better for you @Oathbreaker ?
I wouldn't mind changing the time
We're going till 10:45 my time and with work tomorrow timing is rough regardless
@Trissin
"okay, no worries"
"Well it looks like we don't have enough for tonight, sorry guys @Arixama @RonInDune @Matos"
Can you guys help with the thorn quest finale then?
If you guys are only down one I can be available to be drug along
"haha we're missing 2, but thanks for the offer cnc"
what is the thorn quest finale @RonInDune ?
"The final, realy hard mission"
I think it's a heroic savathun's song
Also has specific enemies you have to kill similar to the exotic sword quests from d1
"ohh, i see"
how many people is it
"I've heard it's hard to solo, so I've been watiing tll some people were free"
3 I think
"3, but I don't know if you can do it without being on that step"
well lets see
It's called a strike so maybe I can pull people into it
How far are you from the thorn end @Trissin
wondering if it's like izanagi's where it won't let us join unless we're on that step
"i havent done anything for thorn lol, i think im on the titan step"
Ohh so the Escalation protocols
blind well actually
Oh yeah that one is a long one
actually i don't find it's too bad
i think 1 game of crucible got me to 27
or maybe it was 2 games? i dont remember
After thee final step I never want to play crucible again lol
Hey @PC I need some help with the Thorn strike 'Chasm of Screams.' Is anyone available?
hey @Samakain @TheCnC would you guys be interested in doing scourge of the past tonight?
https://braytech.org
Holy crap guys I just got two exotics from completing a gambit match
Karnstein and getaway artist
Niiiiice
anything going down tonight>
I'm down for raids/niobe labs/whatever
dont think there's anything planned at the moment
if we can get 6 together im happy to do scourge
"id be down for something but until thats decided, i got legos"
@PC Is there anybody interested in raiding tonight?
"in a LW now, but down for whatever if there is enough people"
"this  pug sucks, @Trissin save me!"
oh nooooo RIP
all done
still dont have 6 :\
Did you get 1KV?
negative
"barely any upgrades, 2 pieces that were +1"
LW doesn't seem very rewarding
anyone for gambit/prime?
Just got home from taking care of drunk friends at a St Patty's day part so I'm a little drained to be honest
"all good, we can do the raid next weekend"
Sounds like a plan
i thought most people were partying yesterday because classes tomorrow
I don't have the smartest friends
We'll just go with that
lool hope theyre doing alright
"I got the ones I was responsible for home safe, the others are home too. So all good hahaha."
Anyone down for a SOTP run?
"welcome! i dont think many people are on atm, lots are on CT"
"ya, it's a bit late i know."
Yes!!! Finally got it
Oxygen SR3
I had to solo Will of the Thousands like 12 times but worth
"my loadout is now pretty much set, i recently got a good threat level with trench barrel"
What else is on it?
"smallbore barrel is okay, accurized rounds is nice, grave robber is pretty situational but I like it"
"especially with tons of adds around, no need to reload"
"I've got trench barrel and quick draw. I don't super use  it, but I've got it if I need it"
Dang @Trissin Great work! I'll grind nightfalls when The Corrupted is back for sure
"Right, for the horror's least pulse rifle right? for cursebreaker"
I have so much gridning to do to get titles
Gotta grind Strang terrain for the weapon and EPs for the shotgun
ohh true yeah
that osprey eluded me for a little while
"and also I think EP is much easier to do now than it was before, we wouldn't need a team of 9 lol"
Definitely not. Could easily do just a team of three with a well and some thunderlords
"yep, what EP weapons do u need ron?"
SNiper and shotty
So any chance of us running raids this weekend?
I probably can't do one tonight unless it decently late. But I could do one tomorrow
@PC anybody else up for a raid tomorrow some time?
Yup tonight or tomorrow!
"Work tomorrow, and sick today so no clue if I'd be able to at all"
Oh I hope you feel better @Oathbreaker !
I'm down for anytime this weekend
Man the gambit prime weekly bounty is a craphsoot. I was on 12 the lost like 5 games in a row and went to 0 points
This feels harder than getting the last word solo
ari and I knocked that out in a great streak
i'm down for gambit if you need help
I'm just bad unfortunately
"I did 5 games of comp and lost 4, including one 4 v 2"
I'm having supper right now but I'll play again in like 20 mins
any raids happening today?
"Nothing is planned at the moment, but we can see if anyone @PC is interested"
I am!
So Matos Ron and I are. Anybody else?
Currently trying to see if we can gather 2 more
Do we have a time frame?
Can we LFG if noone else is free?
"No time yet, when are you guys free?"
"Also, what raid are we doing?"
Scourge?
Im good after 515 ish
"Scourge, and if we have time later something else"
"Scourge is faster, but I would definitely like to do a riven encounter if we've got the time"
Cnc is a maybe
Has Bungie upped the drop rates on Dreaming City cosmetics yet?
I believe that was this past tuesday
Great maybe I can finally get ship and 1KV
wait they upped the drop rate on 1k??
I know they plan to. Don't know if it is already
hmmmm im not sure how I feel about that
I don't know if it's actually drop rate or if it drop prote tion similar to nightfall weapons and ep weapons
Because there are people who have like 100 clears and it still hasn't dropped
"yeah, like RioT and those yeah"
i dont think theres anyone with >100 though
highest i've heard of is about 70
"which, still, is ridiculous of course"
I think drop protection makes sense but I don't think they should just straight up buff the drop rate
Im definitely ok with buffing the drop rate based on completions
"^
thats fine"
Sometimes I miss the D1 engram system. I liked knowing what slot something was going to be in
We need like two more people right?
and I was actually wondering if people might be interested in Spire
I always love spire
And I thing @Matos hadn't done it yet
"Yeah, it's a fun one, would love to take him thru it"
Plus I need to run a prestige Levi for the final acrius step
"oh, I do need to prestige leviathan as well, for a chance at the acrius catalyst"
What does the catalyst do?
"I believe it increases mag size from 2 to 6, and also increases reload speed"
the increase in reload speed is pretty significant
That's a massive change holy cow
It's up in the air if I actually have access to prestige lev
Pretty sure you need to do one regular levi before prestige
I dunno though I'm out of action still
"Yeee, I definitely don't have access on my warlock. I *might* on my hunter"
I'll check when I get home
i'm down for any of this stuff
just ping me
i do have access to prestige lev on my hunter
Blood hell solo comp is the *worst*
"Hey pc plebs, thinking about joining the ranks and building/buying a pc.  Would anyone have any recommendations for parts to pick or a prebuilt thats half decent.   Looking to hopefully spend less than 900cad for everything"
"Prebuilts aren't the best route to go these days, though every so often a decent one pops up on r/bapcsalescanada. In terms of parts, right now is a pretty good time to get into building on the Canada side. The Ryzen side of things is a good bet for a CPU, though with a new Ryzen lineup coming soon™ you may want to wait. Intel CPU's are more expensive generally unless you're willing to go for a used model, but even then, they can be a little pricey for my tastes. AMD's GPU line-up I have very little experience with so I do not know what performance is like with them, I've been an Nvidia guy from my first build on. Nvidia just released a 1660/1660ti which I believe lines up somewhere around a 2060 in terms of how well it runs, but just on 10xx series architecture. $900 CDN should get you a pretty solid build going these days"
"As an example, I just threw this together in about 5 minutes. I did go over your budget but there are some corners to be cut here and there: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/8bmGCb"
"Awesome.  Thank you, ill take a look at it after.  Would you recommend going with a ssd for a boot drive"
Definitely
If you get a decent sized one I'd also recommend putting the games you play regularly on there
"Yeah, if you can afford it go for it, I love my SSD."
I was thinking like a 120 or 40gb
250 lol
A 250 not a 40?
"That's what I have, and it pretty much has my Ps and destiny and whatever apps just defaultly install there"
"Also, Nvidia is bringing RTX to some of their 10xx series as well so you don't have to splurge on a 2080 to get that"
It depends on whether you're aiming for 4K 60+ fps or standard 1080p 60+fps
Well for the past year and a bit ive been gaming on a ps4 pro at 1080p 60fps so id like to bump it to atleast 1080p 80+ fps
"Then if you can manage the power requirements and the slightly higher price, the 2060 is the way to go I think"
"so i was playing around a bit and based off of the earlier build (trying to cut cost a bit) i came up with this https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/LFr6Hh, also while on my way home browsing kijiji i came across this link https://www.kijiji.ca/v-desktop-computers/winnipeg/gtx-1060-with-led-case-affordable-gaming-computer/1422911723?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true and was thinking it may be worthwhile to start with a used system and upgrade where needed?"
What're you planning on playing on it?
"probably starting with apex, fortnite, maybe d2 if its still cheap (since its apparently much better on pc then console)"
probably play halo when that comes out
I've got a 1060 3gb and it definitely runs d2 well. Not sure about fortnite or apex outside of the tutorial
"For some future proofing a 6 gig 1060 would be better, but this still a powerful setup"
"I've no idea about the processor, but I'd definitely at least upgrade the ram"
Just looked into it and it doesnt look to bad but it a chip from 2011
oh my god i got it
one eyed mask
the last forsaken exotic i've been missing
Bet xur sells it this week 😂
"Personally I'd be looking to upgrade from an i5-2400 Jets, but that would mean having to upgrade the motherboard to something newer, alongside the RAM, just so you can buy a newer CPU. It can be a little expensive but I also don't know how well that particular chip performs on games."
"Also, the PCPartPicker list you posted is pretty good. You can technically get away with 8GB of RAM as most things list that as the minimum, but 16 is become a little more common for certain programs and games (but still not super common). The GTX 1050ti is a card my buddy had for a while and he liked it, solid card for that price, it would be the first thing I'd recommend upgrading from when you have the chance."
Ive gone through and have been making so many different combos of parts to see what i can throw together with better parts but at a half decent price
Friendly reminder that The Corrupted is on nf rotation this week!
Anyone down for some grinding that one?
I might be interested! Depends how busy I get
i defintely would be

Congrats Ari! Are you the first in our clan to get to 700?
at least on the pc side i think
Damn dude nice going
👍👍👍
I'm still like 694ish
!rank maxpower
"yeah, unless matos hit it last night, i think im the first. hes been right on my heels the whole time, i thought he was gunna beat me to it"
I've been playing too much PvP to be getting big light gains lmao
I do wish there was a way to filter the bot so it did pc only
i wonder if it would work if u just added pc?
!rank maxpower pc
lol rip
"Hmm, maybe the !pve command? for all PC clan members?"
!pve
Let's try again:
"Nah I just got home now from work, still 699"
Huh I did not know that the the nightfall weapon drop chance goes up everytime you don't get it
Wish it worked that way for EP
it does
For EP as well?
"its not a lot, but it does"
Dang it I always gave up after 3 or 4 attempts
i think they implemented it the same time they put in the start from wave 6 thing
I don't need the keys to get the weapons right?
I might finally get the shotgun thsit iem then
"nope, just killing the boss"
any raids happening this week?
WE just need a couple more people I feel like
"Littlepants is getting his new laptop on Friday, he might be able to join us then"
We're always just missing 1 or 2
I'm a maybe
Depends on how I'm feeling and if I get things done efficiently
Is this week's double points for comp as well? Or only for regular crucible?
Believe it's Valor only
There's never been double Glory
Aww I thought I could make a try for Fabled
Oh well
Give a go anyways man
This season has better Glory gains in comparison to previous seasons
Huh I didn't know that
I keep getting to heroic and then dropping back
think I once had a 7 game loss streak that dropped me 3 ranks
I've had two sessions of comp and I'm around 1400
Holy cow
"You're pretty, pretty good"
My worst session was a 3v1 that we still somehow lost cause the other guy was a god
3v1 depending on the mode can favor the solo
"Survival especially, because you have so many lives and can farm out the weaker players on the other team"
Even clash really
Dude had a handcannon whose name I can't remember that had as good as or maybe better range range than my blast furnace
it was survival yeah
"Eh, Blast Furnace outranges all Hand Cannons"
"It was the mercury map, so I probably shouldn't have been using pulse rifles anyway"
The only two that can give a little bit of a fight are Not Forgotten and Ace
"Like at extreme range, that is"
I think it was not forgotten
That's one of the pinnacle weapons right?
"Yeah, that's the 5500 hand cannon"
oh great
that's a wee bit hard to get then lol
"I think I'm on the quest for that though, need to get comp hand cannon kills"
Likely Luna's
You need to get Luna's before you get Not Forgotten's quest
ohhhh
dang ok so not forgotten user are legit good players
For the most part
then why do they get matched with people on low glory?
Kinda unfair
"There are players who have bought the gun, or cheese comp matchmaking for it"
"Eh, if it's early in the season they're not 5500 ranked anymore"
Wait you can buy the gun?
"""Buy"""
Like Eververse?
"No, god no"
Basically you pay someone $350ish and upwards to go on your account and get you to 5500 and do the quest for you
$350!!!!
The hell
That was the lowest I've heard of
Mostly around $500
Man people have too much money and too little sense
If it was $15 I might've considered
Or like I can send the guy Pizza or something
"I know someone who wants to pay for it, I've repeatedly told him he's an idiot because if he improves he can realistically get to 5500"
"I plan on making a 5500 run this season or next, I want the gun"
Good luck! You're one of the few who's legit good enough to get it!
"I'm still working on redrix, need a bunch of arc kills. Wondering what's a good weapon for that"
"Hand Cannon: Waking Vigil, Jack Queen King 3, Nation of Beasts
Shotgun: Badlander, Good Bone Structure (only if you're confident with your shot and comfortable with slug shotguns), fusions are *okay* but wouldn't recommend
Heavy: Wardcliff, Play of the Game, Legend of Acrius, Thunderlord"
Not super familiar with any other options so
Don't quite know
"Ooh Jack Queen is the mercury weapon, literally never used it"
But I do have a good waking vigil roll might try that one
Is dragonfly in good in PvP though?
*any good
"For Hunters, arcstrider is okay, not my pick personally. Titans have top or Middle tree arc, and I've seen some players bringing back top tree Stormcaller"
Eh
Not really?
What's the other perks?
I have a zen moment/outlaw and a zen moment/dragonfly
Zen/Outlaw if it has more range would be better
Zen/Dragonfly is eh
"Oh yeah it has fantastic range: armour piercing rounds, sureshot, and range tier 5 upgrade"
That's a solid roll
Guess I'm using that for a while then! Thanks a lot for the advice!
"Yeah, no problem! If you have any questions just let me know. I probably play too much PvP these days."
"yeah I'm going to pick your brain later on the grenade launcher quest, just can't seem to get that medal"
For arc kills I'd suggest running arc subclass with inaugural address if you've got it
"I used inaugural address for my void kills, it's like a laser that gun!"
"I think its a default arc gun, so if you pull it from collections it's should be arc"
Ohhh I didn't realize that
Huh I have it as fire and void in my collections
"GLs aren't my specialty hahaha, with that being said I can probably still give some advice"
Like in your vault?
"Oh yeah that's what I mean, sorry"
"Yeah, if you print it from your collections should be arc."
Perfect
Definitely keep those fire and void ones though. Cant get them any more
^^^^^
Oh man I wish I had made more copies of the best year 1 guns with different elements
I wish I still had my void perfect paradox
"Perfect paradox got moved to primary though, did it not?"
Yuuup
Yeah that's what I figured
That's why I whish I still had it
"on the topic of PVP and loadouts i'm gonna still gonna rep the scout rifles, they're not in a good spot at the moment but I like them"
jade rabbit and polaris lance are my favourites
"it's dependent on the map though, some maps just wont let you run a scout"
"I tried the mida kinetic scout recently and thought it was ok, I think it suits people who have better aim than me"
"Mida is actually pretty good, scouts are in an alright spot right now but are highly dependent on the map"
I'd say the exotic scouts can really put some work in if used right
My problem with scouts (and snipers) is the flinch
I feel like the mods aren't that helpful
joining the club
Snipers take some time to get used to
Basically if you don't get first shot you need to get out of the engagement
Take that from someone who loves sniping
"alright, anybody interested in doing the corrupted ~~a few~~ like 80 times?"
lets do it
I can't today but a big YES tomorrow onwards!
YOu better not get the curated pulse before me
hahaha dont worry with my luck it probably wont happen
"i will, thats just how it works 😂"
"Good good, otherwise I curse you with only getting edge transit drops forever"
"hmm, i think it would be most efficient to get a 200k+ score first, and then farm"
still pretty easy since we can easily do a +100 hanicap
"yeah, we should get a third though. Anybody interested in a high score run for the corrupted nightfall? @PC"
"guys, just get it on your first try"
!pve weapons
Ooh did you get it?
i did!
Ooof congrats
haha thank u! not curated though
Severely jealous right now
SO you're wayfarer?
I don't think you need it for wayfarer actaully!
you need the osprey
youre thinking cursebreaker
Oh sorry yeah cursebreaker
ghost and the sparrow is the roughest part of that one
I don't have the ship or the ghost I think
i dont have em either
theyre super rare for some reason
Yeah I've done two ascendant challenges almost every week since they started and I still haven't gotten the drop
Though I haven't done the speed runs for all the challenges yet
Maybe that's why
I have used thorn so much
DO you have all the lore yet?
I still only got like5 or 6
Nope still got 2 pages left
So @Trissin what loadout did you guys use for The Corrupted farm? And did you get the triumph for killing her using two orbs or less?
"We did get the triumph, yeah"
"Not on purpose though, lol"
"For loadouts I used 1kv and sentinal shield with ursa, ari used tractor with slowva bomb and skull"
Ooh I'll go with Ari's loadout
Hey anyone down to help Jokon with the thorn quest?
"hmm, is it possible to do a run of scourge or spire or something today? @PC"
I can't today
maybe another time then
i'm down
"Alright @PC , is anyone interested in doing a regular Leviathan? I have a friend who recently got into the game, just passed 300 , and I'd like to take him through"
still need to get acrius
I should be home around 5ish
"okay cool, that sounds good to me"
Plus I need normal leviathan on my new warlock anyway.
"right, yeah"
"So, we're going to regular leviathan and then go right back into prestige, right? 😜"
"honestly, this group is fairly experienced so we'll see how the run goes and maybe we can actually do that lmaoo"
"The light on prestige is capped at 300,right?"
"I believe so, yeah"
@handley
!lfg join 10
Do we know what the challenge is this week?
"no, not sure, and I can't seem to find it either"
I think it's dog challenge?
Is the dog challege the one where you can only shoot once a phase?
I've heard that can be anoying to pull off
"that's the one, yeah."
the other option is to just get 2 stacks
It's very easy with 2 stacks as a warlock
"^
it shouldn't be too bad yeah"
we could try for it
"AH perfect then, my nova bombs and grenades and tractor cannons melt everything anyway"
Personally I'm hoping for calus challenge
"Calus challenge is cool, but it's annoying that we can't all be chilling in one well"
Yeah but it's the only one I don't have completed 😭
Also scatter grenades do wonders on the dogs as a voidlock
"yeah, voidwalker and tractor cannon is pretty crazy in leviathan lol"
"Also, I can run for gauntlet and do a prism on dogs if needed"
Same with me!
"sure, that's great. we'll make sure to work out the roles and stuff when we get to the encounters"
@RonInDune @Arixama Matos said he needs about an hour or so until he's ready and we are still missing one
"Options are : we could LFG for 2 now, or we could wait for Matos to come back, see if anyone is available, and if not, LFG 1"
checking with my brother quick
okay sure
We can wait for @Matos I'm in no hurry
https://twitter.com/CORSAIR/status/1112455241872691207?s=19
whats this
its a game launcher launcher
i believe its corsair's april fools
lmaoooo
but honestly i would love something like that
if it was literally just an application that read your game library and allowed you to launch stuff from it
btw any response from your brother ari?
"nope, my guess is he's alseep"
okay lol
we need 1 more for a fresh run of regular leviathan @PC !
no exp. required
I still need you guys' help for farming the corrupted when youre free
he just got back to me
should be ready soonish
"oh, sweet okay"
just waiting on matos then
"so Matos isn't responding, what do you guys want to do @Arixama @RonInDune 
should we keep waiting or get someone else?"
we could also play some gambit or do EP or something while we wait
im up for whatever
"alright, trace and I are going to finish this story mission and then we can play gambit or something until matos is ready"
coolio.
"whats the ep weapon this week, smg?"
you get trace whisper yet?
ohh actually no he doesnt have that yet
we should do that
"alright, all ready to go? @RonInDune @Arixama"
Uhh I though we werne't starting soon so I went for inner
*dinner
oh noooooo
I'm so sorry
no its okay
dont worry about it
Can you give me like 15 mins
I'll run back
lol okay
also do we have a 6th? @Arixama
ALright guys I'm logging in right now
Really sorry for the delay
I'm ready whenever
"yep, sorry, we just finished our crucible match"
trace will be back in a minute
"@Matos know you just logged off, but we realized we didn't open the ventilator chest"
we're going to go grab it now
i'm good
"ok np, thanks again for joining us"
it was fun!
Hey guys anyone down for a bit of nightfall grinding? I need to run the corrupted a bit for the gun...
"i just finished my lab @RonInDune , im hopping on now"
We have the best clan! Thanks again @Trissin and @Arixama
got my shader!
Oooh congrats!
Where did you get it form finally?
off a pulse rifle in bergisa
The curated one?
Hey guys are there any tricks to get a second character to 700 fast? Or is it the same grinding as usual?
"kind of depends. but definitely put your highest weapons on, and then check your collections and print out some leveling gear until it stops increasing"
also with all weapons being 700 its just a higher light jump on powerfuls anyway.
Should I have the 700 weapons on me or is it eough to have them in the vault?
i'd have them on you. usually i just transfer over the weapons i usually use and equip them since its what i like using anyway
"That's true. I tend to use different weapons on different characters just for the feel of it, but for light levelling purposes the same guns would help"
Wish I could print hunter armour as warlocks somehow lol
You should be able to? Just pull it from your collection on warlock?
"Huh last I tried it didn't allow me to, lemme see again"
BUt that was a just when the colelctiosn launched
That's the first Pinnacle of many
congrats!!!! thats awesome
"(I forget, what are the requirements for the recluse?)"
Fabled in comp and a bunch of wins
"Hmm, that's almost doable. I might try for it"
"If you're doing fabled anyway, you might as well also attempt for lunas"
"I'm around Brave II and Brave III usually, if I get any higher I tend to go on massive loss streaks"
Thanks guys. Recluse is get to 2100 and just win a bunch (you'll have that finished when you get to 2100)
"You're pretty, pretty good!"
Woo!
Niiice
Next step: solo flawless
"I think it's it's definitely doable, I had like only 4 deaths in total and that was because I was experimenting different setups for dul incaru"
So vorgeth didn't get you at all?
believe it or not I only died at vorgeth 1 time
"i used a long range pulse rifle to camp adds, and a void fusion rifle for the wizards"
it's really not too bad if you just sit in a corner and play extremely slowly
"you have plenty of time between adds respawning, I used hunter invisibility to roam around freely without getting focused down"
we should do a raid this weekend
"spire, LW or Scourge"
"yes we should, i would like to do that"
"is there any interest in doing one tonight, possibly?"
Maybe spire or scourge cause they're super short?
What's the prestige requirements this week?
"gladiator with shotgun, auto, rocket"
oof
I think that's actually pretty good!
"shotgun and rocket are good, auto is meh"
I'm hearing Wardcliff off of that
I have no idea what Gladiator means though
gladiator is a really good buff modifier
Isn't the spire boss A bit too far for wardcliff? I was thinking two tailed fox might stop the rockets
Wardcliff was the strat for a while even before the buff
Let me grab an old clip
your group gets an empowering rift (no well at the time) on top of the box container things near the front
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOD4zcB0MKs
That was back in June
Now it's been buffed
"I can't do tonight, but I should be able to do tomorrow"
oh wow that melted
"yeah, gladd's team is pretty impressive lol"
well we're better!
"i saw a video this morning where they killed morgeth from the other side of the bridge, in last wish"
maybe
wat
With Mountaintop
how did they get him to spawn
It was beautiful
"I think they started in the arena and as they picked up strength they flew back across, most of them or all of them were warlocks and you can fly back across that bridge with the icarus dash tree"
that's illegal
Bungie nerf that clan
Oh @Oathbreaker your waking vigil idea was really good! I got the arc kills in no time
Glad it worked Ron
"hey @Oathbreaker , by the way, how many people did you play with to get the recluse? no way it was solo right?"
Did a 4 stack
ah okay I see
Was everyone as good as you?
Equal or better lol
@RonInDune it doens't look like we'll have enough for a raid tonight but i'm thinking we could try something like niobe if youre in
I'm good but not amazing
Oh heck yeah I'm down for niobe
Had to be atleast an hour from now though
thats completely fine
"also @Oathbreaker littlepants just got a new computer, he's thinking about making the push for luna's and etc."
just thought you'd like to know
"Well, I'm happy to play every now and then"
"awesome, maybe we'll hit you up for some crucible sometime"
"Oh I wanted to ask, do you get the bonus for playing comp every week even if you lose?"
there's a bonus for playing comp?
I though you get like some points if you play 5 games or so every week? Or am I misremembering something?
Yeah 3 games
120 points
Holy cow that's more points than I expected
Wonder if I can get fabled just off of that lol
Let's see if people are free to do scourge or something today
looks like pants is free as well so that makes 4
2 more for scourge today? @PC
"Also if we have some people available, I'd like some help for a couple of shattered throne runs"
yeah we can see! what do u need from shattered throne?
"i'll be running two ST, one of the runs going for all bones"
Oh I'll join up then
"oooh bones
i'd like to get in on that one as well"
I need the ship!
"right, ship. do u have the ghost?"
No just the sparrow
Ghost and ship are the only things left
ohh I see
"that reminds me, I really need the glittering key from last wish"
for the raid ship
Ooh for rivensbane?
Yeah I'm super far from those
I need the ship and I need to do petra's
Petra's damn thats a toughie
"yeah, im wondering how difficult it will be. I think if everyone plays slowly and remains patient it shouldnt be too bad"
Yeah the strats are safe enough that only the platforming and other random stuff can screw us
i have a glittering key and need the eggs from LW
"so i'm down for LW, i'd love a NoB or chattering bone"
:o u have a glittering key???
jealoussss
"yea, not sure where i got it"
it opens some chest you have to wish for
"yeah, theres a secret chest between morgeth and the vault that gives u the raid ship"
"glittering key is a rare drop at the end of the raid, kinda like 1kv"
i am available for scourge
or whatever
oh okay sweet
we got any sort of time frame?
If you guys need me I can be available
that would be great!
What time are you guys thinking?
hmm well ron pants and I are free right now
when are you and @Matos free?
Give me about 20-30 minutes I can be.  Not sure about @Arixama or @Matos
i'm free whenever
Ok I'll hop on here in just a few minutes then
Hopping on now
alright if everyone's good
you guys are all full lol
"Just got the Recluse, and Pants finally got his Luna's 😄"
I need to work on that...
I finally got all the Thorn lore pieces! Mindless grinding for the win!
congrats!!! also your triumph score is so high 😮
THank you!
"I'm almost at the Chronicler seal, which is the only one that actually matters to me lol"
oh my god
that one is so freaking rare
and like so hard to get as well
Yeah it's a lot of exploring
im not even sure i've actually seen that in game before
someone with chronicler title
you should go for it ron
The only ones I still need to get is the one where I have to steal 3 motes while invading
And the last dreaming city lore which I've been waiting for for months now
wait how many are you missing? do u know?
Yeah 1 from gambit invading and stealing 3 motes.
And 1 from the dreaming city
The other is the truth to power which you get every 3 weeks from Mara
youre only 3 triumphs away from chronicler?
holy crap
Basically 4 lore pieces
Honestly it's a lot of looking up youtube guides
It's actually impossible to have chronicler right now I think?
I think some people have glitched into getting some Truth to Power drops
"hey so I know @Matos wanted to run ST before the reset tomorrow, let me know if u need me"
"I believe @RonInDune and @Arixama also needed to complete it, maybe u guys can fireteam up"
i'll be on standby if needed
I think Ari and Matos were running it last night
ohh okay
But I'm super down for two runs
One warlock and one hunter
"yeah, let me know if u need me"
Cool maybe this evening
"I know we did a run of it, but i think Matos wanted another one on a different character?"
Oh okay are you guys running it this evening
I haven't made any plans for anything this evening
"I'm down, i could do it on my hunter"
Might we potentially have enough people to do a do a couple of riven encounters later this evening?
oh i do want that glittering key
"perhaps, we'll have to see"
Is glittering key a drop off of riven?
"it's the same as 1kv, it's a drop from the chest at the end of queenswalk"
i'll be around
"yo, i might get a PC this summer. have a question about processors. was originally looking at a Ryzen 5 2600 and 1660Ti card - on a budget so that stuff worked out great. but...my MicroCenter has the Ryzen 5 1600 for 79.99 USD, and I was wondering if that's a worthwhile purchase because that price is incredible. I won't be playing many games on PC so I'm really just looking for a combo that gets good and stable fps and overall longevity."
@Oathbreaker i think you were the one that helped out jets last time?
"Just studying for some finals, will message later"
Okay sorry
Busy week
"I think the general feeling from PC enthusiasts is that the 2600 is better than the 1600 but not insanely so, it is a jump, but not a massive massive jump, so if you're on a tight budget go with the 1600, but otherwise it is almost always better to get the 2600."
@thegoaliebear ^
okay sweet...i'm still at a build under $1000 with either so i'll probs end up going with the 2600 then.
were people still planning on shattered throne?
Yup in like 30 mins
do you need a third?
pulled stronghold
Nice!
THe titan gauntlets?
Is it OP?
I dunno. But it's swords
Wonder if it helps face tanking reckoning tier 3 bosses
OK HOLD ON NOW
are we able to still get cayde treasure maps?
the maps? i dont think so
it must be talking about the chests as a part of the ace quest then?
"hmm, i dont think so tho"
im not sure
Aww this is sad:
Wardcliff was too good though
It melted bosses beforehand
After the buff it was too ridiculous lmao
Not saying it wasn't fun
"it's okay, you can replace it with 1kv 😈"
"Yeah we kinda destroyed the spire of stars boss in seconds, felt a bit op"
It was crazy fun
Oh 1k is easily one of my favorite exotics
I want Anarchy though
riven farm when?
ill be cheesed if oath gets anarchy before me
"because you got 1k on like, your third run???"
I got 1k after 4 runs yeah
>.<
"You were at like 60 something, right/"
?*
nooo not that high
twenty something
26
Ah okay
"I know a guy who got it last week, took 70 something runs"
Someone else still doesn't have it after 80+ runs from memory
"im not actually sure, right, because I also had a fair amount of killing riven but not doing queenswalk"
for keys
Where was this happening do you guys know?
But I want to
i'm curious as well
Kinda like Swoletheon
I want to see it at least once
hahahahaha
id love to see that
I'm interested in the Last Word change to be honest
Does that mean Fan Fire is no longer infinite duration on the stacks?
wait they are changing last word? i thought they just added a timer
"Yeah it's just a timer, but before Fan Fire stacked up to 4 times and had no duration, as long as you didn't ADS or swap weapons you had the perk indefinitely"
What I want to know is if it now runs out
Ah so like memento mori on ace
Doesn't really affect me because I almost always ADS so Fan Fire is redundant but for others who hip fire that would be a harsh nerf
"yeah, it would be kinda rough for them if they just added a timer on the perk"
unfortunately i dont know since i dont use last word much
Also interested in the Nova Warp stuff just because I liked the super for Warlock stuff
oh I heard they're bringing back hawkmoon and darkdrinker?
Rumors right now
for penumbra
huh
itd probably make it less common in crucible and stuff
"rumors based on leaks, right?"
"Yeah, but AnontheNine has been silent for a bit if I remember correctly"
So who knows if it ends up being true or not
"Don't get me wrong, I love me some Hawkmoon, and the lucky bullet stacking made it hilariously dumb, but I don't know if it would have a place in the PvP meta"
"Also, as an avid hand cannon user..... *SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR ONCE BUNGO PLEASE*"
lmaoooooo
Give us a cool pulse
Or an AR
I would like another exotic pulse
next up are the first curse and fatebringer
Or a scout
^^
scout pls
I don't care what it is but even as someone who loves hand cannons
There's like 9 of them now
a _lot_ of options
GIVE US A GUN WE USE RIVENS HEART FOR
"Sturm, Crimson, Last Word, Ace, Thorn, I feel like I'm missing out on some"
Malfeasance
6 seems right but maybe not?
sunshot?
thats energy tho
Sunshot
Doesn't matter
It's a Hand Cannon
"_""How could you forget about me?""_"
It works pretty well for the hollowed lair strike
"ALso now I have to do quite a bit of gambit invading, sigh"
why?
i think he needs the lore
I'm curious
"Yeah ""mote thief"""
I want to see what I'd need to do for Unbroken
unbroken
go you!
But uh... That would likely break me contrary to the title
LMAOO
probably the same stuff i need honestly
I know it's reach Legend and then reach legend x3
"You need like a trillion resets right, for unbroken ?"
oh god not for me
"I'm in class, otherwise I'd check"
5 valor resets probably too
I can easily do that when my finals finish
"legend, legend in multiples season, fabled in multple seasons and 5 glory ranks across all seasons are probably the difficult ones you need"
Not horrible tbh
I mean
Other than legend
getting legend is difficult isn't it...
Legend is pretty difficult
i think you'll have an issue getting the third legend. other than that you have a pretty good group that you pvp with
"i believe at mythic you need like what, a 3 streak to actually gain more points than a single loss?"
Might be two Trissin but I don't have those values just yet
"yeah, youre right, it's 2"
honestly the only reason i think youll have issues getting your third legend is cause the third season will be when school has started up for you
"Yeah, that'll be the only thing"
I won't get the seal before the rewards deadline regardless so I'm really in no hurry
new catalysts relased too 😮
i wonder what they do
Uh
Give me a few minutes and I can get the info I think
"I'm not looking in the right spots apparently, light.gg shows the catalysts but doesn't say what they do outside of stat bonuses"
"its okay, i can check in game later"
ty tho
I cannot wait for Finals to be over so I can finally start making progress in the run to 5500
It's like an itch I can't scratch lmao
"That being said when I've got time, if anyone here wants some help in getting to 2100 or just improving in general, I'm more than happy to help"
I teamed up with Trissin and Littlepants couple of days back and it was a disaster
I think we lost 3 comp games in a row
I should probably practice a lot more
PvP practice is honestly just playing the game
"Go into PvE and act like any thrall is a player, practice movement, aim, that sort of thing"
UMMMM
DID YOU JUST GET THAT
I JUST PULLED IT FROM A FATED ENGRAM FROM XUR?
WHAT
WHAT THE FUCK
:OOOOOOO
UH
ARI
HOW
IN
THE
FUCK
IM SORRY I DONT DESERVE 1K ANYMORE
you broke destiny
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
ARI LOG ONTO MY ACCOUNT AND BUY THE ENGRAM PLEASE
I WANT PROOF
VIDEO
-______________-
brb gonna go buy a fated engram
Reset just happened
You're too late
the ps4 guys want me to go play crucible with it
Go play Crucible with it
go play crucible with it
im gunna wait here in xurs inventory and see if the invitation shows up
I think that was patched with this update
"oh right, thunderlord is back"
Thunderlord is indeed back
Not that I need it
I want that Arbalest though
so it looks like xur is still here
at least his model is still in the world
you just cant interact with him
Ah
I think if you refresh the instance it'll probably boot him out of there
Hallowed Lair is up for a Mindbender's Ambition farm
"yeah, i just closed the game
but someone else there also had wavesplitter"
Wtf???
I wish
Io Flashpoint as well
its gotta be a bug
OH
OKAY
COOL
BACK TO BUYING THOSE EVERY WEEK THEN ON MY TITAN AND WARLOCK
sameee
i dont know what else to do with all these legendary shards
It's happening on Xbox as well
Someone had Wavesplitter drop
"let's see, what do I really want though"
forsaken exotics
"I think shards, phoenix, geomags are the big ones"
that i'm missing
"Pheonix, Geomags, Heart of Inmost Light, and OEM for me are the 4 I want"
I think I'm done all the Forsaken Exotic weapons
"Well, not Malfeasance because I don't like playing Gambit enough to finish that quest lmao"
"i think i need a couple of things for hunter and titan, but everything else ive got"
I know I'm done Hunter and close for Warlock
Also prestige raids are Prism with Hand Cannon/Sniper Rifle/Anything
On the one week I can't play too much D2 because of exams the prestige raids get decent modifiers damn
were u planning to do some prestige raids??
For the Catalysts I was thinking about it
"oh, telesto and sleeper?"
"Yeah, or Acrius, or Skyburner's"
i think acrius and skyburner coime from prestige leviathan
so the modifiers dont make a difference
i think skyburners is just regular leviathan?
didnt we have someone get it the other week?
"oh yeah, i think youre right"
"""The Heavy as Iron emblem may be earned when securing 2500 kills under the effects of the Iron Burden""

Better be a cool as fuck emblem or I'm gonna care about it as much as I cared about the Wizened Rebuke - I didn't"
i was trying to find what it looked like
didnt get anything
"Well, I'll see it when somebody finds out how to view it"
I don't have a reason to go for it unless it looks cool
I far prefer my current emblem choices otherwise
!weekly
lol lens of fate
damnit
Looking for something specific?
its the other mercury strike thats got the weapon
DFA?
The Hand Cannon?
probably?
That's the only other strike on Mercury so
i just kinda want all the strike weapons
JUST IN CASE
"Oooh EP has all 3 again, time to grind for those again"
Bungie's gonna get ya @Arixama
"Nah, they're just gunna make some thin I'm probably not going to use anyway unusable 🤣"
Ah so it turns out you just won't be able use it for a few months
That's fucking stupid lmao
Let people use it
They cant
I mean contract yeah
I just think it's a little silly but whatever
"They will straight up get sued by Sony, unfortunately."
"Yeah, the contract is the contract, I get that"
I'm just happy they're not un-unlocking it. It's the best they can really do in this situation
"Yeah, it makes sense what they're doing just sucks that it'll take a place in your vault or inventory"
That being said you'll have it when it unlocks so no need to chase it lmao
"i mean it's one slot, and it unlocked in collections"
"Unlocked in collections too, damn then nevermind"
That's still pretty solid
@Oathbreaker
https://clips.twitch.tv/MoistConsiderateTapirNerfRedBlaster
not sure if you've seen this
I think I saw that live
It's great
Hey can anyone help me get the double trouble dreaming city triumph?
I need two people
what do you need?
3 people need to stnad on 3 rock circles in front of the gate in the first are of the dreaming city
https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/02/destiny-2-forsaken-dreaming-city-secret-double-trouble-triumph-twin-chests/
that sounds easy enough
Yeah it just takes too long for the area to spawn
Like 15 minutes or so
aw thats annoying
The little stone circles are supposed to glow
And that doesn't happen as quick as I'd like
just let me know when you have a third and i can help
Thanks I will!
i dont mind helping out either
i dont know when the rocks will be glowing though
Hmm Lemme go and check right now
Also mayhem is the best mode of all time
Rift is
Fight me
Which one's rift again?
"Reverse capture the flag. Only in D1, introduced in the Taken King. Take the ""flag"" to enemy base, dunk for points"
Oooh that sounds interesting
is that the one where u run around with the spark
That's the one
that was a good one
Honestly that sounds like a halo ish game mode
It was kinda like Oddball mixed with 1-flag CTF
Also I think they recently added a new EDZ triumph
oh?
You have to get kills in gmabit prime and crucible using the thorn
that wasn't there before was it? Inthe veyr last page
oooh it's starting
is anyone online?
Definitely wasn't there
come to the dremaing city if you can
"Can log in, need three minutes"
"no worries, join up when you can"
"A reminder! You can apparently get ""A Man With No Name"" lore book entries by doing gambit prime bounties."
Is that daily or weekly bounties?
"Not sure, I think both"
So any chance of us doing any raids this weekend?
I definitely can't. My computers a little bit fucked right now.
Oh no! What's wrong there?
"Potentially a processor issue. Got a replacement on the way, and hoping that fixes it"
Oof that's tough. Good luck!
"I've had overheating issues with this processor in the past, so hopefully it'll be OK, since it wont have 4-5 years of use on it"
i'm always down
"If we don't have enough for a raid, we might try niobe labs again @Trissin!"
oh yeah im down for that @RonInDune
"although not right now, is anybody else tuning in to the LCS finals"
What's LCS?
LoL championships
TSM had a 2-0 lead
I'm gonna be so sad if they throw it
"Went into my exam series at 0-0, came out with TSM up 2-0"
Hope you aced your test!
RUDE liquid didn't have a great start but they're pulling it back
this reverse sweep is gonna happen 😈
"Nah, TSM has fucking got this in the bag"
You hear about the SKT vs Griffin series?
"No, I didn't see that one"
What happened?
SKT 3-0'd Griffin
ZVEN WHY
yaaaaaas let's go liquid
"Sweet, just finished petra's run! now all i need is that glittering key"
Oh damn congrats!
how many runs did it take!!!
actually not many! i had a group two days ago that did 2 tries and we got to queenswalk
and then today's group died twice at kalli and then we completed it!
You're pretty good!
"lol, thanks ron 👍"
Have they increased the glittering key drop rate in this patch?
"i think so, yeah"
haven't gotten it yet though 😦
Fingers crossed for you!
thanks!!!
ALso I wish I'd get 1KV as well
I really need to do more raids
yeah you should  j o i n   u s
School is keeping my ass busy at least until next week
@Oathbreaker you're a PvP god so you've transcended us mere mortals
"Lmao, trust me, there's a large number of players who would destroy me, I'm in no way a god at crucible hahaha"
Bungie's PvP has almost always had me hooked. Destiny is no exception.
I mean you've absolutely shredded eveyr game I've played with you lol. But yeah I understand
Bungie's gunplay is honestly the best I've ever expreienced
"Like nothing else, right? Got me addicted to it pretty much"
"I don't think there's any other game with guns that feel as good as, say, graviton lance, or whisper, or midnight coup, you anme it"
Hey so anyone down for some comp tonight?
I'm going to get to fabled or die trying
Hopefully I'll have a running computer tonight
sweet! if that's the case actually do you think it's possible to run a raid or something:?
"Tentative yes. Basically I'm replacing the current processor I've been using for 5 years with the exact same model that's new, so if the processor is the problem it'll be fixed for now"
"okay, let us know how it goes!"
Whoops?
Damn man
those poor kids
Looks like my kinda game
4 or 6 stack?
looks like 4 lol
4
1 guy was AFK the entire match
"Anchored our spawn for the team, so we basically spawn killed them 100% of the time"
So new processor didnt fix it and now it won't turn on at all
Huh I've never had this happen before:
"Yeah it's on mercury I let it sit there for 5 minutes, still didn't let me spawn"
Protip you have to complete the curse of Osiris story to do the strikes on the map
Ooof yeah I'm figuring that out the hard way now
Atleast I managed to masterwork the huckleberry from start to finish doing the adventures
Niice
"Oh also, blackout makes it almost impossible to do reckoning imo"
I kept getting killed even within well
finally got the ship!!!
haha finallyy
gat damn congrats
arbalest requires 7 revelry triumphs completed
:o are they difficult?
"not super difficult, just slightly grindy"
oh my god the verdant forest is not fun
i love it
"I'm watching a stream and it seems warlock nova bomb is pretty useful, alongside tether"
Though i'm still not sure how it all works
i am not enjoying this
"its basically haunted forest from hallowween, but instead of getting a boss every so often, you get 5 at the end, with the amount of time based on how many braches you cleared"
its not based on how many branches u cleared
here
I will show you why I did not think it was fun
"when we got to 100, nothing special happened, so we literally sat there and waited out the remaining 3 minutes"
WHY DID YOU DO THAT
well this was my first run
how much time did you have at the end?
i was thinking like haunted forest or something
like
"""something MUST happen at wave 50 , otherwise there wouldnt be a triumph for it"""
nothing happeend
"""okay, maybe 100? """
still nothing
so then we just kinda waited it out
"our 3rd guy was clever, he left at like wave 20 or something"
"this other guy and I, it was our first run for both of us"
so we were likie
what do we do?/
how much time did you have for the bosses?
"like, 3 minutes?"
but since there's so many adds it doesnt really matter
"ok, so theres a limit on it, but the branches defitely have some effect on the time you get at the end."
i had a run with 6 branches cleared and we only got 30 seconds
yeah that run was so long that our tincture thing ran out
i had to put in more essence halfway through
they should make the enemies harder the further you go or something
I saw Teawrex on twitch do a 110 branch run with some level 30 randoms and they got 5 minutes for 5 bosses
Ohhh what
Maybe I had 5 minutes then? I don't remember too clearly
so i got the rat king catalyst
who wants to complete it for me?
What do you have to do?
"you have to  kill enemies, but only pve enemy kills from fireteam members using rat king count"
verdant forest
but i gotta have someone else get the kills
"yeah, i think verdant forest is a good place to do it"
i'm down for verdant forest stuff
"so i think the way it works is that for each branch you complete, you get 5 seconds for the bosses at the end"
Oh damn already!
it was
"not that hard, honestly"
I thought it required like a week's worth of grinding!
you only need 7 of the triumph
"I just got on, I could do forest as well"
Oh hey @Thawxtem ! It's been a long time!
"ya sorry, I was depressed because I thought I missed a deadline for the pins on bungie rewards but apparently they extended it"
Oh I hope you're better now. We missed you on the raids!
"not literally depressed, just majorly burnt out because with only one luck-based item left for my goal, I thought all my grinding went to waste"
What were you missing?
DC ghost shell
Ooof
"I'm missing the ghost shell as well, plus the ship"
got lucky with the ship with a random group; 1st boss in the dungeon
"btw, I haven't played at all this season. Where did Drifter go? he's not in his usual hideout that im used to"
"Annex, should be a blue flag"
...mote bank looks creepy outside gambit
"thawxtem! welcome back, it's been so long!"
"hope youre doing better now, we've missed you"
"thanks! I think the break was actually good for me. bummed I missed suff, but the forest is a great way to get the hang of fighting again"
@Arixama how is arbalest??
havent tried it yet
4 shots to pop a shield with matchgame on
that's pretty good!
actually i dont know the ammo economy of the gun but it seems pretty good to me
"17 ammo, 5 magazine"
special ammo
hmm I think that's alright
how good is the raw damage?
"maybe like, 3/4 of a sniper shot i am guessing?"
was doing like 40000 some on a crit in dc on a red bar
😮 it one shots with precision shot in crucible
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/be1fcv/all_you_need_to_know_about_the_arbalest/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
"so basically you can take a crooked fang as your special, but you give up your exotic slot"
You can basically run crooked fang ep shotty and thunderlord
It goes in the kinetic slot
but thunderlord is exotic
YUP I'M DUMB
*hammerhead
hahaha yeah
"ammo economy would be kind of a pain though, with 2 specials"
"at that point I would question why threat level, borealis, and hammerhead wouldnt be better"
i am getting the first parts of my PC next week!!
I know I'm the last to do this but last week I finally got my two main chars to 700!
I only have 1 character at 700😂
"Grinding is a wee bit boring, though I did tke your advice!"
Wish I had more story content to grind for power though
Something else you can do is buy the exotics from xur on your max level character for other class and that's a decent boost as well
"Oh yeah that helped so much, especially with the timely gwisin vest sell!"
Let's see if we have people interested in raiding over the weekend
"I should be able to. Can't do tonight, but could probably do tomorrow"
That's number 2.
Mountaintop and NF next.
Lots of people farming for mountaintop last week during mayhem
Did you play comp today?
Pretty much all day
Same for yesterday too
How awful was it?
I mean I didn't think it was horrible? I'm sitting at about 2700
The worst part is the nade spam
Oof
With suppressor and skip nades it basically becomes a game of who has more of them
I still need 4 more resets and 8 more comp games for redrix
Might just wait out this week maybe
I'd go for it honestly
Embrace the spam
"When you don't really care for if you're getting specific kills (solar or hand cannon headshots), its somewhat entertaining"
"I don't have a high level titan, so what's a warlock/hunter strat?"
!pvp
Warlock would be arcbolt nades on top tree storm for the arc web
Hunter is shinobus vow with skip nades
Alright I'll try those tonight and report back!
Alternate warlock strat is contraverse holds or nezarac's sin and middle tree nova for the handheld supernova
Ohh yeah contraverse I forgot about that
I'd argue that the Handheld is the far better idea because of the insane 1-shot range
Oh yeah handheld was my jam for a while until nova warp got nerfed
Also oath you have 3 resets already this season?!!‽? Dang dude
.......I play too much PvP.
"Haha I understand, it's fun!"
You have a 26 game winning spree! That's incredible!
That was me just messing around with some friends
"Also how do you get 40 kills in a match lol, the other team had a real bad day"
If I remember correctly we were playing control like it was clash (not capping any flags) and just slaying out
1: Luck
2: Aim was especially good that day
Bloody heck
Also anytime I see someone someone bring a sniper into crucible I know they mean business
"Eh, not every sniper is that great"
Occasional good shots but everyone can hit them
I mean my greatest sniper strat was when I killed 3 people using whisper in rumble
"When you see a few hundred kills on a snipe, be a little afraid. When you see over 1k, be afraid. When you see anything more than 3k, be very fucking scared"
Yeah that just sounds spooky
I just pulled oem
You're a crucible god now
Go get a We Ran
With a very good roll for you Oath
YOu're not allowed to play crucible anymore
OH FOR FUCKS SAKES
SR reserves and Remote connection
WHY
WHY DO I STILL NOT HAVE ONE
AND WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE A SNIPER ROLL
"I got hc and SR targeting, remote connection SR reserves and sword reserves"
I'm gonna go scream into something while I continue to not get OEM.
I pulled mine from xur
Right
Tentacle face
Does forsaken stuff in the fated engrams now
"Finally got the arbalest, it's a fun gun!"
"Man, had a pretty busy day today"
I know it's late but is anyone interested in doing scourge tonight?
Any and all raids honestly
I could hop on if we get the people
unfortunately it doesnt look like we do
pants is busy tonight
"oh wait actually, pants might be free soon"
Do we have two more?
Maybe @Jokon or @Matos ?
"last two weeks, haven;'t won a single gambit match due to pugs"
don't know if i can keep this up
What!
Damn
"Yup, people still don't know what to do. don't feel like logging in anymore to keep banging my head against a wall"
Gambit or prime?
"mostly prime, with some regular gambit in there"
any raids before reset?
"Unfortunately I'm busy getting settled into a new apartment, but I can try to get on if we have the people"
We can try Niobe labs again if we don't have enough people for the full raid
Hey guys is it double valor this week?
Perfect time to grind for redrix then! Will it triple on the weekends like last time?
I would guess so. It has almost every other iron banner
good luck dealing with the grenade spamming
Oh yeah I forgot about that
Sigh
Atleast it'll make my solo shattered throne attempts slightly more bearable
"Well yeah, but on triple Valor a loss is the same as a win normally"
but any quests that lose progress in the crucible can easily skyrocket downward. VERY quickly
Is it a full curse week?
Those are definitely a lost cause this week. Just run a character that doesn't have it
"Hey FYI with avengers being out some places, it might be a good idea to opt out of *at least* local chat for the time being"
If you want to avoid spoliers
we have a strict ban on spoilers for the movie so you don't have anything to worry about. if we see anything being posted we'll make sure to take it down. but if you want to be extra safe at least until you see the movie...you can always mute everything else haha.
Yeah I got spoiled to heck and beyond by reddit's 4chan sub so be careful about those as well
oof...sorry to hear :( I've been on a social media cleanse all week so far until sunday when i see it haha.
I was slightly careful but they were on the reddit front page and had massive spoiler filled flairs. Pricks.
yeah that sucks. honestly can't believe this really is the end of an era tho 😩😭 lol
@thegoaliebear I was mostly talking about the ingame chat we have on PC cause I know some people here have their settings set to auto opt in
sure thing. just covering all the bases aha. gonna post with the xbox side too.
Hey so anyone down for grinding some shattered throne this week?
I finally have 3 characters maxed out and I'd really *really* like the ship now lol
you ready now?
Oh yeah I can log in now give me a minute
Luna's and NF being nerfed/changed
!!!!
Newest TWAB is out
"whoa, what?"
That's illegal
http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47793
Being changed to a 150rpm archetype and Mag Howl only activates on bodyshot
Hmm I'm not sure how much of a nerf that is but it's cool that they're listening to players
"Also they confirmed triple valour starting tomorrow, so maybe I can get a couple of resets out of it"
It's a nerf alright
Going from a 0.67s TTK to a 0.80s TTK nerfs them hard
"Besides, the 150 archetype 3 taps to the head, this only allows for a 2head/1body kill"
So that's one more bodyshot
Atleast they didn't hit the range
If they hit the range there wouldn't be a reason to use Lunas
It barely outranges TLW right now
I very rarely see NFs so this is probably hitting only the best players
Whoa really? I only use TLW against close range shotgunners
For range Ace seems pretty good
"Really, all this might do is push more players to Ace"
Ace is defacto the best hand cannon in the game
Does Ace outrange Lunas/NF
"About the same as NF, maybe a little more"
Oh wow
Ace also has High Cal which flinches people hard
And has Memento Mori
Yeah the Ace flinch makes snipers/scouts veyr hard to use
Does memento mori work with the warlock reload boots?
"Ace is probably one the best guns in the game period, both in PvE and PvP"
"Basically, what this is doing is making the Magnificent Howl perk much less worth it"
I was gonna grind for NF but now I'm hesitant I think
Just doesn't seem worth it when I can use other guns that will have more power over it
Do you just need to get to legend?
5500 and get 300 Lunas kills
It's a bragging right more than anything I feel like. Best proof that you're amazing at the game!
I mean not really
People are cheesing their way to it
Cheesing all the way to legend?
"Win-trading, getting 300 kills in a few games"
"Using VPNs along with some other connection tricks to match the same team over and over again, and you just win trade to get it"
I know you said people can do that till fabled but till legend is something else
I see lots of people on twitch saying lunas/NF carry
"There's an entire set of discord servers for it, along with a channel on the massive LFG discord just for that reason"
Funnily enough I saw one saying Trials flawless carry
Man Bungie should really shut that down
Are there aimbots and stuff too?
Like in CS
There's one guy for sure
"He's been known for a while though, dunno why Bungie hasn't done something, that or he's just got a great gaming chair"
The thing for me is that changing the archetype to a 150 means that you can trade a kill with someone using a 150
"Sure, you can 2h/1b them but if they're good they can still 3h you at the same speed, which is a trade"
I know sunshot and midnight coup are 150 but I've *never* tried them in PvP
They're not the best
150s are in a weird spot
"Sunshot has bad recoil and no ammo, Midnight Coup is a PvE hand cannon, doesn't have the range for PvP, Jack Queen King 3 isn't a random roll and has an *okay* perk set, Waking Vigil is hard to get a good roll, and any other 150s are just forgotten in my mind"
I know only a quarter of those
"Well, most of those cannot be random rolled and only three I think are considered viable in PvP"
"JQK3, Dire Promise, and Waking Vigil"
Dang
Wonder if they'll play around with the nerfs then
It's Bungie
I have less faith with each passing day
Maybe keep it at 180 and shift range or handling or something
Have they added any map since forsaken?
The maps are pretty and all but it gets boring fast
Only like one
I wish they'd have some more in the leviathan
What are the best handcannon maps?
All of them
Hand cannons are viable on just about every map with maybe the exception of Equinox and Vostok
But even then you can play ranges well and still be successful with them
"hey all, sorry for going dark lately, still busy setting up the new apartment"
there's no internet here yet :((
Oh no!!!
"any raids this weekend? i need the eggs from LW, almost done eggs/bones"
I think you can get all eggs but one from Last Wish by inputting the codes
"Also, I'm down for a raid!"
The only one you can't get with  the codes is the one between the ogre and vault
You would still need someone to start it from the beginning each time to make the wishes for the eggs and the jumps; easier just to do in 1 raid in my opinion
Does last wish not have the reset button on it?
Finally finished all the iron banner bounties
Got a reset and a half with it
Holy hell guys
Xur just gave me one eyed mask
"Whoa, did you join Team Titan?"
Levelling up my  titan
it is complete!
I'll be making the switch 100% to PC when D3 comes out...still got another year of D2 left on my console life😩
"You *could* make the switch now. They've got the power surge bounties, so it won't be as hard to catch up"
haha yeahhhh but i also have one more year of college...and i low key don't want to bring it there especially since I'm away from my apt a lot for games.
I've also come too far with my characters on console. gotta finish up the era hahaha
Hey guys I really need to do a couple of shattered throne runs
Anyone down tonight or tomorrow?
yea i tried solo-ing it with the tonic and shield spam
"still annoying, so i'm down to run two runs tomorrow"
Alright perfect!
Yeah soloing is still an ordeal damn
"if i didn't play a titan, it would be much easier"
But the infinite shield throw today in reckoning feels so good!!!
I had no idea what I was missing!
"I'm not 700 yet on titan though, sigh"
Finally have *Cursebreaker*!
Thanks @Thawxtem !
Did you do your STs?
Yeah one hunter run
I still want to do it once more on my titan anyway
"Ron, congrats!!!! 👌"
Sorry I didn't see this sooner
I should be getting internet installed tomorrow
Can't wait to get back online haha
Honestly the revelry made it so much easier!
Trying to solo ST on my titan right now
You got this!!
finally got internet back 🙏
i feel so free
I can watch netflix and youtube and play video games again haha
Welcome to the modern world!
"thank you, thank you, it truly is incredible"
"Alright so I'm still kinda new to Titan, but what's the loadout to do massive boss DPS? Something equivalent to blade barrage/nighthawk golden gun or nova bomb/chaos reach?"
Cause it's taking me way too long to kill high HP targets and shield throw spam is not the most reliable
Oh to do boss damage I usually use melting point and then full auto shotgun
or thunder Lord or 1k or something else
I'm not too sure for sentinel
but I don't think sentinel has good single target dps
"Ron, Titan has nothing equivalent to Blade barrage/slowva/chaos reach."
That’s part of the issue right now. Titans strength is in pvp and add clear.
That's kinda bad
(understatement)
Ok which one was melting point again? hammer Strike?
Top tree sun breaker.
"Perfect, thanks! I quite like using Hallowfire heart and the sunspots for essentially infinite abilities"
That’s the siege build. Viable in add clear.
"I want the khepri's horn exotic, apparently you can kill just using the barricade!"
it looks cool thats for sure
Finally got my Titan to 700!
"For the first time, I have all chars to max power."
Honestly the grinding was way less annoying than I had feared
😮 nice!!!
So do you guys want to try Niobe labs this weekend again?
"Sure, I'm down"
We got so far last time!
(♪and tried so hard♫)
Petra's Run done! Need the sparrow and a couple other challenges for Rivensbane
Congrats!!! You're almost there!
praying rng is kind to you with the sparrow lol 🙏🙏🙏
I regret not doing any shattered throne runs last week cause all I need is the ship
"I ran it so many times, finally got it on my hunter, thanks to @Thawxtem essentially soloing Dul Incaru"
There's a 20% chance of drop every major encounter I think
"Ari, I’m in the same boat. My Destiny motivation is at an all time low."
"Depending if people are free, maybe we can get a raid going this weekend?"
Oh yeah for sure!
I could join a raid team for tonight or Sunday
Anyone else interested in raiding tonight? @PC
"Sure, what time though?"
Depends when people are free! maybe around 8 CT?
That sounds about ok with me
Maybe push it another 30 ~ 45 mins if possible
"Yeah, sure"
Let's see if we have enough people first
im definitely up for an attempt
What raid?
I'm down for Scourge or Last Wish
Can maybe join
Sounds like we have 6 then right!
I can do whatever a little later.
Assuming anybody else winds up not being able to make it.
"okay, sweet"
Just let me know. I'll be home within 15 minutes of 8pm
"I'll be a backup if you need one, feeling kinda tired tonight so might be getting some sleep early"
"Ofc, no pressure at all, go get some rest!"
I wonder if @Matos and @Thawxtem are free ?
"yea I'm free, you guys forming?"
Getting on
"awesome, will you join us @TheCnC ?"
he needs like 15ish minutes
Might take that long for me to get ready anyway
Driving home as we speak.
joining Raid VC
I am here and in game!
ALright I'll be online in like 5 mins
@Oathbreaker My PC has DERPED very hard and it's currently scanning and repairing.  They are on the last gauntlet if you wanted to still go help them.  It may take me a few minutes for the game to repair.
It hated that I was running the right way I guess.
"Yeah, I can sub in"
Give me a moment guys
My bar is only 50% full atm.  I can come back in once it's done if you would prefer to have me replace you when it's done.
"Sounds good, when it gets close to completion just let me know and we can swap out"
Ok it just finished
Let me just make sure it boots properly lol
"Hahaha, all good"
Ok it seems ok
Sorry to bother you lol
Hopefully it holds for you guys
No problems lmao
Guys this would be a great weekend to do Niobe labs with the revelry buff
"Oh yeah, true"
We don't have a third though
Maybe someone here wants to join in?
Niobe labs does not seem very fun.
Just quickly looked it up.
Yeah but think of the bragging rights!!1!
What time were you guys thinking?
"I'm free for the evening, more or  less"
What is Niobe labs anyway? I still haven’t run into it
"It was an activity intended to open up the Bergusia Forge during the Black Armory DLC, unfortunately Bungie made it a little hard for the community to solve and it actually took longer than most raids did to solve"
So Bungie opened up the Forge early instead of making the community wait
Some of the puzzles were way too convoluted
Understatement of the year
"Guys if you have any reveler's essence remaining , remember to turn them in for eva's gifts!"
I got around 25-ish masterwork cores from doing that
"Oh shit, yeah I have about 600..."
Should probably do that
New exotic quest! Yay!
wait what???
HOLY CRAPPPP
NO WAY!!!!
THAT'S CRAZYYY
"An amazing new exotic pulse, won't spoil"
just googled it
I'm starting this right now!!!!
is it hard to get ????
Nah but apparently the last mission is 690 and hard!
Probably should fireteam up if possible
"yeah, lets do it together"
I'm about to start the quest as soon as I get in
i want to do this like NOW
want to fireteam up?
Yup yyup
starting destiny now
im in the voice chat
Oh noo I didn't update
well it
s short
give me like 2 minutes
ofc take your time
ill wait for u to start the quest
Is the first step solo?
i dont think so
it's just a heroic adventure
we can do it together
Ooh then I'm joining up on you
im just sitting there rn
i'm also in the voice channel if u want to join
Oh yeah oops
I'll be on in asec
@Trissin you guys can keep Goin apparently I have the longest windows update ever to do
18 percent!
I’ll be on sometime tonight to work towards it.
let me in if you guys get an opening!
Join in thaxterm!
to trissin!
"in middle of Heroic, just got beginning item"
Alright we'll be in the farm
final boss
It's gonna take all my willpower not to get distracted and check the internet for solutions
Never!
"so I watched some PvP gameplay of the gun, it looks strong"
"most importantly, it MAKES THE SOUND"
the perk from d1
On uhhh
Ex machina sniper
"""wait for it"" perk"
That sound is soooo goood
Like all those wotm weapon perk sounds
SO did you guys get it?
I'm ready again whenever
We didn't
aww
Feel like trying again?
"love to, 1 minute"
Cool do we have a third?
I see ari is in gambit
Or @Matos did you get it?
im out now
good to go
Does anyone else want to run Zero hour?
We need +1!!!
hopping back on
I just got let out of class
"Gonna go home, eat, and log on"
Yeah we're still trying
I'll let you know when I'm good
Got it!

||Alright so apparently to get the time trial emblem you have to complete it with at least 5 minutes on the clock. People are saying there is a pretty easy chees to do it though:  https://redd.it/blzmm3||
we can do it!
"I am super ready to do the heroic catalyst as well, did you get it?"
"got the gun, haven't attempted heroic yet"
oh it feels SO GOOD
just like d1
It has like NO RECOIL
Absolutely shreds majors
"performance? yeah it's good.
more importantly the S O U N D"
the wrath of the machine weapon sound that i've missed so much
"Haha I'm glad you like it, the game needed a cool mystery!"
it did
but honestly im just really happy with the way it feels to use
and i really just cannot get over the little sound effect
_brrrrt dvvvt_
||Oh and there is a ship quest by the way||
w h a t
"Yeah it's such a cool gun, probably the best sounding one after the graviton lance"
||https://clips.twitch.tv/DiligentHyperRadicchioTF2John||
graviton lance ew
whoaaaa
oh my god there's still so much to discover
||here's a thread with the links: https://twitter.com/AyyItsChevy/status/1125894970324529158||
do I dare to click that?
Sure don't open it unless you're ready though
Guys go talk to the drifter if you've completed the ||zero hours exotic quest||
Hey @Trissin do you want to try for the catalyst tonight?
"oh actually i just finished the heroic version! but im happy to run others thru it, absolutely"
Oh yeah I'm down around a few hours from now
I'm definitely down if you need a third
I’ll be around to do a heroic run. Still need to watch a video in the route though.
Oh oops sorry!
"||I think that the keycards have been found, and I think I saw a post on reddit of someone who opened the vaults for 7 rooms, each with 7 siva particulate, but I am not sure||"
"||Ooh cool, can't wait to atleast get the catalyst soon||"
hey @Oathbreaker have you had a chance for it yet?
Not yet
Holy cow guys I had the best gambit game of my life
And I finally got Dredgen
I will never play gambit in my life ever again
😮 congrats!!!!!
thats awesome
Hey so anyone wants to do the heroic version?
Are we trying the exotic catalyst again tonight?
I'm fixing to go gambit prime if you care to join
"Sure I'll log in, giv eme 5 mins"
I've got 36 minutes to complete a match for a bounty
"was just doing a heroic in a pug, got halfway through and servers went down"
well at least i know the heroic path
We can do it this evening then!
After they've fixed the other quest as well
I’ll be around for a heroic run and to do the void puzzle.
We need one more!
Need to do normal first
Otherwise I'd be game
"I can do normal a couple of times for sure, trying to get the time trial"
It'll be super fast
(Also doing it blind the first time with trissin and ari was amazing!)
"I finish classes at 11 CT, not sure if you guys will still be on but  I will be free to help out then"
I'll probably be on then sure
🙌
I think i'm going to try and complete it within the first 24 hours this time
hopefully earn a cool emblem
Lw and sotp are locked until worlds first
"yes, I saw"
i'm ready to grind out 3 characters
"get as high as I can, and then see if I can complete it on day 1"
I *should* have that day off
"i'm kind of upset its not friday though, that works way better for me..."
Would love to attempt it but I'm in Scotland till the 8th
"For the first week, there's usually a jacket reward, isn't there?"
"Till reset, yeah"
Heck yeah I'm down
"also, i want to do the ||void configuration|| tonight, if people will join me"
Yes for sure
If you guys want to help me do the normal version I will probably be available for the heroic and configuration but if someone else wants in they can have priority
We can do one normal for @Thawxtem and  @Oathbreaker as well I think
Oh yeah I can run normal on my hunter as well maybe with @Oathbreaker
"It won't unlock the heroic on your hunter, it's bugged right now"
But can I do the normal?
"You can, but it won't drop the gun or unlock heroic, just so you're aware"
"I'd prefer doing the heroic on my warlock for sure, platforming is so much easier if I can just float above for so long"
Oh not even the gun?
"Yeah, that's the bug. It doesn't drop on secondary characters right now"
Huh
Anyway I'm down for all the versions wheneve rpeople are ready
cool. ill be home in like 4.5 hours lol
"Ok the gun does insane damage, you can literally one phase insurrection prime if you stack buffs correctly"
Oh I saw that this morning lol
"I need to do some Reckoning, and then I was hoping to do a quick SOTP before trying the quest for the weapon. Anyone willing to be a reliable team for one or both?"
When were u thinking?
"I'm getting on now, Reckoning is whenever I get a team together, and SOTP is similar, though I'm willing to set more of a time on the raid"
I just chose it over LW because it's faster
Farming for power
I'll be free at ~11:30 ct
"Just @ me when you guys are gonna do a normal run, I won't be up too late but I can spare some time"
@Thawxtem You are high enough for an easy normal run right now I think
god these gambit games
Oh no what happened
"just can't do it, highest primeval damage, most motes deposited, most enemies killed and i have paste eaters on my team"
5 rounds today all losses
just getting tired of this shit
and the rng behind unlocking titles
"I feel bad for you, maybe LFG teams?"
Yeah the RNG is really bad
What's missing for yo?
third reset and protect the runner
"Reset should be easier this week, just stock up on bounties for the grind to legend"
But protect the runner is impossible without a fireteam
"@Matos I was thinking about doing some Gambit, care for a team member?"
hopped off for now
i'll be on tomorrow and all weekend
* YEAH! Got powered up Black Talon sword from Ascendant Challenge!!
"THat's a excellent weapon, devastating in PvP"
"btw, I'm 690 now. If we could find a 3rd, would you try the quest again tonight?"
"Sure, if oath or trissin wants to"
Around 30 ish mins from now
(for me)
Alright
Getting a little late for me unfortunately
i just got home
logging on now
let me know when you guys are good to go
Alright I'm logigng in now
We can do one normal for @Thawxtem and then the heroic and then the secret
finally got the catalyst after many pugs
now just the void configuration puzzle
Oh wow congrats!
i'll wait for you guys to do that
"I still haven't gotten mine, looking to do that and the void quest tonight"
"^
need to do void config"
you going to be online tonight Trissin?
"Yep, yeah"
I'll be on soon
Do you have time to run one heroic before doing the void puzzle?
"sure, np"
Cool I'm down then!
Hopefully I won't spend 15 minutes on the jump puzzle again
alright ill be on in a couple mins @Matos @RonInDune
Alright i'm just finishg up this week's xur mission
You guys willing to run heroic with me afterwards?
"sure, so long as we get the void configuration completed"
@Matos ?
i'm here
im trying to get ron and thawxtem through heroic righ tnow
sorry @Matos we just fijnished lol

i'll be around tomorrow for void configuration
I looked it up and it looks confusing.
"dont worry, it's not actually that hard."
"for us at least, all the hard work has been done by the r/raidsecrets community"
to actually solve the puzzle and stuff
we just read their guides lol
Yeah we did it first time and it felt super simple
We're standing on the shoulders of giants and all that
So when are we running the void config for matos?
hey
i'm going to eat dinner in the next 10 mins then i'm down for it whenever you guys are
I'm down whenever
i wonder if its possible to do a raid today
"I'd love to,  do we have enough people though?"
i'm done eating
@PC any interest in a raid today or tomorrow?
Yeah maybe
Got some time maybe tomorrow but I dunno
Just had my internet drop guys so I'm gonna try to get that fixed
"yeah, ofc!"
Hmm.... looks like there's just a big outage for my ISP so dunno if I'll be back
At least according to their website
"I'd be interested in a raid, but it would be a later one"
there are a bunch of us online right now.... almost enough for a raid 👀
I'm super ready
@Oathbreaker care to join us?
What raid were you guys thinking? I don't have a lot of time*
i was thinking scourge
but we can do whatever
I'd be in for a scourge run
hey @Matos still up?
buddy asked for some help on path >__>
ooo how long is it gonna be?
@Matos
not sure at the moment
"if you have a 6th, go ahead since i don't want to keep you guys waiting"
you are our 6th lol
should we LFG for one more?
"yea, sorry guys"
its all good
if i finish and you're looking i'll let you guys know when i'm done
Hey @Trissin are we raiding again tonight?
"If we are, I don’t get off until 9 tonight (this message posted at 2:27 for time zone conversions)"
I should be able to swing that
"I'm ready whenever, if we're doing it. Just ping me"
Anyone for gambit prime?
just need protect the runner and I have dredgen
what are the requirements to unlock?
"In gambit, one person had to bank 100 notes without losing any and you have to win."
Queenbreaker- check
Anybody up for helping through heroic and void configuration later on?
"yeah, sure"
Sweeet
How hard is the heroic routing? I know I got up to the ||wall with the pipes and stuff||
"That's almost the end of the different route. There's ||a slide, a room with some pipes, and then it's back to the fans and the normal route after that.||"
Wouldn't mind getting involved in a run of that myself
Need to do it at some point
normal or heroic ?
Heroic
Need to get the catalyst and do the configuration
ah gotcha
so same as ari
Yeee
It'll be Whisper all over again Ari 😂
So do you have to have the catalyst and then beat it again for the progress on the catalyst?
wait I don't think so
WAIT
No you don't
I'm just stupid don't mind me
Gotta do the puzzle separately though
"So the first run will be catalyst, second config?"
Or is the config a bounty you can turn in after getting the catalyst?
I don't think you can turn it in after catalyst but I could be wrong
"The config is like a separate objective within the heroic mission, you have to pick it up and complete it during the run. You don't need to kill the boss and actually complete the mission but you have to get to the vault at the end and do a puzzle"
"the puzzle will give you time though, so its not like you have to get there with like 10 minutes remaining or something"
"OK, I had just seen something about a bounty so I wasn't sure if it stayed in your inventory"
How rough is the configuration to learn?
"I don't think RaidSecrets has cracked it yet, they just brute forced the puzzle lmao"
"Well, let me know if you guys are logging on and need any help, i'm sure @RonInDune is happy to help as well!"
"Yeah, whenever you guys get on I'll log in, just let me know"
I'm not sure when I'll be on
"I was reading for the puzzle, which was apparently one of the harder parts. So if you need, I’d be willing to help"
Who wants in?
heroic zero hour?
Who else?
It would make sense for you to do it with @Arixama
Catalyst obtained
Now just for the Void Config
nice!
"For reference, this is the map that we used:"
https://i.imgur.com/9tEQBqC.jpg
And it's perfect for the job
finally got my EP sniper
We got 6 people on
Do we want to finish Scourge?
@Matos @RonInDune scourge?
"Just finished work, on my way home. Could you wait a minute?"
"yep, no problem. If we have 7, someone should take my spot"
Honestly I could dip out if necessary
nono its all good
"I was about to log out anyway, and having you in would be more useful than not"
You sure you don't want to try and get your Anarchy before me?
oh i've already cleared it this week haha
Oh
Oops lmao
"hey @Matos , can you join us for scourge?"
i wasn't really feeling like a raid right now
its just the last boss?
"yea sure, that won't take long"
I have Chronicler!
Gratz!
Thank you guys!
Couldn't have done it without you all patiently leading me through the egg collection in Shattered Throne and the raid
I was also able to abuse Destiny bugs for the first time and got the 2 lore today that I'm only supposed to get one for in the DC
Nice!!!
Do that once more and the main things holding me back will be the lore on Tangled shore heroic week and gambit lore
"Tangled shore lore is now a guaranteed drop, so that's much easier than before when it was like 2% per"
But the gambit one is tough yeah
I thought it was only available during the week Tangled shore was flashpoint
Oh yeah only then
Iron Banana anyone?
||Arc week solutions for Outbreak prime: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJqjJhbvw2mUF70_h-rUq4ImIuA_TXEJxvZP8kGcwEY/htmlview?sle=true#gid=926558894||
"Oooh it's shotgun week in EP, will definitely need to grind for that!"
i think it's everything week
I was under the impression it was everything week as well
"huh you're right, the guide I was following was wrong"
||https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/bolom9/arc_configuration_data_pad_is_located_in_the_same/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share||
Guys anyone down for doing the arc puzzle tonight?
"i am, but i'll be home kinda late
like around 11:30 CT again"
Yeah that's fine with me
Takes no longwr than 20 mins anywau
I should still be up.
Im also down for it
"if anyone wants to try it now, I'm down"
I just got back
a bit earlier than expected
People want to do arc configuration and heroic?
don't really know what to do but im availible
lol no worries. it's not hard
you've completed heroic before right?
did void the other day but i didnt really do much to help
"lol no problem, its all good"
ill finish this iron banner match
then im ready
ok im done
lol that was fast
the game was like half over and we got mercy ruled soo
Here's the arc infographic:
https://i.imgur.com/hgbpJXI.png
"awesome, ty"
i believe that the ||fire room path|| has changed as well
also we are in the voice channel

"Alright so I found a really intense levelling up guide for the new season, to gear up as fast as possible for crown of sorrows:"
||https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wa86FNc-5oMpF79lL27M-_ZDgqMG3P0gGwuldLHPCVo/edit#gid=0||
Yeah that guide is legit
"That's from Sweatsicle, dude in Redeem"
Ah that's the clan who won the race last time right?
"If someone wants to hard grind for the raid, *that* is the guide to follow"
With glad and datto
and the rest
Datto raids with Math Class
Gladd sticks with Redeem for World Firsts
oh oops sorry
is that the teawrex clan or am I confusing them again?
Pretty sure it was Tier 1 that won Scourge?
Think Teawrex is My Dad is Bungie?
also that's a funny clan name
Why I know all this I have no clue lol
ALmost as good as ours
"But yeah i think Gigz, Riot, and some of the other T1 guys were worlds first on Scourge"
Nah this is fun! When I was really into DOTA 2 I knew so much stuff about the teams and such
Redeem was Worlds First for Last Wish
Oh that's the one I remember them from
Redeem holds like 5 or 6 WFs across D1 and D2
They're some of the craziest PvE players period
Has it been the same people?
Well they won't get it this time
'cause WIPE's taking the throne now!!!1!!1
Wish I could raid day 1
In Scotland though for like 4 days after launch
"I mean really, what's more important, taking a long needed and deserved vacation or playing a video game?"
The answer is obviously video games
I don't exactly have a way to play 😂
I hear android emulation has a come a long way
"Yes, let me just run Destiny 2 on my LG G6 lmao"
Invent a new branch of computers to play the game
yeah that's the guide i've been following haha
lol rip Indica
also I've actually queued into games with some cool people before! i've played gambit against t1 riot  and some of his guys (they absolutely destroyed us) and i've also raided with conquer and sneakybeaver before
woah
"yeah, they're good lol"
conquer is really really good haha
"So I haven't been around much, the allegence quest kinda broke me, but I'm back in the paint now. Hit me up if you need an extra pair of boots for pretty much anything."
Sorry @Trissin I fell asleep before you or on last night.
Going to go for my arc config tonight.
"Sam! welcome back haha, glad to hear it @Samakain"
"also no worries at all @Matos , no need to apologize lol
let me know if you need any help for your arc config"
will you be around this evening @Trissin ?
@Trissin up for arc config with ari and I?
Oh no the nerfs are too much
what nerfs?
Maybe I'll finally start using DARCI
This Week at Bungie just dropped
"Whisper got hit super hard, as did all super generating exotics"
Here: ||https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47823||
WHAAAT
Rip Whisper
"I think they wanted people to use more weapons, but it's still kinda sad"
Maybe outbreak will be the new boss DPS queen
seems that way but only if everyone has one i believe
well its already better than any primary and most powers
until its hit like everything else
I think whisper works similarly to the D1 gun now right? The black hammer?
black spindle
and yea
but snipers were better all around in d1 compared to d2
Hmm maybe this is a hint more exotic snipers are coming
that would be nice
Oh man people are real mad about the change
"I expect whisper to be moved to special soon, honestly"
Oooh that's something I hadn't considered
It kinda feels like their moving it in that direction
THen we need more exotic/heavy snipers
Izanagi is kinetic
"Nah, we just need better heavy exotics."
Also I would love to run whisper/lmg
at this point id prefer a good hammerhead to almost any heavy exotic
jotunn is king
all hail
Oh yeah jotunn and graviton lance are probably my fave exotics till date
It's so satisfying
I gotta get me delirium. I'm so close
Oh yeah delirium feels like infinite ammo sometimes
204 clip with overflow
Need 57 more envoy kills and a reset
how many total is it
350 envoys and a reset
Plus some number of multikills
You can check in the destiny app
i just saw all this right now
wow
that's quite a lot
"i'm really glad, though, i think whisper was too strong"
but now i think it's too weak
"I'm mean really, whisper is still viable as a damage phase weapon, but outbreak is already becoming preferred"
why use whisper if its just a high impact sniper
outbreak will get nerfed as well
in the heavy slot
it must
Probably not super hard for like a year
yeah they'll keep it around for a bit at least
"It's a power squish. They want to entice people to use more stuff, and especially the new stuff."
which will all be op probably
beyblades will be exciting
Plus they have 2 weeks to have community feedback and adjust if they feel the need.
What
darkdrinker
isn't that the spin to win sword
I never got dark drinker
Sounds like it though
"i wonder what other weapons we will see, i did also hear that hawkmoon might be coming back"
another exotic hand cannon quest inbound lol
>___>
as someone who never played D1 i dont see the apeal in hawkmoon
it was a boring gun
for boring people
who got lucky from time to time
thats basicly what i got from it
don't @ me
I will be annoyed if dark drinker has a quest similar to d1
oh god
I mean it would be an actual reason to go get planetary mats
i dont want to go through that grind again
Huh I just read up on Hawkmoon it's quite an unique concept
How high was the random bullet damage?
Good for PvP
If the drop rate for the rarer materials is similar to what they were in year one it wouldnt be as bad.
Anyone up for playing some crucible tonight? Iron banner/quickplay/comp whatever
ill probably be down
just know im not too good at pvp
Oh man neither am I
Maybe our powers combined the results will be better
@RonInDune i'm available now
alright joining up on you
im not quite loaded in yet
for whatever reason my game takes a million years to open
Yeah same with me
Think it needs an SSD
Rumble counts as quick play for this week's invitation
Ooh that s a good tip thanks
I'm genuinely dreading the 6 comp games though
Isn't it 3?
Yeah should only be 3
"Not that it'll change much, with it being comp"
"I do things on 2 chars, so 3+3 for me"
Yeah that would do it
Man I need to grab some popcorn for this show. The subreddit has completely melted down. Bungee still hasn’t learned about optics.
"If they are buffing stuff, throw that in there with the nerfs."
oof yeah it's absolutely hilarious honestly
The meta has been stale anyways. I’m okay with changes.
I was looking up good perspective about this on youtube and there are a surprising lot of people who support this move
"^
I agree!"
Because it makes sense. A lot of people are just children in adult bodies these days.
"I love having to work with new guns and new exotics, makes things more interesting"
I predict the next most powerful exotic to be the aeon cultists stuff
"I’m still using a year 1 gun with exotics from year 1 and it’s almost year three (midnight coup, thunderlord and whisper)."
And wardcliff.
Outbreak and jotunn are nice surprises.
"True, jotunn is the only ""new"" exotic that has truly taken off"
though was the blue laser gun from year 1?
forgot its name.
Cold heart?
"Honestly, right now unless they bring out something that looks better, I'm gunna keep running skull no matter how they nerf it"
"^
same with ursas"
Are they reducing phoenix protocol or geomags as well?
"Also, Xur is selling Ursa today so get it if you need it!"
Boy do I hate this
what?
The way crucible is today
i hope they get it right in d3
Honestly like it was just awful cause every one was out with shotties and recluse and the games just felt like they were dragging on
Games dragging on is the common theme these days and I don't know why
"Shotguns are still causing some issues but they'll always be the easiest weapon to use special ammo wise, and recluse continues to just be stupid incarnate as a gun"
Anyone willing to help me with Arc Zero Hour heroic later tonight?
"I'm grinding out strikes for Service Revolver, should really have done this sooner"
I'll probably be in for that in the next few days
i just started going after that not too long ago im like 2 bounties away
"Yeah, got like 28 more strikes to go"
Slow going and boring lol
might be easier in the new season when you actually get powerful gear from it tho
That's for Nightshade
i'm talking the Hand Cannon from Zavala for 40 strike completions
oh i thought it said bounties lol
All good hahaha
"service revolver is pretty fun, are u looking for like a PvP roll @Oathbreaker ?"
"Of course, it's me hahaha"
I just want an option that isn't Ace/Thorn/TLW
"And seeing as though Mag Howl won't be super viable, I can just use SR with a better roll"
I tried out the default zavala roll in crucible wasn't that good honestly
Yeah there's better rolls out there
"So, I got D1 in today. Anyone know of a good clan there? Or do we have a clan there?"
Well I did my 6 comp matches
"Good news is, I'm no longer stuck in Brave III"
"Wish I'd gone up in rank, but whatever"
Hey @Thawxtem did you get to finish the arc puzzle?
"No, no one would do it with me."
"Oh sorry, I didn't see your message @Thawxtem ! I'll be free tonight if you want to do it then"
If you need someone else I should also be available
anybody for throne?
"Me and @Arixama Both got it on the maze, first ST of the week"
Alright so is it double or triple valour right now?
Triple
Till monday reset
oh wow
Am really trying for the 2 resets I have left
ronin if you want to join me im doing iron banner rn
Curse breaker boiz
@Buttkikker illl join in after this match
ok cool
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i was solo flawless shattered throne up until the END of the wall right before dul incaru
with the little taken blasts
i didnt even get pushed off by a blast
big oooof
warlock jump is the worst AAAAAHHH
vorgeth was okay as long as I played it slow
ohhhh myy goddd i had full heavy and i was ready to wreck dul incaru
warlock glide noooooooo :((((
i floated to like the edge of the platform and just my character did not want to mantle
:(((((
that sucks a lot
"oof yeah sory dude, the destiny gods are fickle"
"yeah. well, who knows whether or not I would have been able to get solo dul incaru on my first try anyways"
damn.
"if you can do vorgeth, you can do dul incaru easily"
:\\   it does kinda seem like that
i think what i hate the most is that i can't like reset the checkpoint now lol
You'll get it next time!

"Probably sooner, but it depends on the bus"
I'm so hyped! Can't wait to see what the ||ship|| looks like
I'm being very careful to not get spolied lol
"you tread a line that is dangerously thin, ron"
"Yeah I was watching Datto and TeaWrex and they were trying to be careful, which is nice"
Haven't gone on reddit at all though
I'm definitely available to do a run
Let's get it!
Perfect! We can knock it all out in one go
@RonInDune we're just about good to go I think

send me a shout when you guys are done. I'd love to finish this as well!
im also avalible
this titan with mountaintop recluse wardcliff and one eyed mask is alot of fun to fight
Damn you can kill morgeth in like 15 seconds using just outbreak
dang
how much glory is fabled?
2100
ok thanks
just hit 1194
Holy cow that was fast
lol yeah
1 rank away!
just hit 2010 glory
im real close now
will the weekly glory boost give me enough?
Congratulations!
Yeah that's what 190 points!
120 points for weekly bonus
goty
ayyy congrats!
anyone down to do heroic zero hour tonight?
I’ll be around for it and to do solar configuration.
If my internet holds up I can join in
yeah hopefully it stops acting up
How late is tonight?
im available now
"I work in 40 minutes, get off 6 hours later"
i should still be up at that point
i'm around
im also here
any takers for solar config and a heroic run?
Heading home anyone still up for Zero Hour tonight?
ye
whoa! Crown of Sorrow world's first update:
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47832
:OOOOO
Good change imo
yeah holy crap
No crazy insane levels of prep for a Day 1 completion
i still had so so much prep to do
I think we in the clan can actually race this time
"i have like a BUNCH of completed bounties sitting on all 3 of my characters right now, guess i won't  need them lol"
I'm gone Day 1 anyways so I wasn't prepping at all lol
I mean keep them
Still useful
yeah of course but just wont provide a huge benefit for the day 1 race
i'm so exicted haha
ALso maybe they'll update the raid weapons to current gen
the year 1 weapons?
Specifically the weapons that Benny D sells
Somehow make midnight coup even better
Also @Trissin they might have done some stealth updates to the mars drop rates
I got 4 unique locations in 4 runs
whaaaattttt?!?!? 😮
"I recently (in the last 2 weeks around?) opened another ~20, still no luck."
"I opened 4 yesterday, all 4 were new"
how many are you missing now?
I'm 36/40
Will try to get the rest now
Let's see if it was just pure dumb luck
"if you get it before me i'll be happy for you
but also >:c"
Haha yeah
It's the 1KV curse
I wouldn't even consider myself lucky on that one! I got it on my 21st run
"which is pretty average, I think"
"oh, i wonder what the new raid exotic will be for crown of sorrow"
i'm so excited now haha
"1kv and anarchy are both really unique weapons that are fun to use, a new hive exotic weapon would be super cool"
Hopefully something completely new
"I imagine it will be, yeah"
I'd also like to see some exotic trailers
"In regards to worlds first race, the power prep is still valid, since you'll be able to be at 720 in the final encounter"
"I guess, yeah"
but it's not as important as before
anyone want to do some EP?
I'm on level 7 now
Got the shotgun!!!!!
Never doing EP ever again
"I got trench barrel and moving target, is that a fixed roll?"
WOndering if I should masterwork it
Honestly it's good for ba machine gun frames
"It's, y1 it's fixed."
But I can pretend
"Would you reconsider EP? Next week is strictly shotgun week, and it’s the last EP weapon I need"
"Also, anyone up for Zero Hour tonight?"
😦 opened 10 more but still didn't get it
I probably just got extraordinarily lucky
Friendly reminder:
!xur
"For any titans still missing it, lol."
yay one eyed for all
fuuuuun
"AKA me, probably the one guy still missing it"
Good roll for me too
So I will not be around for day 1 raid.
Oh no!
Wasn't aware it was going to be launching later in the day. I've got my bachelor party that day
"Woah, congrats"
Please don’t have me wait until the last minute again this week- is anyone willing to do the final Zero Hour(s) tonight in about 8 hours with me?
I'll try!
I should be around for a last minute run *tonight*
Not on Monday
"Just logged in, ready whenever"
same
i'm around for heroic and solar config
Cool! join the fireteam chat and I'll tell you when I'm done with this quest. then we all join up and finish Outbreak!
@Matos waiting on you
"If you guys want, here's the infographic I use:||https://i.imgur.com/lz7cIrT.png||"
"next season starts this tuesday, right?"
The 4th
"This Tuesday is the last reset of the season, then next Tuesday is opulence"
Also starting next Tuesday 3x infamy
"So this might be a dumb question, but power level/actual level does not matter in comp right?"
"Not a dumb question, I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter"
I think it's only Iron Banner and gambit in which power matters for pvp
Ah thanks
I had a couple of comp games last time I played where I got wrecked with some dude in a level 20 with a not forgotten
who would be interested in some  scourge of the past?
"Sure, when were u thinking?"
i should be available whenever
so mostly whenever other people are able
"Sure, let's see if we can get a run going tonight. Others interested in scourge? @PC"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4AoVUamhxo
ooh
"@Trissin @Buttkikker I'd be interested in scourge. Granted, I'm still learning some seeing as I've been more focused on memorizing Last Wish."
so i think i am going to pick up the base game with CoO and Warmind today just to experience D2 in high fps lol.
Why not just get the version of forsaken that comes with all of them?
well I'm only gonna be taking my PS4 back to college and with Penumbra out soon i really won't be playing it that much on PC.
What's the price difference on them?
$39.99 for the forsaken and my local gamestop has the base D2+expansions for $12 aha
That makes way more sense 🤣
hahaha yeah i thought about getting the forsaken one but when i saw the price on the base i was like...yeah
"wow, so my gamestop had the forsaken legendary collection for 29.99...worth."
Even better
for real...it was 59.99 on Blizzard website...that bonkers
Is that the one with the annual pass too?
nope. the one with annual pass is 79.99 on Blizzard.
love to see it LOL.
i can play destiny on my phone guys
the service that ive been using to basically rent a pc rig some where
has a mobile app
i have an xbox controller bluetoothed to my phone and im using that to literally play destiny on my phone
"lol I thought you were joking at first, that's pretty wack"
oh my god those notifications are giving me anxiety
😂 i just got off of work
@here I'll likely start some D2 tomorrow on PC. if any of yall wanna add me my bnet is goaliebear#1614. not sure if I'll look to do endgame stuff since I'll have to get back to PS4 soon for Penumbra but if anyone feels like joining me as i play through the stories again lol feel free to lmk. would be happy to play with you guys since I'll be switching to PC completely for D3.
is anyone able to help me and a friend do zero hour? He needs to do normal and the heroic puzzle
Literally just got home. You hoping to do it now?
well be able to in like ten minuets
also is everyone ok with me inviting him to the server?
"@Buttkikker no problem, we can get him set up with the roles."
well discord is broken rn and cant seem to generate server invite links so ill have to get him in at a later date
"try this one @Buttkikker 

https://discord.gg/jBQ5VV"
yup thank you
So which exotic weapon do you guys thing this is?
Something completely new?
||TRUTH!!!!||
Oooh is that a ||rocket launcher||
||Exotic from d1||
||yep!!||
Very cool!
||one of the actual D1 exotics I have 🤣||
||And the other one is also a returning weapon?||
||it was fun in PvP||
oh I haven't seen that one before
||In PvP!!!|| Interesting
I am very excited
Me too!!
||also heard rumors about necrochasm returning but not sure yet||
"From what I've heard, ||they showed dark drinker and hawkmoon in the trailer they put out too||"
"||I saw hawkmoon, but not dd||"
"Does anyone still need EP shotgun this week? also, what was the warmind strike that gave an exclusive weapon?"
"Strange Terrain, for braytech osprey"
I can grind EP with you on the weekend if needed.
I just wish they dropped resonant stems
I still have so much prep to do before the dlc
"Also, ||apparently parts of the leviathan got Taken or something||"
"Not sure if others are interested, but here is a power leveling guide:

https://i.imgur.com/q7S5VO0.jpg"
Oh I saw that in the trailer
that will be pretty interesting
"I'm gunna be honest, there's no reason not to just fully have the blind well bounty done."
Doesn't doing the blind well give you a powerful?
Not the bounty. It gives you powerful on your first completion of the week.
"It counts towards the weekly bounty completions which give powerful gear, but the bounty itself just gives you baryon boughs and and offering"
I think the reason the bounty is 50% because you should do a tier 4 clear for the powerful anyways
so you dont really need to do two completions to prep
"Also previous Flashpoint won't award powerful gear unless they are the Flashpoint that week, unless they changed it."
Just watched the trailer || what people are saying is dark drinker is definitely enternitys edge||
Oooh ||what weapon is that?||
||year one warlock sword||
Them Titan boots are back. Hopefully they buff thunder crash.
I'm also not convinced that ||it is actually hawkmoon||
It’s not. The subreddit has images of the new gear and a HC has the same model.
It still *could* be
Cause It definitely looks like it
But there also a shotgun with the same barrel style
"Hmm, ||looking closer at the new weapon ""Lumina"", it looks like there's thorns sticking out of it. Wonder if it's related to the Malfeasance||"
"||With the bud at the bottom of the handle and the actual shape of the gun, it's more likely to have to do with Rose||"
Ok I've been watching some ||truth videos and it's absolutely insane||
LOOOL
||Like what the heck! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTk2_MBYFGA&feature=youtu.be||
"Also that's  such a cool map, and I have no idea what's going on there"
@Oathbreaker can tell you all about it
"||With the direction they've been taking the story in regards to shin malphur, the shadows of Yor and everything else, and with a gun coming up that heavily looks like it could be the Rose, I'm really hoping we're going to get lore on Rezyl Azzir||"
That hand cannon looks dope. But will probably collect dust in the vault.
Why even waste vault space on it?
Oh also someone one reddit linked the high res photos from the press kit: ||https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rijm9xhz53922di/AAA8UTY4abe2a2-1BBR1oMuEa/Destiny%202%20AP%20Season%20of%20Opulence?dl=0||
How the hell
Do you spoiler tag on mobile
|| in front and after message
|test|
try two of them
||test||
There we go
"||Fucking Truth man, the amount of rocket powered bullshittery you could do with that thing is insane||"
||Also Trissin were you referring to the map I could elaborate on or Truth itself?||
i was talking about rift
RIFT
WAS THE MOST FUCKING FUN MODE
I MISS IT DEARLY
BUNGO GIVE RIFT
It was fun and it makes me sad that it's gone
Literally reverse CTF
But it was so fun
"You could spawn kill for days though, really wasn't designed with spawn protection in mind"
"Oh man wonder why they removed it then, it sounds fun!"
Also looked very confusing from the video
Basically they tried to replicate it with Breakthrough but we all know how well implemented Breakthrough was....
breakthrough oof
"Not super confusing, go to neutral location, pick thing up, run to opponents side of the map"
There were some really fucking cool strats too
6 man Bubble Titans building a Bubble train to flag dropoff lmao
"I saw the ||truth rocket projectile follow a guy for half the map, that was kinda broken||"
||There's videos out there of Truth rockets tracking the person who fired the rocket around the entire map to kill them||
||Or the person they're locked onto||
"But the rift map looked so epic, wonder why they didn't bring it back for normal PvP"
Vertigo was fun but unbalanced
It also suffered from being on Mercury and having your eyes blinded by the Sun
Oh man I love this new helmet
"Here's another clip of the || ~~new~~ _returning_ exotic Truth with it's crazy tracking|| :

||https://youtu.be/Q0ztOk_E5D4||"
||thats just a mortar||
Anyone excited for the new pinnacle weapons?? I'm looking forward to the ||gambit bow||
"||I'm interested in the Crucible Sniper, if that thing has snapshot I'll be 1800 the day I get back, I though I saw an Ambush scope||"
They don't sound too great compared to past ones
Probably stick to my delirium and breakneck
I wonder how much ||blast radius and damage the grenade launcher gets from picking up orbs||
"||If that Sniper is a 140, has snapshot and an Ambush scope I'll never use anything else every again. Ambush was my favorite low zoom scope period||"
The Grenade launcher is the only one that really catches my eye.
"I hope || the bow has atleast 
 two of explosive head/dragonfly/rampage, otherwise it'll be completely useless in gambit||"
"actually im not sure about explosive head, because that reduces precision damage"
huh I never realized that
"yeah, a bow with explosive head does less damage compared to a bow without explosive head on precision hits"
it will do more on body shots though
"I noticed recently that explosive shots flinches people hard in crucible, though I suppose that doesn't help in PvE"
One thing I wish got buffed was the dragonfly explosions in crucible
They should kill!
Also did anyone see the latest Death Stranding trailer? It's kinda weird.
Is there anyone here who is willing to help me with a Gambit achievement (and possible lose a lot)?
Explosive rounds/arrows do guaranteed bodyshot damage that ignores falloff but otherwise does less damage than a regular bullet/arrow
what do you need @Thawxtem ?
I need to swipe 3 motes from the other side
Ohh that one took me a while too
playing Hunter Nightstalker
"My suggestion, go in as a invis hunter or ultra defensive titan"
Ah ok that's the best choice
Put on the invis helmets and just sneak around and steal the motes and then hide
So no one here?
I can jump in later tonight
"ill play some gambit, sure"
I'm down for some gambit as well.  And if anyone wants to help me grab my outbreak later I'd appreciate it.
@Samakain I'd be happy to help with both. Are you good at invading? I need an invader for Malfesance since I'm terrible at that one role
"oh yeah, im down to help with outbreak @Samakain"
^^ that too. I kinda like the quest now. It's fun to me.
"I will let someone else go if they don't have it yet, though, since I would be helping for fun"
"I am an egar invader, with varying amounts of compedence 😛"
"yeah, just realized I need to kill a lot as invader, crossing my fingers that I can somehow kill all 4"
can't cheese it with only teammate kills
Run bottom tree dawnblade
"Honestly i got that mainly through  lucky nova bomb, didn't have much to do with skill. It took me a while and was pretty frustrating."
That it also good advice.
It's got the seeking bolts
"I'm playing gambit now, I'll try that. thanks"
twab is out
the chalice seems really cool
it'll probably take the destiny community like _at least_ 2 minutes to ||probably brute force all the rune combinations to get exactly what you want lol||
also a lot more info on the pinnacle weapons!!!
"@Oathbreaker ||you called it, revoker has the special low-zoom ambush on it||"
||also this season's PVP pinnacle doesn't need you to hit a certain competitive rank!! only acquire points!||
||IT BETTER HAVE FUCKING SNAPSHOT BUNGIE||
||Oh? Interesting move. I kind of like that||
||IF THEY GIVE ME A FUCKING LOW ZOOM SNIPER WITHOUT SNAPSHOT OR QUICKDRAW I WILL SMASH MY HEAD INTO A WALL||
Does the GL have spike grenades?
||OR USE THE REVOKER WITH OBSIDIAN ASPECTS||
looks like swords got buffed overall
**ooooh i like that crown of sorrow emblem**
im going to finish it in the first 24
it might kill me but im gonna do it
"OMG THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE WE NEEDED.

THE TOAST EMOTE NOW LETS YOU SIT FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT, INSTEAD OF KICKING YOU OFF THE CHAIR"
"**seems like they also fixed the bug where you apply shaders, ornaments, etc. but it wouldnt apply**"
im so excited holy crap
||IT. HAS. SNAPSHOT. PRAISE BUNGO FOR ONCE HOLY FUCK.||
||GOODBYE TWILIGHT OATH HELLO REVOKER||
"||AMBUSH WAS MY FAVORITE FUCKING SIGHT IN ALL OF D1. IT'S GONNA BE A GOOD FUCKING DAY. I DON'T EVEN CARE IF IT'S A 72RPM. IT'S A LOW ZOOM, SNAPSHOT SNIPER. NO CRAZY HOOPS EITHER, JUST 3500 COMP POINTS TOTAL WHICH IS NO DIFFICULT FEAT. BACK TO BEING MASOCHISTIC WHEN I GET BACK FROM SCOTLAND||"
Oh cripes the 24 hour emblem look sooo goood
right?!?!?!? ahhhh i want it so bad
confirmed hive themed raid?
"Not sure about confirmed, but it _really_ seems like it. The emblem, **""sorrow""**, and the lack of a hive raid for a _long_ time are good indicators"
Oh man this weeks MOTW is the greatest
The TR3-VR Perfected one
Oooh they're adding catalysts!
Oh they're finally adding the faction rally catalysts back in
Trials is next 🤣
THAT SWORD BUFF THOUGH 😍😍😍
"finally, my first title"
"Heck yeah dude, congrats!"
got my taken sparrow too!
close to a few other titles
"Dang , nice!!"
Got my Two-Tailed Fox tonight!
!!! lots of good stuff!
congrats!
Also finished Malfesance.
"You could've waited a couple of days though, to get a powerful reward at the start of the season"
^^^^
"Deal is, I thought I had to go through a special strike or something. I remember doing it with Helatia"
I believe the strike is towards the begging of the quest . But it does feel like it should be at the end i made that mistake too
Strike is like step 2
I've got 3 says to get 2 gambit resets. Is it possible?
pick up all bounties on toons every day
triple infamy
and hope you get a good streak
Going for the ghost shell?
Yeah. Just need that and protect the runner for dredge
"Damn, good luck!"
I just need the ghost shell but I don't think I'm going to be bothered to chase it
protect the runner....
"Protect the runner is still 100,isn't it?"
Actually I think it was made easier
Oh my god it's only 75 now
I'm not sure if that's actually easier though. Just more balanced.
Ari why do you always leave the resets stuff until the very end of a season??
"OK, last season it was because they didn't do the double triple Valor boost on the last iron banner like they did for every single other one we've had"
qw56yhn;l.
lol my bird got on my keyboard
"I'd watch a stream of Bird Plays Destiny, set to the Seinfeld soundtrack"
This was probably the longest grind in Destiny so far:
oh nice
!!! congrats!!!!
My first crucible pinnacle!!!
Now what are the odds of going from 868 glory to 2100 before the reset
depends on how much you grind mostly
but i think you could do it
I'll try then! What can possible go wrong...
I'm definitely not getting 2 more infamy resets
if you want i can help im just unsure if my rank would mess with the matchmaking
"Also I won a couple of rumble matches using nothing but a trace rifle, so I'm obviously a crucible god now"
Haven't even made it home from work yet.
"@Buttkikker I think it probably would, but maybe next season when everyone is playing again might be easier"
yeah probably
I definitely want to try for 2100 next season
I'll tag along with you then Ari
"Plus, the new one is like 3500 or something cumulative points?"
I think so? I'm not sure if losses subtract from that or what
for the new sniper losses wont subtract
That's perfect!
If it's good in PvE I might even use it
i kinda doubt it
seems very crucible oriented
@RonInDune you got a link for where all the lore things are?
This is the one I used: ||https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9ewfs0/all_available_dead_ghosts_lootable_lore_triumphs/||
Have any of you guys heard the creepy voices in the EDZ before? Like this one from reddit: https://youtu.be/gMVzYXFgwps?t=20
Spooky!
"No, I haven't! Wow"
"If I worked at Bungie, I would start putting random savanthun whispers in certain places and add in hive ritual stuff in key locations."
That would be horrifying
Creep people out! The deep will consume us!
I remember they did that in the F.E.A.R. games and it scared me so much that I never never completed the 2nd game
I love fear! The Hive are great fodder for stuff like that.
hellblade did a super good job using whispers for all its gameplay
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47849
Ohhhhh dang
I am so ready
Also wait what's owl sector?
https://www.destinypedia.com/Owl_Sector
Oooh thanks
Was a precursor to rise of iron and all the siva stuff in D1 apparently
"So Bungie just put me into a game of crucible, and as soon as I load in, I hear ""I've seen enough, I'm calling this one"" and I lose my winstreak"
You shouldn't lose your winstreak if you get matched midgame though?
That's weird
oh wait really?
hold on
still a loss on record but whatevs
W/L is dumb anyways
I've got like a 62% W/L overall
But individually for clash and control in QP I'm over like 70% or something ridiculous
Do they have individual matchmaking for the game modes?
"Yeah so 62% overall, with Control being 70.7% and Clash being 80%, only way I can work it out is it also factors in IB which would be 61.5% for me"
"No, but most of the tracking sites track individual game types as well as playlists"
"No, but the DestinyTracker website can sort by individual modes"
Hold on I'll link my page as an example
https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/pc/Oathbreaker-11137
i wonder what my profile says
Mine is just a giant banner that say SUBPAR
https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/pc/matos-1219
look at that gambit
whats up
"*Ewwwww Gambit*

Kinda joking not really?"
Gambit is the greatest thing Bungie has done since Halo reach
refreshing and new multiplayer mode
Hard disagree from me but I respect that take
"Definitely can be fun, I just don't find that enjoyment in it"
Give me 6 other guardians to step in a ring with and I'm a happy (mostly) man
"if crucible was more like d1, i would care more about d2 pvp. so i'm glad they added something outside of pve"
"the big thing is d1 had better maps, where are the d1 maps?"
and the dunking game mode
that map with the train in the middle and open areas on the side
The one from Y3?
i think it came with taken king
"Also, yeah, D1 maps are far better"
"Oh, on Earth?"
"I think we just need to get oath in gambit with a good team. Solo queues are just always a crap shoot, and feels a lot like year 1 d1 pvp in terms of matchmaking."
i mostly solo queued my three resets this season
and it was brutal sometimes
don't recommend
"I just find that Gambit is too centered around invading, and you can get utterly fucked by having no heavy drop while the other team has heavy ammo pinatas 24/7"
"Because there's only four players on a team, theres a huge margin for error, and communication makes a load of difference."
"Great idea, execution has fallen a little flat IMO"
heavy is exclusive to invaders then sentries until primeval stage
"The beta test for it, along with the initial stages were absolutely fun"
there is always one brick that spawns just before first portal goes up
so the invader gets that one
I think having a fallen/taken armaments on your invader breaks the game a bit
_Several people are typing_...
"I'm talking gambit in general, not just prime"
"With heavy ammo finders and armament mods, heavy ammo economy is way better"
"^
Im not sure, heavy ammo finder doesn't seem to do anything for me"
"prime is the better version of gambit, regular gambit isn't worth the time i feel"
Parcel of Stardust disagrees with you
I'm still playing regular gambit to get the 25 thorn kills for the triumph
"well as @Arixama knows how I feel, heavy ammo is busted in D2 because they set up the entire game to have that modifier for ammo"
Another core problem with D2 which makes me impatient for D3
I want Ruin Wings
Heavy needs to be tuned
"I tend to try and only run a single finder, and save heavy for primeval damage"
Like in Crucible if you don't have heavy you can just get run over
I find that as long as you give invader all the guaranteed heavys your good
"But wait, the place you want for map control is away from heavy and if you go to get it your blueberries will inevitably fuck up defending the spot you want control over"
"I do really like the roles the brought in for prime, because that adds in more concrete roles in regular gambit as well."
But having invader be a heavy-centric meta is a little stupid IMO
with outbreak you dont need heavy anyway
I mean I just don't like heavy in PvP encounters so I'm biased with regards to that
but thats if you even want to use it
pvp playlist with no heavy and supers?
too much for bungie
PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE
GIVE ME THAT MODE AND I WILL NEVER NOT PLAY IT
"Oath, you need to get in a gambit match with Matos. He's a good invader out of necessity."
"That requires playing gambit :)

I'll play it at some point during the new season but it's not my priority tbh. I want that fucking ||Revoker||."
Did you guys catch the Halo reach PC gameplay?
"I was surprised at how familiar the movement looked, coming from destiny"
Oh God Halo Reach on PC will be glorious
Halo on PC in general will be so good
"I mean, can you imagine being able to go through a campaign with three other people?"
Oh lord just give me the multiplayer
I tried Splitgate and it just was too Halo to the point I wanted to play halo on PC
yea i'm always down for gambit and Ari is right. I'm an invader because pugs suck and i just started doing it because no one else would or would be bad at it
Boy do I need the machinist mission
Also gotta go for that 3 mote triumph
Is there anyone here who isn't in a group for the new raid that would like to be?
My group of 5 is missing 1
"Hey all, just for anyone that's wondering, I am joining another clan **temporarily** for the Crown of Sorrow raid team that I'm a part of"
WOW
are you fucking kidding me
"Just so on day 1, our levelling groups will all be contributing clan XP and we will get clan rewards, so more powerful gear"
scum
bag
move
THE BETRAYAL
titan dad betrayal
well guys I am the titan in charge now
THE STAB IN THE BACK
"All hail @Matos , titan of titans"
Matos is *specifically* level a warlock because of how let down he is
I appreciate the support Ron
here I thought trissin was our captain america
turns out he is the winter soldier
"Went all ""Hail Hydra"" on us"
😈
endgame spoilers beware
"""hey Trissin, you want to raid with the guild you run and have led for awhile?"""
oh no not like this
WOW TRISSIN
I SEE HOW IT IS
Comic book spoilers:
||Captain America really is a Hydra agent||
||*Only in the storyline where his history has been altered by the infinity stones*||
https://youtu.be/ApER9xG--LE
Hype levels increasing.
the armor looks great. hunter is basically reskin prodigal set lmao but...still looks sick.
"Another one of those transmission looking things, may be raid spoilery so I'm gonna tag it below. Read at your own discretion.

||http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47850||"
yeah i think it might give away what the boss is.
"Yeah, exactly why I tagged it. Little borderline for me so I'd rather be on the side of caution"
Oooh ||that dude looks exactly like the councilors we'd punch in Levi||
||I don't think that Gahlran is gonna be a true Psion. Maybe a Psion hybrid with something else?||
||Like Mewtwo vs Mew maybe||
||Kind of. Psion mixed with a Acolyte or Knight perhaps?||
Dang that'd be cool
||Destiny Go app when????||
God I'm getting the itch to play in scrims again. Can't wait to get back to my PC and be playing Crucible again
I hate this itch yet I can't escape it lmao
Take inspiration from Ari and start playing on your phone
whoa where is that screenshot from @RonInDune ?
Levi throne room
I highly doubt I can do scrims on a phone lol
Yeah on the top right plate
i guess i never looked at the councilors up close
You never know until you try!
They're fancy Psions
Don't have a controller to do so hahaha
That'd make for an interesting challenge though
Something like Solo Shattered Throne on a phone
That would be ridiculous lmao
I suppose if it were possible one of those youtubers would have done it already
Kackis?
Or wait no esoterrick
Kackis would get stuck on saying his intro
I don't think Esoterrick has tried to do something like that
Man I wish we'd managed to finish Niobe Labs
I want to try that at some point
Me @Trissin and @danny gave it a good try a couple of times
Got to the very last stage but couldn't finish
Maybe now with outbreak it'd be easier
So I just heard some ambient dialog from Ana Bray that might be reference to the raid?
you just ______ some dialog?
She said ||Rasputin detected a lot of Guardian traffic at a place called the weep. The strange part is no bullets were fired.||
interesting!!
||Maybe that's  a location in the raid?||
Is the weep somewhere on the leviathan maybe?
That's be pretty cool!
No that is a faction rally reference.
When people would run in and out of that lost sector on earth.
"ohhh that's a lost sector, duh"
I'm dumb
there's a lost sector called the weep?
"Oh trissin I finally got the frigid jackal, I'm just the nightfall weapon away from wayfarer"
nice!! i'll be on the lookout for strange terrain
let me know if you need a hand farming it
"I don't think it'd be worth equipping over ""chronicler"" or ""cursebreaker"", but still a cool seal to have!"
Yeah the weep is in winding cove right as drop down
ohh that one
I'm also two nodes away lol
From the final
:ooooooo
"still haven't gotten mine, lol"
i made 5 more frequencies yesterday
It's such an annoying grind
_indeed_
what do you get out of it?
Is there atleast an emblem for completing?
Peace of mind mostly
"there is an emblem, yeah"
warminded
Oh dang okay that's a cool emblem
That makes up for it
kinda
I'm still at 38/40 after literally over a year. i just gave up lmao.
i've been at 39/40 for about a year now as well
i'm just not letting rng get the best of me anymore lol. nearly quit the game after months of needing 1kv for Rivensbane.
hoping with this seasons title they get rid of all that rng crap for it.
how many runs????
@thegoaliebear
Have they fixed the RNG in the titles in the new titles?
probably not @RonInDune
39. not nearly as many as others have. but it was awful.
@RonInDune they haven't. Reckoner still requires rng drops from the reckoning. it's bs.
i won't be needing the warminded emblem after i get this one:
ahh so hyped!!!
haha well good luck. hope you guys get the day 1 clear.
That is such a cool emblem darn
You can do it!
I'll be rooting for ya
"ty, you as well! been prepping like crazy"
I did the entire quest for the last word again yesterday ( _oh god so much pvp help_ )
hoping rng is kind to me with milestone drops tomorrow lol.
After finishing the redrix grind I don't to do PvP anymore for a bit
Is it just me or is CoS being significantly more hyped than Scourge?
definitly
"I think people are just a lot more excited in general, yeah"
Because it's been a while since a hive raid
plus scourge is a little underwhelming
"^^^
that"
scourge was cleared not even 2 hours after release
THat last hive raid the one where they killed Oryx right?
I've been watching a Destiny 1 LP to brush up on the story and that expansion was pretty cool
"yeah, that's the one"
definitely super interesting
They had a special ammo auto rifle in that one I think
"from what I'm seeing, crown of sorrow was designed by the same people who came out with spire"
"for reference, only 19 teams beat spire day one"
Oooh so it'll be mechanics heavy and tough as heck
I hope so!!
"the sandbox challenge is definitely going to be pretty significant, people can't level like crazy"
Yup it'll be a true test of communication and skill
Trissin does the nightshade pulse quest drop as powerful?
"I don't think it drops as a powerful reward, but it's at your current power level"
so it could be useful
Then no need to rush the bounties then thanks
Does the whisper drop as powerful?
Then I might run it
"I don't think so, only the exotics released in/after forsaken"
So outbreak would?
"outbreak should, yeah"
I also think I have the thunderlord quest half completed on one character
@Trissin Last word is not that bad of a quest
Thorn is the worse out of those two
"Yeah, youre right - thorn is a lot longer. But still, I'm not a huge fan of PVP so it felt tedious to play so much pvp and get all the medals and stuff again"
the ace of spades quest went by a lot faster than I expected
fun fact
my titan will be 700 before i have all three forsaken super fully unlocked
my warlock still hasnt finished nova warp lol
i literally just need a helmet
and then 700
i still have the full commander tre to unlock pretty much
holy crap these resist mods are ridiculous
Did you get one?
i did
trying to get more
I saw the drop rates being ridiculously low and decided against it
Dang congrats
I just got here and I'm busy/lazy. what we talkin 'bout?
You can get Major/Boss resist mods from the armour drops in the reckoning
Which are fairly useful since they give give a flat damage resistance stat
I've gone through about 80 synths now i think
chaos reach is a lot of fun
So it is!
"I wish it were a bit easier to see the screen when it's activated, but that's a minor concern"
i'm still hoping for thunderblast buffs
or titan pve buffs
700 on characters
Remember to get the xur exotic if you haven't already
still not done with the code of commander 😂
Do Blind well! That's how I completed all the subtrees
@Trissin have you unlocked the forges on all your charcters?
"I have not, only volundr"
"But that's enough, because it allows access to ringing nail and hammerhead"
"ok, cause if you hadnt, the volundr unlock frame doesnt go away at reset so it would just take an ignition"
"Oh, I see"
Any suggestions for getting the 21% delirium?
I know quite a few people here have it
I'm at 75% on envoy/primevil kills. thats all im missing
@Matos got it quickest amongst us
How many more do you need? It's like 350 total
All I did was play regular gambit
oh my god 350?
does that mean I have like 80 envoy kills left or something
You should be able to check on the destiny app
It give the actual number values for the triumph
from what I've observed it's 1% for an envoy kill and 2% for a primevil kill
"I'd almost suggest running normal gambit with tractor cannon honestly. Potential for six envoys in a match, all with void shields."
Plus 1 to 2 primeval kills
if you're not in a team normal gambit is best. if you're with a team prime is better to just farm envoy kills there.
"Oh, all good suggestions, ty!"
Content day guys (least where I am) good luck and I'm rooting for you guys!
Thanks oath!
When are you back?
We'll run through crown
Saturday late
I'm gonna try and pick up a blind run at some point in the week following
"Guys Jason Schrier and Kotaku has massive spoilers for the next season locations and names and stuff, so be wary"
"It all stuff data mined from the patch, basically the pre-order page for next expansiom"
Oh they buffed Aeon Soul! I am a prophet!
@Trissin Would you be able to invite me to the clan?
"@Buttkikker DM me your Bungie account name and all that, I'll look into if I can get you invited if Trissin hasn't already done so, especially if he's done that temporary leaving to get a more raid focused temporary one"
"Trissin, just so you know when you do eventually look at Discord again, I've invited him into the clan and we're all good."
"Awesome, thanks Oath"
appreciate it
"Not a problem dude, keep up the grind. Kick some ass and good luck to your group!"
Good luck everyone @PC who's attempting the raid!
I certainly hope @Arixama  isn't attempting the raid tonight. 😛
"I'm so glad I'm not, I'd feel like I'd be unreliable cause it is currently raining super hard and the tornado sirens are Goin off"
It'll be done in about an hour it looks like.
Dang that'd be the perfect ambience
"Massive wall cloud is slamming us now, then shortly after you, then dissipating it seems judging by the radar."
Run stormcaller
Yo I didn't expect the skull nerf to be SO HARD
ikr
Disappointed in you guys.
No one told me about THE JOTUNN BUFF
there's a jotunn buff?
10%
"On some things, in the patch notes on the subreddit."
Toaster meta!
Wow that took a long time
Almost 5 hours
i'm pretty sure they fixed heavy ammo finder
Holy crap really?
gatdang
i have it on almost eveyr piece because i didn't know it was busted
"today, purple bricks are raining from the sky"
in every activity i do
So Esoterickk got it
hope any of you guys doing the raid are going well :) we got the first encounter down on PS4.
My team is still on the final boss
You got this!
Progress is slow but we're getting there
thanks ron!
BTW what's the raid exotic??
yeah good luck!
im SO CURIOUS
ty buttkikker!
good luck to you as well @thegoaliebear !
'Tarrabah'
what is it???
:oooo
exotic smg
what the heck???
in what slot?
and what does it do??
energy
guessing it's void
And it stores up damage when dealing or receiving damage
😮 interesting!!!
no it's solar I think
I forgot
Datto was super salty and deleted it
what???
datto got it?!? i thought he was 2nd
He though he was first cause the gun dropped for him
But he was like a couple of minutes
late
ONly 5 completions so far?
"Hey @Trissin , would you be willing to help my group when you guys finish?"
Not sure how long we'll be here!
Still stuck on final boss rn
it's pretty tough
"it is, but poeple have two phased using mountaintop"
our team doesn't have mountaintop 😦
ive got until about 10 tommorow so about 12 hours
3 phase using outbreak then?
thats what we're trying but we'll see
gotta get back now
to focus
Good luck!
@Trissin you guys get it done or called it a night after a while?
still going :((( our first team broke apart
now i'm with 1 guy from my original team and 4 randos
damn...hope you guys get it. take breaks tho ik yall wanna get it done but make sure you're taking care of yourselves too that's a long time!
"haha indeed, thanks!"
holy crap. only 7 hours left
"i know that sounds weird, _only 7 hours left_, but holy jesus this raid is SO HARD"
the final boss is actually ridiculous
you guys can do it!
"ty!! our group is just chilling right now, one of them is at starbucks"
that's good. hoping yall get through it aha. it has been a looong time lol.
it has haha
Good luck Trissin. I believe dude
Am I insane or did they change how orbs of light look?
they look like the solstice orbs just not elemental colored lol.
"Like theyve got like a weird tinge of darkness around the edge sometimes, right?"
Post a picture
i'm so nervous... only like 4 hours left
"@Trissin you're at final, right?"
we've been at final FOREVER
do you mind if... I biggyback and get the checkpoint for my group?
don't stress. you can do it🔥
haven't finished encounter 1 yet
we got to the final boss when only like 2 or 3 people had it cleared!
@Thawxtem do you guys have the mechanics of the first encounter down?
we understand them but werent able to complete it
"yes, just trial and error with very low light"
the sandbox challenge is pretty rough
"people have to be on top of ads, or else those acolytes with the boomers will MELT your team"
"the large ogres as well, they have to go down immediately"
"I think the main difficulty in the final encounter is really just sandbox challenge, the knights can kill you in like half a second"
yeah being underleveled is the worst part. you can understand everything but if you just die to adds so easily it.makes it unnecessarily frustrating
"The group I was with had the mechanics down perfectly, and everybody knew what they had to do and what needed to be done"
We just couldn't execute it
I've played with SO many people in the last 15 ish hours
haha i can imagine. that was how we were with Last Wish. we had a lot of trouble at riven with execution even tho we knew exactly what to do. but eventually everything just clicks and you get it done.
you just need the ONE run of it😜🔥
Is DIM broken for anyone else right now?
I just logged in for teh first time since Monday and everything is either super slow or not loading at all
I do not like the location of the pursuits tab
I fucking hate it. Goof ball move by bungie.
I dno't understand it at all
"Like,the seperate tab is great. Should be in the character/inventory, not director"
Difficult to get to
Difficult to parse information
I'm itching to get home now
Someone already has Revoker
"It's so weird, Bungie usually has great UI/UX"
And it looks absolutely disgusting in the best of terms
Oh yeah a youtuber has it
I sawa  recommended video
CammyCakes used it with a Fusion rifle and still did well
Granted that's Cammy
But Jesus I want it
With a fusion?
But you wouldn't have ammo
Loaded Question
2x fusion finder for the fusion
And if he missed a snipe then for the most part it would get refunded
You could do some stupid shit like Revoker Jotunn honestly
Or Revoker/Shotgun
"And as an additional statement: Fuck it, I'm gonna try and get NF this season"
May cost me my sanity getting to Legend
But I have held that gun as my endgame goal for months
"Considering how effecting the mountaintop seems to be in PvE, I might focus on that and recluse this season"
Mountaintop is also something that I want to finish off
Recluse will be stupid good as usual
Yeah most teams just used mountaintop for boss dps in the raid and absolutely dumpstered everything
weird
Because it's really good honestly
It's just a grind slower than the slowest boat to China in the 1700s or some other comparable century
I feel like if I could survive redrix without going insane I might be able to do mountaintop
It's a lot of grenade launcher stuff
"Well I'm working on the prospector catalyst, might kill two birds with one stone"
did you guys get it @Trissin
no :((((((((
im so sad
"aww sorry 😦 well, you made it further than like...most people in the world haha. i'm sure you'll finish it this week tho."
haha maybe
"I don't want to sound like an ass or anything, but i 100% think that the day one completion is not terribly difficult. What made it hard was people playing aggressively, and not being used to being underlevelled"
"However, because it's so easy to slip up, make a small mistake, and die, that causes teammates to have to cover - and then the team structure collapses and nobody is able to complete their responsibilities"
at least that's what I've noticed
a lot of people play too aggressively with shotguns and SMG's when they should be playing more passively for their life
"oh definitely. pretty much all of us were running outbreak/shotgun/hammerhead last night, using our supers often, and it worked out great. there's no reason to get up close to adds when you'll literally die in two shots to like, an acolyte haha."
yeah  haha
"i also feel like, when you're learning the mechanics or if you have the mechanics already down, it doesn't make sense to hold your super. i see people do that all the time like holding supers for dps and it's like...just use your super if you feel you might die because then the group won't even get to dps lol."
"and like definitely I made mistakes and bad decisions as well, but my death count was relatively low and was rarely due to a tactical mistake"
also i completely agree with u goal
right. sometimes you just get absolutely demolished or some wacky shit happens lol...but i hate when people keep dying from things that are relatively easy to prevent...like being too aggressive when they shouldn't aha.
^^^^ times like a bajillion
aaaahhhhhh
i ran into that stuff so much when i did sherpa runs in D1 lolol.
hahahaha
"ah well. there are a lot of players better than I am who didn't earn the emblem, and I got to play with a lot of cool people."
it was a fun grind
and definitely a REALLY cool raid
Guys did you notice weird crystals in the xur strike?
the xur strike?
They're undamageable
Yeah on Mars
what's the xur strike??
The one where you kill xul
Sorry I meant xol
Too many x-names
oh yeahhh i noticed that the other day.
maybe you can hit them with the valkyrie ?
ohh what interesting
I tried multiple times
didn't work
Also the valkyrie seemed to hit a ceiling right before the crystals
might just be my aim
might have to go do that strike again to see what that's all about haha.
seems like it could have something to do with the Rose quest or bad juju (if that gun really is coming back).
Oooh
Also there are lore peices scattered all around the menagerie
Are there any changes in the main Levi raid?
Oh the one eyed mask ornament looks cool and the synthoceps ornament is freaking amazing
doubt levi had any changes.
with a 5 minute timer after menagerie I was expecting there to be stuff haha.
Oh man the new hunter exotic is too creepy to use
"hey @thegoaliebear , spoiler for the reveal in the next ~2 hours but ||I heard there is gonna be crosssave between platforms, or something like that||"
@Trissin all except ps4 LOL
OMG WJAT
haha yeah apparently Sony is being really stubborn about it.
"oh jk i guess they're still working with Sony and it seems PS4 will have cross save. so, that'll be nice in september to be able to save my characters onto PC."
HYPE
Oof so much details
Raid in the ||Black Garden!!!|| New ||Finishing moves for each class!!!||
HOLY CRAP
Although ||no Destiny 3 on the horizon.||
||Destiny 2: New Light will let us play the first mission from Destiny again I think. Kinda confused on that part||
Game store is up:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/
Also on BungieStore:
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy/Shadowkeep
"seems like D3 is something they haven't decided. if they follow the three year model they've done with the last two games, it would seem like a new game is due next year. but now that they're independent, they can structure that however they want, so maybe they will just go with expansions or maybe they will keep everything we've done but put it as a fresh game."
That is true
"Also, they have a reminder link for transfering our characters from Battle.net to steam:"
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove
Sad that my seemingly chill raid group got super toxic (screaming at everyone but themselves) an hour before time was up
I am so sorry
"on Crown, like before the 24 hr mark?"
Yeah we were on the third encounter
ah 😦 that sucks to hear
I'm so fucking hyped for Shadowkeep
just pre ordered the deluxe
The only thing that I'm remotely worried about will be the F2P maybe allowing for some hackers and other individuals who will make PvP unfun
Ooh I wanted to wait till it was clear about the platforms and such
^^ Yeah I agree with Oath there
I know how weird CS GO got right after the free to play went live
I might do the stupid thing for once and pre-order the collector's edition
Go for it! The collectibles look sick!
I'm gunna do it
"Not gonna lie, haven't really been following the reveal. What's cool/significant?"
moons back
Moon's haunted
"Oh yeah, I saw that in the director lol"
Th ViDoc is fairly informative too
@RonInDune part of me thinks you won't have to pay for each platform. it will likely link everything through your bungie account and you already have Destiny liscence on your PC.
only thing would be Stadia most likely since it's new. you would have to get the liscence on that again.
Yeah but I'm not sure a FPS would work very well on stadia. AssCreed Odyssey was excellent on it but that doesn't really need that much accuracy...
"Counterpoint, I have been playing d2 remotely since March(?)"
yeah I'm not getting stadia lol. i really wouldn't have a use for it.
Oooh they're bringing back ||Discipline/intellect/Strength||
what's that?
Stats from d1
Also apparently in the crucible ||Sturm will one tap people||
I heard Sturm and Drang were getting a boost
"Just looked at a page for pre-ordering the next Destiny; for PC, is it only going to be available through Steam? Will we be unable to purchase it and use the Blizzard launcher?"
Yeah it's leaving the Blizzard launcher completely
But they'll help us transfer
"I don’t have steam, though..."
"I think you might have to get steam, but creating an account is free"
"So except buying Destiny, I won’t have to spend more money?"
"You'll only have to buy the expansion, as well."
I wonder how much clans and all that are going to get hit
"Wait, does that mean two purchases? Nothing for those of us who are just being forced to switch launchers?"
You don't have to buy the stuff you already have
Just the expac
"Okay, that’s what I was trying to ask."
Just wanted to make sure! 😁
anyone here willing to help with t3 reckoning i need 2
I can in a bit
Huh Destiny 2 is already one of the top sellers on Steam
loool what
ok finaly got a group good enough for t3 reckoning
thanks for offering though ron
just need the chest piece
Ah shit
I was running into trash groups so I stopped
we had 3 until the boss
Finally got the full notorious invader set
loool what the heck haha
I went through like five groups that couldn't make it past bridge
Yeah I end up switching from well to nova and back depending on what my group is missing
me and Nahkriin have well and orpheus rigs so we can basically 2 man
up until boss of course
"Yeah well, rigs and nova are essential. A titan is handy with melting point"
"I found menagerie to be far, far easier than t3 reckoning"
luckily there's enough shadow thralls for orpheus to still refill super despite the nerfs
That's perfect
I still haven't done a flawless run of oryx
"Also I haven't opened the steam front page in a while, was it always this full of weird anime pr0n games?"
"No, they just recently started allowing them"
OH MY GOD
JUST AFK DURING BRIDGE AND THEN LEAVE WHEN WE FAIL
THATS COOL
😭😭😭
report them
@Arixama me and Nahkriin can help after this match
Anyone up for LW/SOTP later?
im down for either
Nahkriin would also join us if thats ok
I approved him
still need threat level so badly
@RonInDune @Buttkikker join Raid chat
"Yay, Trissin's back"
The traitor returns...
aka THE TRAITOR
Don’t turn it too much WHEN YOU TAKE THIS KNIFE OUTTA MY BACK
"Alright Trissin, when you carrying the rest of us through the new raid?"
Lol when people are free and want to!
Do we have enough people to try another raid tonight?
"Maybe Last Wish? Or if we're feeling brave, Crown?"
currently i cant even get into the game but id be down to do a raid if blizzard starts working
"Same issue, I can't log in either."
i would be up for last wish if blizzard servers go back up
Oh is there maintenance?
can't wait for the steam transfer...
they are having issues with authentication servers
"Huh, maybe Activision is getting back at them after all the shade in the ViDoc"
I won't be on until tomorrow
I won't be on for the next few days while I recover from the flight home tomorrow
I really hope they get these outages resolved before reset
actually just got in like 15 seconds ago
Awesome
"Any idea when you might be feeling ready @Oathbreaker ? I think you'll like Crown, it's a lot of fun"
We should clear it as a clan
Yes! I'll probably be 720-ish by then so it'll be slightly easier
I'd love to get an attempt in tomorrow if possible.
No clue. Would love to maybe try it blind
"That being said, if there's no blind groups that I can find I'll just read up on mechanics and whatnot and then do a run with you guys"
"Blind is fun, definitely see if you can find a group for that! If not, don't worry too much about reading up on mechanics and whatnot, it's not too complex and I think we can work it out"
We talking eow not too complex? Or more complex than that?
"More complex than eow, but not by too much I think. Really the mechanics aren't hard to understand at all, it's the execution that's challenging"
I think people already one phased the final boss
"There are a lot of things that could go wrong, and it gets hard to recover after people make mistakes"
Haha gladd one phased within the first 24 using mountaintop yeah
I believe yesterday he tried to 2 man it LOL
*oof*
I've heard swords are really good?
"There is a strategy, for one of the encounters, for which swords can be really effective, yes"
Surprisingly effective lol
"Contest mode is over now, right?"
So what are the actual power levels required?
"Enemies are 715, 725, and 735 I believe"
I know the raid itself says 740 recommended
"For the last encounter, I think as long as you are 725+ you'll be fine"
Ah that's doable. Are you past 635 already Trissin?
"No, not quite yet because I've been switching between characters"
"My titan is 729, hunter is 728, warlock is only 716 lol"
If nothing else I'd love to do 3 high score nightfalls for all 3 characters tonight
I'm at 725 without any raid stuff
Gat dang
Remember shattered throne is also powerful gear
"Entering the raid around 715 should be fine, but the last encounter might be a bit hard"
"i'm dragging my ass, my titan is 702. had a very busy week. this weekend i will be doing some milestones"
is anybody lower level? just joined the clan and getting back into the game after a long time
i actually just got the game on PC a couple weeks ago. used the spark thing for my hunter but have fresh titan and warlock.
i play a bit sparingly on pc tho since ps4 is my main platform still. but if you see me on feel free to join up. running through the stuff with someone else is always better aha.
I have a level 26 hunter. Debating on if I should just finish leveling it or not. Forgot how far behind I am on pc
okay cool thanks!
"cool. my hunter is like level 32, so i can run through whatever you need for your hunter. i need more gear lol."
nice sounds good!
I think I'm just going to finish up leveling my hunter and then use my boost on a warlock since on ps4 I had a titan
Welp apparently Gigz has already two manned Gahlran

Has anyone found a map of the menagerie? I want to go lore hunting but I get lost constantly
https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/bwtgjt/secrets_within_the_menagerie/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
"Not a map, but current known lore locations"
"Yeah I just can't seem to find the one in the gauntlet, I have the other 4"
Its off to the side kind of behind one of the pillars
Do we have enough people to do a cos attempt tonight?
Is @Oathbreaker gonna be ready?
Sitting in JFK right now and will be for another 4 hours
"And then add on an hour and a bit flight, with an hour drive home, so basically midnight tonight"
Haven't even touched any content so I'm still 700
Maybe Monday night?
I'll be honest I want to do a blind run first but I don't think I'll be able to find a group by then
We might attempt a Last Wihs then?
I'm good for Last Wish
Maybe try for a Petra's
Yeah flight got delayed again so definitely not gonna be ready
So apparently the best way to get the pinacle grenade launcher is to quue into a strike with a 3 person fireteam and then farm lost sectors for 4 hours
"yeah, did you see ehroar's videos on it?"
That sounds...fun?
it's actually really strong
I read reddit comments summarising it
also **Hush!!**
SO GOOD
i want it
Oh man it's such a long grind for hush though
I'm already exhuasted
"Best way to get wendigo is get a three man fireteam, get corrupted, and run blind wells."
ohhhhh interesting
Now that's agood tip
So is anyone here close to getting the hush yet? I'm betting @Matos would be the first
Negative. Bows suck.
My one bow with dragonfly/explosive head is ... passable
Crazy idea.
Get rid of bows and buff scout rifles.
I vote for that idea
Is there still a raid happening tonight I can join?
We have some people online but it feels like it's a bit too late
I'm happy to join if we've got the people
I'm actually fucking pissed
Plane got delayed 3 times
Finally board only to have the pilot max out his hours
Dang dude that sucks
Sorry to hear that.
So basically I'm stuck in JFK with the option of waiting for a pilot which is unlikely or I find a hotel room and rebook a flight that might have room which is just as unlikely
flying is like the worst experience
This is by far the worst flight experience I've ever had.
"Not at all the fault of the people involved, still fucking pissed."
"Still stuck here lmao. Slept overnight in the terminal so we could get onto a 7:15am replacement flight. Well, 7:15 has come and gone, no plane has shown up."
14+ hours now.
"16 hours, both flights cancelled. I just want to get back to fucking Toronto. Hell, just find me a fucking way over the stupid fucking border I don't care. I'm pissed off now."
I’m in Toronto!
Are you stopping over?!
Let’s hang out!
I’ll feed you.
In exchange for pvp lessons.
I'm not in Toronto
I'm in JFK
Been stuck here for 16 hours
If I was in Toronto I'd be so much happier right now lmao
Ah shit. I was just waking up and saw Toronto pop up on my phone.
Hahaha all good
The Xbox game pass pc beta has started up for $1 a month til it actually launches. Master chief collection is a part of the beta.
"Oathbreaker, I sincerely hope things get better for you today."
yeah good luck man hope things start to go your way soon
"Oh my god, that sounds like a nightmare!! Hope it gets worked out soon Oath."
"Yeah, it's been ridiculous. I just want to go home"
What airline are you flying with?
Delta. We grabbed a flight with air Canada now
"Ok, good to hear. Keep us updated!"
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/byk7gz/not_sure_if_this_has_been_mentioned_before_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
Everybodies been talking shit about my sword. 😂😂
"Swords OP, please nerf"
ooooof
Glad your nightmare is almost over Oath
Hey @Arixama
You know what’s great about swords?
"Everything. They look dope as fuck, let you be a shield titan without having to pop a super, give you a third person view without having to emote in pvp, and can three shot a good chunk of bosses."
...I’m sorry the answer we were looking for is nothing! 😜
2 and a bit hours before I get my flight home
Can't come soon enough
Also swords are bad with the exception of Black Talon
Black Talon is pocket Dawnblade
That being said to get the pocket Dawnblade you need to use a sword instead of an LMG and you give up an exotic slot
"I see yall talking, but you're not using swords ever, so your claims are baseless. 🤷‍♂️"
Oh cool Halo MCC is already showing up on the Game Pass PC app
😮 exciting!
Also $1 is exceptionally cheap
"Also, wondering if anyone is interested in doing last wish today"
"Cool, let's see if we can get a group together"
"Ari, I used black Talon a while ago for a shits and giggles PvP heavy"
Was some of the most fun shit I've used in a while
Go watch Bakengangsta if you want to see it taken to really god-tier levels of play
im down for LW
I'm going to bed real fucking early. Looking at maybe an hour or two of sleep in the past 40ish hours
"damn, that's crazy"
It's what happens when you gotta sleep on the floor of an airport terminal lol
Good news is I'll sleep like a fucking rock
queuing for gambit prime if anyone eants in
ill be able to in a bit
Sure give me a few minutes
yeah im getting smashed in crucible
ok im in chat
Welp my laptop crashed
"I’m in for LW; also could I get a team to run shattered throne for power gear, as well as possibly COS? This could possibly be my last chance to complete within 1st week due to time restraints"
Oh sure I need to run throne as well
"So, turns out it's not difficult to one-phase Gahlran"
As long as people are on top of things
I definitely would be down for cos
Finally cracked 60000 triumph score!!!
On Canadian soil once more
🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦
Still got like an hour to go before I'm home though lol
But
I am not stuck in an airport terminal again
:BAblobby:
^ that times about 1000 is me internally right now
"Oath, are you Canadian?"
Me externally is about 1/1000th
how has this not come up before
where are you based?
Hamilton
Hamiltoe?
I'm in Downtown Toronto
like right in the core
Yeah I'm over on the tip of Lake Ontario
Didn't realize that you were Canadian either lmao
i swear theres another canadian too
Littlepants and I are canadian as well
Pants is in toronto
"I tried to figure out how to set up the fancy bot, but I got nothing so I'll do it the old fashioned way: Who all is willing to do Crown of Sorrow tonight in about 1 1/2 hours from now?"
!lfg
"type ""!lfg create"""
TRISSIN!
you're canadian
ya'll holding out on me
"pants, where in toronto are you?"
Trissin where are you at?
Christ I thought I was like the only Canadian
pants is in vaughn he says
i'm in vancouver rn
Ah okay okay
Ah that also makes sense
ah the west coast
"oh shit, vaugh is close by"
Thanks Ari
get to it on the subway extension now
This is just fueling my conspiracy theory that all Canadians know each other through some sort of hivemind
we all have our box from the Prime Minister to communicate through each other
its a small box. fits in the palm of your hand.
called a tell a fone
**takes notes**
@Arixama >_________________________>
:BAsalt:
im just watching the microsoft e3 conference and i dont want to wait for holiday next year for infinite.
"It looks good, but after Halo5 I think I want to see some gameplay"
But yeah the trailers so far have been quite good
I want Infinite so much
I also want a bed right now and a nice cold drink
what was wrong with halo 5?
Campaign
Liked Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077 seems pretty rad as well
Hyped up to be one thing and it was something else entirely with a shitty plot in my eyes
Multiplayer though was pretty solid
"I only saw Let's Plays, but the story was dumb as heck and kinda spoiled the goodwill from Halo 4's incredible ending"
i literally played through all of the halo games leading up to it and loved it.
Also the Prometheans are stupid to fight.
"but i also love trash things, so"
"I mean in some respects it's an okay story, but the thing is they did those amazing Hunt the Truth campaigns, set it up to have the Master Chief go totally rogue, where he really just decided to take on a mission to track down Cortana during a period of time where it wasn't uncommon for the MC to be picking and choosing missions for himself and Blue Team to embark on"
"Granted, they aren't Grey Team so they don't have full autonomy from the UNSC FLEETCOM but come on, the Infinity gets pissy when Chief says ""Hey I'm gonna go do a thing, last mission got done and everything is good"""
I dunno that's just my tired as shit opinion on H5
It had an okay premise but just got executed poorly
I mean despite everything once it comes to PC I'll play the heck out of it anyway
It's going to be so weird playing an fps with no superjump or mantle.
huh the nessus chests have refreshed and are set to refresh again tomorrow
I think they made imperials easier to farm
!lfg search
"@Trissin would you be down to do crown of sorrow, or nah?"
"Absolutely, but I'm not sure I'll be ready in 40 minutes"
"Also, we're still missing one"
id be down for starting later.
"I asked for help making the group to try and start soon, but only because I feel like this is my last night to try for week 1. I just didn’t want to set a time too late. I’m willing to start whenever so long as we’re willing to try our hardest to finish"
Wait what why is ||Keanu Reeves|| in Cyberpunk 2077?
This is what I get for watching the trailer on a tiny mobile screen
"because they wanted him to be, and he said yes"
Hmm that sounds too good to be true
Sneaky Canadians
I'll be chillin in chat for raid
he was on stage and everything
Found a 6th yet?
doesnt look like it
could we possibly lfg for one?
Can @Matos join?
i know hes at a pretty low light
Ohh yeah I forgot
Low isn't a huge deal I think
Matos can handle it
Yeah challenge builds character
I'm also 700 but dead tired so
I'm gonna bow out of that one
plus youd have to do the start quest
That too
Sorry I'll be logging on soon
Is Matos our 6th?
havent heard anything
@Matos you up for a crown of sorrow raid?
alright im good to go
join us! @Matos
"hey, just finished my Rainbow six session"
"Going to pass, still have really low light level and haven't even finished the chalice questchain"
i'm taking this season much slower to prevent burnout
"that's chill, we got a sixth."
"if you need help with anything in the future, let us know!"
For sure. When I have a better LL I’ll be up for it.
So can we try the raid again tonight?
I would desperately love to
"@here sorry for the large @, but I wanted to get another team together for Crown of Sorrow for the final night before the week is up"
I found a fireteam and just finished COS!
Woah congrats!
Well deserved!
"Made damage phase nearly every time; great group, all around 730"
I'm happy for ya!
Grats thawx!
SO anyone down for running the 100 power deficit nightfalls for the ||Truth|| quest?
I'll be free tomorrow!
How's the quest - is it long and grindy?
Nah pretty short due to a bug
I'm on the last step now and it took barely an hour
haha nice!
you do need a fair few tinctures though
Ari did you finish already?
"oh no, not sure how many of those I have left"
you can buy those right? from the ahamkara skull
Eh they're cheap
yup. for 50 baryons
Yeah from the right skull
"oh that's fine, got a crap ton of baryons sitting in my vault lol"
"i did finish it, you can just do the normal strike and a bunch of people are running it right now"
Ah ok that's perfect
and how does it perform ari?
Huh Hawthorne gave me a service revolver with moving target/kill clip
*Chronicler* Achieved
"It's the best title, no bias whatsoever"
im one taken egg from cursebreaker
which one?
From one of the ascendant planes?
no its between morgeth and the vault in lw
but ive not done the raid yet
Oh yeah that one
We should do last wish soon
agreed
Plus I still haven't finished crown
You've never done last wish @Buttkikker ?? We'll do it soon
Come see what all the hype is about
yeah ive only done the rivin fight
Maybe even do Riven legit
maybe snag yourself a 1KV 😉
at this point im mostly working on powerful gear but after i hit 750 ill likely go for titles and farm raids
"i mean you've already got dredgen, that's a good one lots of people use"
"I don't have it, just cant push myself to get the ghost shell"
its probably the one ill use
i got the ghost shell by doing daily bounties on all of my characters for like 2 weeks
dedicated like an hour a day towards the end af the forsaken season
I might go for it this season. I turned in like a **CRAP** ton of infamy bounties on all of my characters
"until i get protect the runner, theres no point in going for the resets"
what if you get it _while_ grinding for resets? 🤔
Alright I admit
Gambit with a proper team
Can be entertaining
I don't think fun is the right word
But it's something
"I’m here, hello?"
Dozed off.
Someone say gambit?
just got my friend protect the runner
Dang nice
just one game and I hate that they are making players use snipers in crucible
Agrees
I think rumble is going to be the easiest way to farm out the sniper kills
"I just want to get the bounties done, but I die almost instantly after I revive because of sniper range"
For warlock use the contraverse holds for easy one hit kills
For titan I just used the disco helmet with shoulder charge
Also I'd recommend the izanagi for some one body hit kills
"Still don't have Izanagi; besides, I'm not interested in the crucible sniper rifle, I just want to play a game where everyone Isn't using a sniper for the quest"
"Collecting the ghost stories, and I have to say that I love the Ghost Community Theater Presents"
It's so cute!
So glad I was lazy and held off on the Vanguard's quest against the Drifter; the quest just gave me the new Warlock helm
"Apparently it's meant for crucible, because it also has Sniper reserves"
.......
Everyone seems to be getting it but me
"It's only been a week, don't give up!"
"Feelin good about this, need better boots though"
:o is that hush?
yup just got 21% last night so now i have all the gambit pinnacle weapons
Congrats man!
Holy cow you really are a dredgen
:)
He impressed me with his invades and I'm not easy to impress.
Oh congrats @Trissin and @Thawxtem for being among the first to complete the raid!
Haha thanks @RonInDune !
Our fearless leader!
Grateful for the compliment RonInDune!
Just finished a gambit match where I would've gotten protect the runner by the guy died at the last second :BAsalt:
Ah nice Gladd has finished a 3-man flawless for Crown already
i mean what else do they possibly have to do with their time right? lol.
Can we try for a clan attempt again this weekend?
Absolutely
I cant
No can do for me
Not saturday
Just learned that Xur has Queenbreaker
get on it fam PS4 clan is getting it tonight😜
I can raid tonight and sunday night
who would be interested in lw tonight
i'M DOWN FOR SURE
Oh no caps lock
"Happens when playing Destiny; I'd go for LW, just set up a time"
I need to finish up two games of reckoning before then for my bounty
it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks right now
just got mine done
What are the modifiers?
blackout arc singe and the melee one
the knight bosses are op with blackout
Yeah they kill you through well
A titan is verrry handy there with bubble
"Also Rumble is very ""fun"" right now"
Loaded into 3 matches with a combined total of 4 players not botting
Ok i don't have anything else to do tonight  so im down for lw whenever
Sounds like I should be playing Rumble for MT progress
Oh yeah I went from 6 to 12% in a jiffy
"Yeah Oath it's ridiculous in rumble right now, I went from 6% to 33% just by playing 10 rumble games, that too using just fighting lion"
"holy crap, only just learning now how crazy it is to have 6 wells in a single fireteam"
"litearlly infinite wells, and you can drop so many wells that your framerate drops to like 20"
Yeah there was a video where people took down public event bosses using nothing but well damage
It's pretty goofy
Finally checked out the menagerie. Not bad.
But I think I'm switching to my Hunter this week.
menagerie is very fun.
So apparently one can two person the Gahlran  deception phase by shooting colony grenades over the walls.
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlRB50c4xgg||
lol that's wild.
omg hahah
just like when you stand under Gahlran so he can't hit you with his Jotunn seekers lol.
this raid is full of surprises😂
grenade launchers seem really screwed up in cos
they're just really strong right now
like whatever that anarchy thing was
Isn't there a skip in the menageries using grenade launchers
i feel like they didn't intend for GLs to become this strong but i will not oppose it at all.
i think anarchy is just weird in general
it breaks a lot of things
Yeah they buffed fusions so alls right with the world
btw does anyone have wendigo yet?
"Not even close, sadly. 

If anyone wants to spend a few hours grinding for it, then we can load into a normal strike and then do lost sectors or blind wells over and over again"
im working on it currently if you want to join
"oh yeah, I need to farm for wendigo as well"
mind if I join @RonInDune @Buttkikker ?
I'll finish up this crucible and join in
sounds good
I'll be chilling in the voice channel
"@Trissin if yall are doing wendigo, you should try and get corrupted and then run blind wells"
"Oh yeah, we talked about it but we decided to do lost sectors instead because we think its faster"
Anybody free for a Nightfall?
Sure!
awesome!
can we make it a 100K run?
hey is anyone able to help me and nahkriin
were on levi and need to get him some seals but we cant do the castellem duo
we should only need to do it the once
possible twice if resetting the checkpoint works to get more of the seals
"Oh oops I didn't see the message, do you still need help with Levi?"
yes please
alright I'll join up
welp my game crashed
If you're doing this tomorrow I'll join in again
I think I'm done for the night
thanks for the help though
Yeah you really need 4 people to do it easily
"oh, i remember doing this a long time ago! @Buttkikker the way I two-manned castellum over and over again was with roaming supers, maybe that will help for u as well"
"I went around the room and bursted down the majors with melting point and full-auto shotguns, my friend defended with arcstrider/tether/other ad-control supers"
huckleberry is good for this
Gratz on 750 @RonInDune
I'll have it Tuesday if I don't have it before. 🎉
Yeah the targeted upgrades from Black armoy and the menagerie is so useful
"My titan is 749, just needs a arm piece"
agreed i should have saved managerie
I'm 3 armor pieces short and that's it
missing a bond for 750
Well you''ll get it on Tuesday for sure then
"My first 50 defeat game, holy shit"
Jesus christ oath
That is amazing
"Le Monarque! 2 down, 1 to go!"
It's such a cool bow
What's a good titan loadout for reckoning tier 3? For the dark knight section
Does bubble with helm of saint 15 work well?
Well of Radiance.
and Tethers. or two Arcstriders since it's arc singe this week - they'll destroy the knights especially if they're in the Well.
"Top tree hammer titan I think. Give you melting point, so you can give an extra damage buff."
you only need one tho. too many titans is unnecessary💀😂 hate to say it.
"He was specifically asking for a titan loadout though, cause I assume he's working on his powerful gear for that character"
oof.
i love my titan. but he'll be my neglected character this time😭
Thanks Ari that's what I'll go with then
"Ron, when in doubt about Titans...melting point."
There is very little content if there is any where something else will be better than melting point.
mid path arc could work this week
the super is fast and hurts both
"Funny thing about melting point, I can one shot spectral blades in the crucible if I have my peregrine greaves boots on"
but i dont play much titan so not experienced
Those boots will one shot any super except for blocking middle tree arcstrider but ONLY IF THEY ARE FACING YOU
"Basically it's a pocket ""Fuck you"" for any and all supers"
Wait really? Even shield titans?
I believe so
Dang I should use it more then
I gotta knock out a bunch of milestones tonight is anyone is around and has some to do on an alt and wants company.
Yeah sure I have to work on my hunter anyway
I should've had my buddy do a gambit match with you @Matos he's an invader out of necessity as well.
I'm always down for Gambit.
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arixama1187
Friend me up
"Guys if you want the Raid jacket for completing it in the first week, today's the last chance"
Oh right we will be in steam eventually.
"Yup, in just a couple months."
I'll add you when I get in my PC.
"So apparently ||data miners found a model for Touch of Malice within D2.|| I didn't know you could actually ||data mine gun models, just perks/lore/etc.||"
just hit 750
got a bond from leveling up my glory
Are you fabled already?
im like brave 2 or somthing
"Ah I'm the same, close to hitting my ceiling"
What's the meta like now? I don't see that many spectrals anymore
im using fighting lion for mountaintop and just getting lucky with wins
In comp?!? Damn dude
as long as i keep getting all the power ammo i can never lose
lel
I'm still slowly farming bots in rumble
ah
its fairly easy in low glory ranks
Are you trying for the sniper?
if i get it on the way then thats nice
but i do have all the sniper kills/headshots
Oh woah
did that in regular
So you almost have all the pinnacles for this season already
Finally getting back on tonight
Also I'm 750 on 2 chars now!
wow nice
After next week's milestones I should be good for crown of sorrow.
Nearly had another 50 bomb tonight
Lord of Bullshit is dumb as hell
dam
I play PvP way too much
Do you have the sniper?
"Nah, haven't played comp yet"
Been having a fun time in QP
Well since you haven't calibrated yet I wouldn't mind tagging along for a couple of games lol
Really would like recluse this season
It'll still pull my general MMR unfortunately
im going to try for mountaintop this season
Ohhh
If I can help people from the clan though I will
Wonder if I can get recluse just by the weekly bonus
Absolutely can
3 games a week with 1 win minimum
It'll take the whole season but
That's good enough!
I win about 1 in 3 anyway
I might just most of mountaintop done in rumble honestly
If anyone wants crucible tips though I'm happy to help
I'm getting 5% a match just by killing bots
im down to just the multikills like 81% done or somthing
Woah
comp gives 4x medal progress and 2.5x multikill progress
"Also it's Iron Banner next week, with bonus progress as well"
i cannot use grenade launchers in crucible for my life
"dunno why, they just really dont work for me"
i'll wait for mayhem
they arent great fighting lion takes 2 shots to kill
I'm slowly starting to grok fighting lion
Mostly do one burst with something then finish up with lion
Did lord of wolves get buffed?
Um.... Indirectly? You can activate the 10-shot for free now which gives bonus damage
You can map people
Uh so that's why crucible's a bit weird now
so many god damn grenade launchers all of a sudden in every playlist
yuuuuup
people want to grind out mountaintop now
"Ari, want to work on some milestones?"
hop in chat
you guys mind if i join?
We mind greatly
if you *dont*
Where's Ascendant Challenge this week?
chamber of starlight
aphileons rest
Thanks everyone
What do you get from the new Iron banner quest? Armor?
Yea at every step you get a powerful reward and it adds that piece to the token loot pool.
i think its to try and teach people how to iron banner
Oh god you're right.
Teach people how to iron banner?
What does that mean??
"like the first step is defeating opponents as a team, and the second is capturing points as a team"
"Oh okay, that doesn't sound too bad"
"Except for the current state of LoW, should be fine"
nightfall anyone?
"@me if interested, i'll be on pretty much all day"
i've already got card set up. two of us would make it easy
i would also appreciate a sherpa for shattered throne. i played forsaken back when it came out but never got around to doing the dungeon
i can join u when im done here
alright. just @me when you're ready
@Pentan if there's still room I'd like to do nightfall as well
cool beans. should we wait on you @Trissin? i see you're doing raid
if you guys want to start without me go ahead!
thanks hun
Still have to log in
@Thawxtem i'm in voice when you're ready
I just finished
mind if I hop in?
we're about to start
warden of nothing
could anyone help me open the leviathan underbelly please?
"at the entrance, the levers should be 153246"
from left to right
"yes, but they're resetting too fast for me"
Up your mobility. Also mida/mini ups your speed a lot
all my armor went to mobility (10); warlocks just aren't fast
it's possible youre pulling the wrong levers
sometimes it's buggy if youre standing beside it and not like right in front of it
like you can pull a lever from the other side if youre going fast
ive had that problem before
in my experince the hitboxes are odd stand right next to the lever. also you have more time than you expect
What the heck are these eververse changes???
So they're going fully into the transmog capabilities
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47935
"Ok this is actually a fantastic change, kudos"
"I'm a fan. Sad to see the Dragonfly set I maxed for that season go, though"
Oh yeah that's true
But you don't *have* to dismantle
Kinda do. Aren't they saying the gear itself will disappear because they will be ornaments instead?
"I don't think so, but I suspect they'll clarify that when they most more details about Armour 2.0"
Cause that's be weird
I think it would mess with the game if there was an armor piece out there that WAS the ornament. I suspect it would get glitchy if the armor is kept in game.
Yeah they might do something with that 'cause almost everyone has a leveled up eververse gear
"If I remember right, in Diablo 3 all transmog items were actual gear pieces. They might try to merge that system and the D2 armour system"
Anybody want to raid tonight?
what raid?
I'm in
"Doesn't matter to me, whatever people need to do. Maybe you can try crown matos"
yea i'm about 730 now
"Okay, let's do crown today"
"Wow, that was real fast lol"
oof I barely got in
"to anyone who's on and bored, I never managed to get into the leviathan underbelly."
i'll give you a hand
k 1 sec
i gotta log in
@RonInDune I just realized this new Eververse deal will definitely free up vault space
Yes!!!
That's the biggest bonus
There's a sort option in DIM for source:eververse
I kinda hope it extends to future Iron Banner gear
the new armor system and general will be great for the vault space
I'm going to spend hours deleting EVERYTHING
including shaders
oh no shaders
oh noooo
trasmat effects too
Go ahead and join up when ready
Can we wait around 10 mins?
"Sure, no worries"
"Oh wait is 7 ,cst 8 eat?"
Eat*
Eat**
"i believe so yeah, dont worry we sxtill have some time"
Omg autocorrect.
I hate my new phone.
Yea I need to finish this siege match.
nom nom nom
Almost ready to go @Arixama ?
Ya'll need a ringer i'll be about for a few hours 😃 good hunting!
Tarrabah is MINE
anybody want to help me with the truth strike
@Samakain do you mind joining a voice channel?
just any voice channel is fine
"Ooh, heroic menagerie next week will be pretty interesting"
"There's no matchmaking, so we have to enter as 6?"
Oh shit
Well this is why we need to be 750 at a minimum!
I should be 750 next week. I'm around 740 right now.
Also the guardiancon stream is way too sad to watch at work damn
I'm hoping I have good internet where ever I'm staying the 30th - 10th. I'd prefer not to do lumina on my phone
The true test of characters
"I should be able to hit 750 by next reset, but im too lazy to do challenges and stuff"
"actually, I think im 749 on my titan right now"
Remember you can get 3 powerful items in one menagerie run
Also can we raid again tonight?
"Sure, but I won't be home until around like 11 CT"
I won't be available then
I'm sure you guys can organize something without me
I actually won't be available at all tonight. Wasn't paying attention to time
Aw
Well we'll try again this weekend!
OH MAN
I'm reading the twab
And their investigating cross play
I have a small spark of hope!
https://m.imgur.com/a/RZxmJAX
that looks cool
Ooh those look pretty cool
Revealed them on the guardiancon stream.
748 and I still have mars flashpoint and nightfall to do
"yea, 750 should be soon"
i still have all my menagerie to do this week
Then you definitely have it!
What're you missing?
Mostly armor.
"Good thing IB armor is easier to get, and is all power gear"
I won’t be on for a few days I’m going on a trip
Ooh exciting. Vacation time?
But butt!? Who will invade for me?!
"I know it'll be hard, but you can just not play gambit for  a few days. 🤣"
>________>
"Trust me Matos, it's not the end of the world to not play gambit hahaha"
Okay I'm going to need everyone to calm down.
"Just saying, I can (not) do any more raids this week. What little time I won’t be at work will either be in Iron Banner or finally watching Neon Genesis Evangelion on Netflix"
http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47948
NOT TOO BROKEN
Yikers
"Last thing I heard was they didn't want to crunch teams to fix it, which is why they have it slated for later"
"but if they looked at disabling it and said ""Nah"""
*WTF*
You can really map people with it
"Last thing I heard was fine, I can understand avoiding crunch"
"Honestly I didn't have too bad a time with it, the sniper spam on every lane feels way worse"
"But looking at it and going ""Let them go nuts""

Uh..... what? You patched Prometheus Lens so quickly I didn't even have a chance to play it. This is gonna be weeks where the only ways to beat them is a) Join them b) Fusions but only if you have a good roll and are good with them c) Sniping them"
"I regularly get 14m+ kills with it, up to about 18m for consistency's sake, a shotgun that kills from that far is more than just a little dumb"
yeah that thing is broken as hell
not as bad as prometheus lens tho. crucible was just a bunch of laser tag until that was patched
What exactly happened with Prometheus? Was the damage too high?
just a tad.
basically the burn damage that it applied was re-applied on every tick of damage
so you could apply the burn damage an insane number of times and it quite literally melted anything
Ooooh
ttk was practically zero
I wish I hadn't missed that!
"the funny thing was, this bug was discovered and then xur sold the gun"
"so it's not like only a few people had it, it was readily available to everyone"
Dang that should be a mode of it's own
Bungie made xur sell it. So that everyone had access to it
yeah i think i remember them saying that they did that so at least it would be fair until they fixed it
anybody wanna go for menagerie triumphs later tonight?
"Sure, i'll play some menagerie but i'm not any good lol. I've only tried it once"
oh it's not that hard
"the mechanics are simple, mostly just dps checks that take effort"
"i see, just lmk when i guess"
cool beans
"like i said, later tonight"
gotta go for now
I won't be around until later tonight.
Ok I watched a video of the Prometheus lens meta and it looked absolutely hilarious
One of the best parts was the people running around with cold heart just to be different
Was coldheart broken as well?
Not at all.
Coldheart had a brief moment with Calus at launch. That's about it.
When does the void trace rifle come back again?
Wave splitter?
Is that the void one?
"The one that's ps4 exclusive, yeah?"
So
According to a new video
It is still possible to solo Kalli without using Whisper
??wat??
How??
There's a joining allies spot
"So thanks Bungo, gonna go try this and maybe solo Kalli like I planned until school got in the way"
Stream it!!
We'll see hahaha
"Gotta get the strat down, optimize gear, all that stuff. Real preliminary but that might be a tomorrow and Sunday thing."
Right. Gear is set I think. Real nervous about this but it's a lot easier IMO. Less factors other than just timing the spot to avoid the wipe mechanic
Timing window is definitely tight
"that took a little longer than expected, but i'm back now"
I'd still like to do menagerie triumphs if you're available @Trissin
oh crap I just went for food
"not sure what time zone most of the clan is in, but i'm in cst and i'll be on pretty late"
"i'm on, just give me a shout when youre good @Pentan"
@Trissin playing iron banner match real quick but i'm in voice
@Trissin i just got that emblem i was telling you about. the purple version of the one i had on last night
"oh damn, nice. Did you hit like a higher winstreak or something?"
Or was it just random drop
nah it's just a stupid rare drop from turning in tokens
lmao what
tokens
yeah it's silly but it looks great
"Oh, the Smoldering Flame emblem? Yeah, it's dumb. Low drop chance from tokens. The orange-red one is from completing ALL crucible mastery triumphs lmao."
yeah i saw that. pretty absurd
It's for the collectors and the hardcore pvp guys
Low drop change from shaxx?
Does it look good?
I mean... yeah?
I like it
Is it exclusive to this season?
"Nah, been around since like S4"
I'll get it next season then
Anybody for nightfall?
Not free atm but I'll be on a bit later @Samakain
"Awesome, i'll be around for a bit so let me know when you're free 😃"
will do 👍
"i'd like to do either great hunt or the new raid soon. i haven't even touched the new raid yet, but i've definitely got the light now"
great hunt? is that last wish
right yes it's called last wish my bad
the armor is called great hunt and i confused myself
"yeah, im down to do last wish and/or crown"
have you done scourge ?
scourge? don't even know what it is
"that was the raid for black armory, it's on earth"
oh damn
"like i said, i've been gone since forsaken"
WE can do one today if we have people!!
that would be swell
"but of those 3, last wish is the only one i'm familiar with the mechanics of"
and last time i did it there were still 2 wishes that we didn't even know what they were
all good lol. you'll pick it up quickly
Is anyone else interested in raiding today?
"(I have a riven checkpoint on my titan, would love to finish that up as well)"
"absolutely, we can do that quickly"
does riven cheese still work? i've actually never done it legit. couldn't find a group that would
"i've only done it legit a couple times myself, the cheese is still going strong"
https://www.cheese.com/media/img/cheese/seriouslystrongcheddar.jpg
"Yeah I tried legit once, it ended badly for all concerned"
I'm definately down for today post pancakes.
I believe I was part of the group with RonInDune’s titan. I would be open to raids tonight as well
"Yeah that was bit of a glitchy run, I remember butkikker going through the portal for final stand and just randomly dying"
https://gyazo.com/2f66131d4f76280662bca3233ccdf4e4
!!!!!
Oh wooow
...carry?
Yooo
jk
Congrats!!!
"thanks!! we got the vessel bug too, so we had to do the final encounter using only 3 vessels in total"
also couldn't risk the deception bug on the third encounter
glad it's finally done now
I though you weren't going to attempt because of the bug!
I couldn't resist haha
"so for raid tonight we have myself, @Trissin , @RonInDune , @Samakain and @Thawxtem"
worst case scenario we just lfg for one more but with that many of us ready to go i think we definitely should
"actually i am not sure i'll be able to make it, sorry!!!!"
"I will probably be back later, but I don't know when that's going to be"
I'm up late so if people are down I can wait it out
"Haha thanks ron! But you should try to replace me if u can, since I don't want to make you guys wait"
you have our love either way
"maybe like ari, matos, oath might be able to help out"
I'll let you guys know when I'm back
Cool no worries
We can threaten matos to join by saying we'll cancel gambit if he doesn't come
i don't know matos but i'm always down for some good old fashion blackmail
anyone know how to tell if I've done a raid already this week?
go to raid.report
or you can check in game to see if it still offers you powerful rewards
https://raid.report/pc/4611686018475931494
"^^
raid report is our friend"
super helpful
helpfil
_shhh_
hm. apparently i had a day one clear on eater of worlds
wish that was an actual raid and not just a strike with shiny lasers
Aw but it was super pretty at the end!
@Pentan at what time were you hoping to go to a raid?
honestly ready whenever
just as soon as we have everyone ready
@RonInDune @Samakain what do you say to 1:17 from now
10:00 cst
which raid are we hitting btw? anything i should have on hand?
i'd like to do either last wish or crown of sorrow
I am currently fighting off a chest infection and already in bed. Good luck though!
"Oh no, get well soon matos"
:ghost: dinklebot will heal you
"oh my god, get well Matos!!!"
Get well soon Matos!
@RonInDune @Samakain it is time
we ride
Alright I'll be online in 5
just going to grab a drink.
i'm still new here so i don't really know who else would be willing to help us but we do still need two more assuming trissin isn't coming
Those blue runes seem rather rare
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/49darQ2OR04/maxresdefault.jpg
@RonInDune you coming love?
ah yeah joinin
@PC so anyone down for a raid in a bit?
I just got off. Been a long night of scrimming some peeps so I'm real drained
It's all good!
"If the offer still stands, I'm down for a raid"
"sorry lad, we just disbanded"
"one of our guys had a connection issue and another had to get off for the night and get some sleep, sorry"
probably reconvene tomorrow @Peronix
I'll be getting home soon lol
"I am like on a roll, getting these knocked out"
What the heck
Someone get our boy a fire extinguisher.
Nice mate!
lol ty haha
you're actually silly
Perfected Chalice is now mine!
Oh woah nice!
"Do you have to pay for the perfected node, or just all the upgrades?"
just upgrades
"Cool, I'll have it when I get home"
Try for a raid group again tonight?
@Pentan
Oh lord what is this
Click the plus
"I’m actually out of the house eating dinner rn. Just put in our order, but I should make it back in time for that"
Time is also flexible
"I can't make it sadly, good luck!"
"Is there a time that would work better for you today, @Samakain ?"
"Not really mate, i'm out for the rest of the day in about an hour. Thanks though!"
"Ah, alright. Next time!"
Just got home. I need a few minutes but I’ll be good to go soon.
cool. We still need 2 more I think
Hmm can we do it at around 7:30 CT? Roughly 30 mins from now?
"Yeah, that's good with me"
Good stuff
"i'm in voice, ready whenever"
i'll be on within 10
Alright I am ready whenever
"@RonInDune @Arixama we're getting ready, still need 2 more though"
My LL is to low
"What is your highest light? We don't have to do a new raid, maybe we can do something from year 1"
528
That high enough for a year 1 raid?
we think you might be able to handle last wish
"Yeah, more than high enough. All the year one content is <380"
"^
You should be able to do last wish as well, but the final few encounters might be kinda challenging"
what level are you?
50
just get in here it'll probably be fine
so we've got 5 now
"I’ve got to eat dinner, but I could still Raid if you still need someone then"
This time I’m off tomorrow
Sorry Thawxterm!
We just finished
The class item drops after the third step of the ib quest! :BAblobby: :BAblobby: :BAblobby:
Alright that's a really good emote though
Still stuck on that step
It's rough
Mostly it's the grenade kills that suck
Mostly Pvp sucks lmao
"yeah the grenade kill step sucks, but let me send a screenshot of the NEXT step..."
i think they're meant to get harder and harder
i can't even imagine what the last one is
"Last one is just completing matches, with streaks giving the best progreas"
🧀
85 percent grenade kills :BAblobby:
I've spent a good 50 matches with the grenade step and I've just hit 30%
"However, I finally completed the PvP step for Thorn and all I have left is that strike/nightfall lite so that's good"
"Nice!! Let me know if you need a hand with that - I don't think I'll be on tonight, but maybe sometime tomorrow"
I'll definitely take you up on that offer!  Tried to solo it and couldn't even get past the wards :cryJudge:
Yeah I can join in for sure
"i'm actually pretty upset about the nova warp nerf. it's actually been butchered. i otherwise really like the abilities in that path but the super is practically worthless, especially in pvp. weakest pvp super in the game imo. it also doesn't help that the built in blink it's supposed to have STILL hasn't been fixed. it just straight up doesn't even activate. contraverse hold was my favorite pvp exotic and now i think i'm just gonna go back to the same old bottom path dawnblade with ophidian aspect."
"like yes it needed to be nerfed, but it's been obliterated"
maybe i'll revisit it once the new stats come out and i can make a discipline build for just using grenades with that path
yes thank you all for coming to my ted talk
"It's not the worst super in the game. That goes to Tether. I've seen one good tether placement and that even still got the user killed. Middle tree voidwalker's strength comes from its neutral game. It has a 6m 1hko move that resets upon super activation and the super ending. The super is still decent, use your normal blink to get within range then do a very short charge. Don't know what's going on with the Dark Blink but I'll look at it once I get home from work tonight."
@Peronix I just got to that step in thorn also if you care to have me on your team
Feel free to take my spot @Thawxtem
"with all of the games IB is making me play, this might just be the season where I reset valor 3x"
"may as well go for the 5x then, for redrix"
any idea if the Iron Banner gear quests carry over to the next IB this season?
they should
What step are you on thawx?
on IB?
just picked up Non-Stop (kill with all types of rifles & swords)
at 0%
Gross
What class you running on? warlock?
ya; just wondering if it would be worth the effort to start on another character as well or if everything would disappear
"@Oathbreaker true, but i was thinking about tether and at least it can cancel supers. new nova warp loses against any other super"
"Handheld Supernova plus even a slight charge detonation from warp should kill some supers if I'm thinking correctly, might need to do some testing on that theory"
"I've seen the super used pretty extensively recently, it's not meant to be a dueling super IMO. Something like Arcstrider is meant to be a dueling super, where it fights other supers. Bottom tree Striker for example is meant to be a team killer, not a dueling super. Doesn't have the damage, whereas top tree Striker has the ability to duel a little better just because of the jump slam. Go off the top rope for that guy and follow up with a light strike and that should be enough damage to kill any other super, again it's all hinging on whether my memory plus math skills are working right lol"
@Thawxtem  I'm down.  Probably be easier than any of IB's quest steps
@Pentan  a man of warlock class I see. Bottom tree dawnblade with ophidian was my entire year 1.
let's keep the back to back raids going. i'd like to go for crown of sorrow today
"afraid I won't be able to join tonight, sorry!"
but I think you can definitely get a team together
No raids tonight until I finish IB
lol finish as in finish the quest? you can keep going later in the season when IB comes back
alright let's see if i can figure this out
@Roymau501
"Trissin and I are doing a thing, come watch if you guys want

https://www.twitch.tv/oathbreakerttv"
heck yeah!
those are some cool beans you got there
Amazingly done guys
@RonInDune @Roymau501  you guys coming?
it's raid o-clock lads
Good luck you guys!!
thanks darling <3
I'll be late sorry I'm still at work...
"If you can, LFG"
"give me 5, just moving some stuff"
how much longer do you think you'll be? if it's only like 30 minutes it'll probably take us that long to get organized anyway
otherwise we'll just lfg
I'll try but can't promise 30
Oh that's not as bad as I thought
That's horrifying
@RonInDune we decided to run menagerie once first so that's what we just finished. you any closer to being able to play?
@Arixama where did you find that?
I'll be ready in 15
aight cool beans we'll have a slot for you
Ishtar app. Is also in the d2 app
@RonInDune we're in raid room 95 in the d2 lfg discord
Alright joining
Sword kills done
https://clips.twitch.tv/IntelligentTardyToothNomNom
"Props again Oath, we did great today. You really nailed it getting the solo void down, we'll have the two-man argos finished soon!"
"I give you all the credit lol, I feel like solo void was ez pz, staying alive might have been harder"
"haha i don't know, it's hard to say - we make a good team though, glad to have you as my partner for this"
Definitely glad to be running with you
"Think this will definitely become easier, might become a regular thing"
Should I post that clip in general chat?
Lol that's up to you
How was crown?
couldnt finish last encounter; but we made it there.
"Oh, nice!"
"I think I'll be mostly free tomorrow, if anyone wants to run through it"
Hmm the heroic menagerie has some really easy modifiers it feels like:
"Iron is annoying I think, definitely not too bad though"
Anyone want to try it out today?
I'm down!
Blackout with the thralls and the Knights won't be easy
Oh wait sorry I cant
"That's okay, didn't mean right now - later tonight perhaps"
Message me when you guys are going.
😮 heroic menagerie looks pretty intense
The boss drops the new sword
and izanagi's catalyst
i'm watching ehroar haha
The catalyst?
whoops sry
I have Teawrex on the background lol
Ooh what does it do?
I think it's a buff to honed edge x4
but i might be wrong
"Hmm, it's good but I would have loved to have kept more than one buff for massive damage"
Tomorrow: _New video from Gladd!_ **Solo Heroic Menagerie blindfolded on rock band drums**
no doubt no doubt
Few weeks later: *Watch Oath and Trissin Two Man Heroic Menagerie!!*
ohhh i dont know about that one haha
"Equipment is still 750, right?"
Equipment?
"Like, loot?"
750 at the start but the boss is 770 I think
"It scales up, yeah"
They get pretty tanky near the end
"Like it's not dropping higher than 750 stuff even though it goes up to 770,right?"
Yeah I don't think we can earn anything over 750
It's not like the y1 prestige raid lairs
Think we'll get a buff for solstice?
Maybe
"Gladd was having trouble with a 3 man with Chevy and Clyde, don't know if two man is gonna be easily doable for many people lol"
At least currently
inb4 anarchy breaks some more stuff lol
"I still don't have a single year 2 raid exotic, bungo is super unfair"
wait what?
don't have 1KV/Anarchy/Tarrabah
oh but those are from the raids ron
They're supposed to be rare
!lw
like no offense of course but I wouldnt say not having it within 5 completions is unlucky
I know but I want 'em still gosh darn it
OH SHIT
You can pull hive repurposing from menagerie
I mean I got mine in 4.....
"Yeah, but you have shitty rng. Bungie was throwin you a bone"
yeah i'd love to do heroic menagerie tonight
Destiny servers gunna be down pretty much all day tomorrow
Why?
Why? Maintenance?
Fuck I meant Thursday. Prep for cross save.
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1143609715982602240?s=09
Oh dang a 12 hour maintenance window
Wtf am I gonna play
Steam summer sale is on! Go play the greatest FPS game of all time: Aliens: Colonial Marines
i sincerely hope thats a joke
"of course he's joking, everybody knows the greatest fps out there is roblox counterstrike"
1v1 me on de_dust2 you noobs
you asked for it
I don't think you want to give me an AWP though
Just saying
Tactical Shield only
fuck that
"oh crap, there's a triumph for completing it with 3 or fewer"
Don't quite know when I'll be online again
Having internet issues right now
Pretty sure our ISP provider router/modem combo thing is fucked once more
who are you with?
Rogers
ew
Aka I shouldn't be surprised we're having issues but
They have an exclusivity contract with the area
"Oh no, hope it gets fixed soon"
ISP monoplies are the *worst*
"Yeah these guys are godawful. Useless when it comes to helping fix issues like this. I'll give this router credit, lasted longer than every other one before it."
"That being said, it's been maybe just over a year."
hey we still doing heroic menagerie tonight?
but we're gonna need people
we could also do raid if people want
or something else
i dont mind
i'm just gonna list it as other for now until we know what we're doing
or menagerie i'll list it as menagerie
"Okay so just because I don't want to no give credit where it is due, the issue is actually for most of Rogers customers in Southwestern Ontario"
alright i'm gonna be playing overwatch with a friend so just @me when/if we're gonna do anything
Do you guys know a better Chalice runes gun chart than this one?
personally i'm a fan of braytech.org
https://braytech.org/chalice-tool
That one's great thanks!
OH MY GOD NO WAY
I THINK I JUST GOT MY LAST SLEEPER NODE
?????
AFTER LIKE 10 MONTHS
Goddang
Congratulations!!!!!
YAAAAASSSSSS
i've been hunting this emblem since warmind release
"well, not like VIGROUSLY, but like going for it in the background"
Ooooof finally
whenever i'm bored and have time
I figured out the secret to the emblem
"When i'm farming the lost sector, I usually get bored doing it like 50 times with the same loadout"
"so I switch it up, and today I was feeling nostalgic so I pulled out some old year 1 weapons"
including the polaris lance
and it seems rasputin liked that
lol bribing an AI never goes well
or maybe i've just been farming it for so long i've gone mad
roko's basilisk will getcha
wait i don't understand i thought all there was to the sleeper nodes was crafting them out of the 4 thingies and then finding rasputin's corresponding music box
"yeah, that's correct"
There are 40 unique sleeper nodes
And getting them all *is a pain*
oh the emblem thing is a different discussion
that's what had me confused
"you have to get all the sleeper nodes for sleeper stim masterwork, right?"
nooo not at all!
holy crap that would be inhumane
lol i've been background grinding it for sleeper masterwork because i thought that's what it was lol
so how do you get sleeper masterwork then?
nooo tangerine you poor child
yeah i know...
so it doesn't really make any sense
but it comes from prestige spire of stars
lol aight
"random drop chance on any encounter, kind of like the acrius masterwork from prestige leviathan"
"so when prestige EOW and SOS came out, they had to offer some sort of 'good' reward to chase outside of just 400 power level gear"
"so for prestige EOW it was the telesto catalyst, and for prestige SOS it's the sleeper catalyst"
"and tbh, the sleeper catalyst is really good"
what it do
"it speeds up the charge time and improves ammo, I think"
hold on lemme check
"yeah, speeds up charge time and more reserve ammo"
oh hell yeah
i'll have to invest soon
Had an amazing rumble game by the way
"we should do spire, it's a really fun raid"
😮 10.5 efficiency??
Spire is so cool
Lol it was just me and another guy
We had a gentleman's agreement and never killed one another
Just grenade launchers
Died to my own launcher killing me
damn ron
ron i'm so jealous
That's what rumble is like for me
i guess i'll have to do spire for my next raid
spire is so much fun
that's what i keep hearing lol
i'm gonna watch some black mirror and then call it a night tho
hahaha sounds chill
maybe let's do a spire tomorrow
black mirror is anything but chill idk why i watch it
black mirror is good
i like it
yeah sure spire tomorrow works for me
"well yes i like it but ""chill"" just isn't the word i would use to describe it 😂"
"spire isn't too long either, maybe if we finish quickly we can do crown or smth afterwards"
"haha fair, maybe not 'chill'"
we did make it to what i believe is final encounter on spire the other night
got pretty late so we called it a night
"speaking of, i need to just stop typing or i'm gonna be here all night"
gn gentlemen
night tangerine
"Alright so I found something interesting, there's a random yellow bar vandal in the EDZ who has a massive health pool"
Just a vandal and a shank hiding near the water
In the Sunken Isles
Anyone know what that's about?
😮 i haven't heard of that before!
i know there was the one on nessus by the waterfall
"He's not a boss, just a major"
That's Randal.
Randal the Vandal.
He was in D1.
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c5ec98/as_heroic_menagerie_allows_you_to_enter_solo_you/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
"Only lore node you can't get without starting menagerie is the gauntlet one, but it's the encounter after lamplighting"
"Congrats on the completion Trissin, that emblem is rare as hell"
aha thanks oath!
"So, it looks like I really need to get going on upgrading my chalice. Seems you need the chalice fully completed to get the Izanagi's catalyst"
Anyone know of good ways to get imperials?
get the triumphs!
easy 500 imperials for each
Plus some 2250 imperials from the chest on the barge on Nessus
"Otherwise, there's always AFK farming in rumble"
"Right, the problem is I have no glimmer lol"
You get a drop every 4~6 games
Spider!
Recently when I checked he sold glimmer for dusklight shards and etheric spirals
yesterday was the titan planetary mats
So I bought 80000 glimmer worth
i have like 3 alkane dust lol
"Hmm, then your best bet is to wait till glimmer for shards"
"I think so, yeah"
(or afk in rumble)
"(for max chaotic evil points, afk in competitive)"
Don't be that fucker.
Haha I don't plan to be AFK in any pvp
"Rumble, fine. Competitive, I will have zero respect for that decision."
"I was kidding, but yeah it's infuriating"
"Can't even vote to kick, which is a feature I really want"
"Also, I had a 1v4 comp game last week, wonder if those were AFK-ers getting kicked at the start of the game"
maybe ill like farm some strikes or something
get some wendigo progress and have that chance for imperials
You could just slot a single rune in your chalice and do the chest glitch
"do they award from playlist strikes, cause los is now a nightfall"
oh is lake a nightfall this week
they just changed it
militia's birthright would allow me to equip 3 grenade launchers at once
"Every time you use a rune and open the chest it has a chance to award imperials, and if you have one of the upgrades it refunds a single rune from your chalice"
aw i don't have the rune refund upgrade just yet
also i dont think i have a lot of runes
Whaaaaat
Anyone down for grinding LoS nightfall tonight?
Really would love the birthright
yeah ill run it with ya
you wanna farm for militias? thatll get you runes
that works out really nicely
Does nightfall give you runes?
I though it was only playlist activities?
"""runes in strikes, crucible and gambit"" -runefinder"
Oh nice
doesnt say playlist on either runefinder or wealth
yeah it doesn't have to be playlist
*nice*
playlist strikes is just for wendigo so you cant cheese it as hard
Back from out of state
Welcome back!
^^ Welcome back!
How were your travels
mostly just really long drive there and back and unpacking old stuff from the house were going to sell
"Oh wow, I see
well glad to have you back on"
"Actually @RonInDune , when do you want to farm lake of shadows?"
Evening-ish?
Maybe around 8?
"Okay, sounds good"
Also @Matos hope you're feeling better now mate!
"I am, I appreciate it guys! Just a nagging cough that should be gone in a day or two."
Feel free to join up on Ari and I whenever @RonInDune
I'll be another 25-ish minutes
ALright I'm logging in now
i need a sherpa some time this week now that shattered throne is back
"oh yeah, shattered throne"
im down to do that sometime
"also, does anyone want to raid tonight"
"okay, maybe we'll do something today"
spire or crown or something
maybe heroic menagerie
so thats 6
hot damn!
"first, i'm gonna help ron get his militia's birthright"
Yay thanks!
gl
Did you get it already?
"I was farming with ari earlier, I actually got 2 already haha"
so it's not nearly as bad as before
the more you do the higher the chance now right?
"oh, there's a drop protection on it now??"
on all nf loot i think
dont remember when it got implemented but i remember it did
it was like mid forsaken or so
itwas before ba
Just started storming pretty garsh darn hard where I’m at. Internet went out and idk when it’s coming back so I might not be able to raid for a bit.
Picked up a piece of hail the size of my thumb
"wow, that's crazy"
"never mind, storm passed"
i have been ressurected
This was on me
jeez
damn thats crazy
When do people want to start?
whenever
me and nahkriin are in comp rn but otherwise were good
"you should join us @Pentan , if you get disconnected we have no problem just chilling until u get back"
got the triumph for mountaintop just need fabled!
holy cow
nah the storm passed so i'm good
i'm in raid chat
I'll need 5 minutes
Is there room for another in whatever raid is going on?
i think we have 6
"in other words, you're unwanted"
:nkoCry:
"if you'd like, you can have my spot thawx"
i don't mind backing out
everybody in here is nice but trissin on a dangerously high level of positivity
i might actually have to back out cause i have to be at work at 7
and it s getting decently late for me
😦 next time ari!
"i'll be ready to go soon, give me like 10 minutes or so"
Are we doing Spire first?
whatever people want
i was thinking spire and then crown
I think some people here haven't done spire yet so yeah that sounds like a plan
"Ok i'm ready, we're in the voice channel @RonInDune"
good luck guys!
thanks ari!
"@Trissin power went out, give me a few"
we're chilling
My screen cut black right as I sprinted up the the chest it was perfect I wish I could shadowplay 😂
"Router is rebooting, takes like 5 minutes"
https://youtu.be/cvuTaeMLHs4?t=1156
@PC would anyone be interested in doing a 3x riven farm to try and get 1k some time tomorrow evening?
@Arixama were you not with us last night? a bunch of us ran last wish and spire of stars
I wasn't cause I had to be at work at 7.
right my bad
"Nah, you chill, I was originally gunna be in that group"
Servers are back!
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1144349905634283521
@Pentan  WAKE UP
TIME TO GO BOYOS
Still can't sign in. I think there might be a rush on.
i just started playing stardew valley for the first time too
good game
but not destiny
so i've heard
yeah especially with friends
you know what a better game is? @Buttkikker
fite me
ok yeah servers must be overburdened i'm gonna continue stardew valley for just a bit
1596 hours !!!1!!
Bloody hell
"yup, no afk"
i'm very proud of my terraria hours lol
it might also be the only steam game that i have every achievement in
wait is that ur hours?
So many punched trees
I don't think my entire steam inventory combined can go that high
yup that would be correct
ive got 1671
damn you
f
My top games are dota and dark souls and I haven't played either of those in years
got a buddy with almost 3k hours on csgo
My top is gtav with 359
See that's fairly understandable
I've got 900 some active in d2 tho
Can anybody actually log into Destiny?
"I'm around 700 in destiny which is probably the highest ever, other than the games from before steam etc."
"Link me that, Ron"
I don't think anyone can sign in
@Arixama https://www.wastedondestiny.com/4_4611686018475931494
😮 i'm at 797
Only at 538
But that's on PC alone
738 for me
621
"and then my top steam is gtav at 527, but a **lot** of that is loading screens/afk/other garbage"
lol top steam for me is Civ5 at 768. Man that's a lot of spearmen.
so many spearmen
"makes me really appreciate destiny loading screens, you can still play with your inventory, look at pursuits and map, do other stuff"
yes destiny definitely does loading screens the best
Yeah that's a killer feature of D2
oh man look at those old d1 emblems
What were those emblems for? do you remember?
i know the osiris one was for going flawless
"Yep, Trials Flawless emblem"
the 3rd one was something to do with prison of elders
House of Judgement emblem
i think it was ranking up Variks?
Looks something like that
Other one was a House of Wolves emblem relating to Skolas
I miss D1
Had some real good shit
yeah i know a lot of people say this but it would be so nice if they just release a dlc that had all the old raids
"I never played it, but I keep thinking i should. No idea how well that'd actually turn out."
i'll join you sam
lets go play d1
It's a step backwards in some aspects but a step forward
You guys on PS or XB for that?
im on ps
"Ah, damn"
"wait, that would mean i gotta go buy ps+ again"
PS+ is a killer.
Fuck I miss my Lord High Fixer..... Luna's looks similar but like.... LHF was SO GOOD. Sureshot/Outlaw/Rifled Barrel/Luck in the Chamber
I miss this guy
Hung Jury too
fatebringer
chaos dogma
Longbow Synthesis
Matador
Saladin's Vigil
can we have all these weapons back pls bungo
Treads Upon Stars
"^^
that was good"
First Curse
No Land Beyond
i do not miss nlb
"Skilled hands, good weapon"
"in my hands, unusable weapon"
i was real bad with it
856
Are you ready for the real kicker though?
453 of that was on my warlock I deleted.
oooooooooooof
Because he looked dumb
my titan looks dumb
its why the helmet is never off
"I couldn't do it. Plus with my original warlock not being awoken and not getting the special little dialouge in DC, it hurt me"
still can't log in :(
What do we think odda are they'll bring back khvostov for new light?
it'll probably just be traveller's chosen
we could use another exotic sidearm
"idk what khvostov is but traveller's chosen is the sidearm from the intro, right?"
shh! do NOT ask for more sidearms
khvostov was the Destiny 1 starting gun
more than anything theyre boring
"I think it'd be cool if they used khvostov, and then gave you the quest for the exotic once you got to tower"
the new emote looks pretty cool
also it seems the menagerie chest bug is getting patched july 9
farm your legendary shards now boys
Oh man that emote is the greatest
I'm getting it for sure
still can't log in
trissin that pic earlier was the scout from vog right? i also miss it :(
One of my most asked for features in destiny is a Mirror of transformation like option to change our appearence
My hunter looks like she did her makeup in the dark
"Yep, slot a single rune in and just do the chest glitch"
get yourselves a shitton of shards
She looks like she wanted to go full goth but lost interest halfway through her face
does anyone here really need more legendary shards though
wait do you not have to keep reslotting runes every time you open it?
Yeah you do
"i mean i'm sitting at 700 shards rn, but it takes a bit of effort to keep that up. also if i have more i can spend them on enhancement cores and whatnot"
oh yeah you might wanna farm some shards then
I used some 10000 gunsmith tokens to go up to 2000 shards and I hover around that most of the time
that's a pretty solid amount
Yeah and masterwork cores are not as rare as they used to be I feel like
I always have 250 or so
i need more masterwork cores
Do the bounties!
Easy 9 cores every day
yes i started doing the bounties about a week ago they give a lot
also the wanted bounties from spider
that is a lot
I'm at 1700 shards
what do you guys spend shards on???
If you do the Gunsmith bounties right you get a stupid amount of cores per week
Well
I don't
lmao
?? what the heck
It's mostly just in case Xur starts selling more stuff in the engram
maybe its cuz i dont visit xur
Or to farm cores from Vance by having an overstock of Sim Seeds
"so the heroice menagerie bosses apparently drop unique swords that look like reskins of the class exclusive swords from year 1
there's also a ship and of course catalyst for izanagi's"
"I just logged on by the way, no issues."
those are some cool beans
"Just letting people know, seems like login is fixed"
ok so the swords all have new unique perks but the warlock sword has both perks from the hunter and titan swords for some reason?
although the titan sword has heavy gaurd
hunter sword it by far the worst imo
it's worth mentioning that i'm talking about curated rolls
"Let's see if we can do crown, heroic menagerie, shattered throne, etc. today if people are interested"
Whatever people need
I'd definately like to run shattered throne. Still need that damn ship
whoops
😂 i just cracked myself up
you should have left it there so people could laugh at it lol
let me see if i can do it right this time
is there not one for shattered throne?
no way
there isn't
oh well
wait is it 6 or is it 3
it's 3 😛
yeah i quit
"i mean, the both of you are online right now and ron and I are happy to help"
I was about to say if we are all good to go we can knock it out now haha
it's worth mentioning that i'm gonna eat dinner in about 45 minutes
how long is it?
"we can get it down in under 40 i think, right Trissin?"
I think you can do it in around 6 minutes easy
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfSqHd4jWaA
do you need anything from shattered ron?
Nah
but aren't there side bosses and whatnot?
Only if you're after wishender
"like i've never ran it before and only seen short clips, going in mostly blind"
i am definitely after wishender i don't have it yet
it's ez clap
aight whatever whoever wants to go just hop in voice ig
"Cool, well Doing throne for the first time is a good reason to do throne imo. haha."
I'm in orbit and good to go
Hope you don't get the ship on your first encounter
well you'll never guess what happened
"Yeah, about that"
You gunna have some salty sues in here
"Well the ship drop rate is now 20%, so it's pretty high chance of getting it in your first run"
First run is different than first ever encounter tho 🤣🤣
i also got the ship last encounter
!spider
is that glimmer for shards??
does anyone know if the nessus barge chests are per character or account
Per account
So are we raiding tonight?
Also asking that makes me feel like a Viking about to attack some English towns
lmaoooo i know what you mean
what raid are yall doin?
"I was thinking crown, we could do something else tho"
"i wont be around, was just curious what you were going for"
crown has my vote
I'm ok with crown or scourge
YA BOIS BACK WITH A VENGENCE BABY
oh dang
hell yessss brother
That looks like something from the Matrix
no more shitty grainy gameplay for me
ok so i need to complete a heroic public event for this quest but of course the quest doesn't bother to tell you that you can't solo it because you need to be in two places at once so i just waited 15 minutes for the event to spawn and now i have to wait again
"yeah thanks ghost, thanks for the level up, that really helps"
you can't solo it?
"like i said, you have to be in two places at once"
which public event?
i mean it's probably possible but really difficult
it's the spire defense in the hallows on nessus
you have to stand on a plate for like a minute to make it heroic and also guard the spire on the other side of a rather large wall
"oh, that one"
"damn, that sucks yeah"
someone mind hopping in voice so you can join me the next time the event pops up?
@Trissin could you just join me real quick or are you busy? event is about to start
i'd like to nominate trissin for best clan leader NA
did you get it?
"yes, thankfully"
it's really not hard except for the being in two places at once part
just needed somebody to stand on the other side of the room
i know its also timed
Seems we're missing 2
"it would appear that way, yes"
Sup. raid time?
"Just gonna do a quick easy crown, get the challenge done as well. Feel free to join us!"
Oops
where is the voice channel?
"Sorry, Morton, we're actually full haha"
well your loss
We're in the voice channel @Buttkikker @RonInDune
this is awful what is this
Basically it's just a run of Leviathan with a team that knows you want to kill the watchers; it can be done in a single go
well yes but what is the quest for?
key for box that has Izanagi's Burden
"if the material only comes from the watchers, then where does calus get materials for the watchers? from other watchers? where did those watchers come from? is it some element like vibranium and calus just has a monopoly on it and decided to put ALL of it in silly little alarm turrets?"
i bet it's the jelly
"Nah, Ana-1 is just lazy. We're killing watchers and stealing their no-longer-needed lenses. She doesn't want to build any lenses herself"
"You don't even actually need to run leviathan, you can just go into the raid, and go directly into the underbelly and farm engine room"
Engine room farm is stupid fast
"thunderlord is random loot pool, right?"
i don't have it and just pulled an exotic i already had out of xur's engram
might be post forsaken loot
xur still only has forsaken and earlier
"Same here, regarding the engram. second week that it's refused to give me the loot I don't have, and it's a non-quest helm from Warmind"
are you collecting the engram as  a titan?
"Hunter, which I need the helm for"
oh duno why i thought titan
what helm?
Thunderlord is festival of the lost which could be a weird loophole
that's true
it's funny how i walked away from festival of the lost with horror story and not thunderlord
i'm really smart
Also that you didn't grab it during arc week
i wasn't playing during arc week :(
i dropped the game during festival of the lost until a couple weeks ago
Thunderlord was stupidly time gated
thawx if its wormhusk crown its from zavala after beating the warming campaighn
cant spell
Started last week of fotl and was just go check out some lost sectors for 3 weeks
"Wormhusk is the only hunter helmet exotic from warmind, so that's what it is"
It didn't work like the aeons where if you got one you could get the others as a random drop on your other characters
oh whatt did you have to do for the first one?
been awhile
First aeon was for completing curse of osiris
that would explain it; it just never says in the description that it was tied to a quest
"Yeah, it's stupid. Its because I can drop from the world after you complete warmind"
so if you complete warmind can xur then drop it?
"Yup, and it can drop from engrams and shit"
"Xur can't drop opulence exotics, right?"
Nope. Only forsaken or earlier
"damn, i want peregrine greaves :(("
Good for trying to get random rolls though
I didn't know until recently that exotic engrams usually come from prime engram drops
"Play lots of menagerie/blind well, somehow that's where I've been getting most of my exotics"
"Yeah, I gotta play some menagerie"
High enemy count plus lots of orange bars
"Speaking of which, I'm clearing my DC, then heading to menagerie probably. anyone care to join?"
i wanna run menagerie to farm shards but i need more runes for austringer as well
"^
I'm gonna be farming austringer as well"
Make sure to get your 200 rune triumph done before the 9th!
right!!
y?
theyre fixing the multiple chests thing
!!!
"lol, i love the emotion conveyed by just !!!"
what's the 200 rune triumph?
exactly what is sounds like
so does putting worthless runes in slot 3 count toward progress or does it only count items made like black armory?
I'm pretty sure it's just slot
you get 3 runes of progress if you have all slots filled
"It's runes used, not items collected"
So fill up all three for max progress
Apparently the new sword from heroic menagerie can roll some pretty crazy stuff
Shattering Blade + Counterattack
i think its the titan one
"Yeah, that's the one"
Throne Splitter
I think it's void as well
good for COS 3rd encounter
"Guys I have a bunch of humble bundle keys being wasted for a while now, does anyone want any of these games?"
"I saw a video from aztecross recently, apparently throne splitter with tractor cannon, shattering blade, and counterattack buffs stacked together is like 5.6x one heavy swing damage"
testing on greg was like 45000 damage
which is actually just insane
Poor greg
insert flextape meme*
so uh... i think i just skipped a quest step?
i still have the black armory key mold. haven't even been to leviathan since i got it last night. a black armory key just dropped from a forge ignition though and it looks like the blueprint on the key mold quest
"Just for reference, a whisper headshot on greg is like 8.5k"
that's a lot of damage
who is greg and why do we hate him?
lost sector boss on titan used for a standard damage reference
yeah him
oh hey greg
anybody have any idea what's going on with the quest i mentioned?
@Pentan I haven't heard of it before
what key dropped
theres 3 keys they have very simmilar models
ok yeah
thats one of four
the quest is just for the last one
I dont even remember how this all works
There's so much stuff
the shield drones need to be destroyed at each forge on the second wave for a chest to spawn at the end giving you a key
or the quest if its from bergusia
and tangerine doesn't have the box yet?
guess not
its hidden near volunder
"apparently i do not have a yellow box, no"
oh youre gonna want to grab that
you can then insert the keys
once its filled you get the next step towards the exotic
"Also, @RonInDune , those are some pretty good games! You should try them out for yourself!"
I already have them all! got them again in bundles so they're sitting there being wasted...
ohhh didn't realize you already owned them lol
Yeah these bundles can get too much sometimes lol
anyone know where the ascendant challenge is this week?
thx
!daily
finally got mah title!
"ooh, congrats!!!!"
Congrats!!!!
"that makes two, what next?"
Welcome to the Lore Nerds Clubs
Dredgen/Wayfarer
Those are the only kinda easy ones remaining
I wouldn't say dredgen is easy
"I am going to try to finish u[p Dregen this season, just got the three resets left"
It's easier. Protect the runner is probably the roughest part of it.
"Wayfarer is something I'm stuck on until the right situations come; I'm missing Warmind nightfall gun, Ikelos shotgun & 1 of the guns from the nodes"
"Do I need to be the runner protected, or just someone on my team?"
Just on your team
"I know I need it too, so if we could get a team together to try for it tonight, I'd be down for that"
"I'm off today, so I'd love to!"
i'm in
"I'm not sure when I'll be available, but the earliest will be 530 but probably after 6"
I can be on in about 20 min
Do we have a collector?
I can try; we don't have only one attempt
I play collector but I won't be available at 6. If you don't get it tonight I can help tomorrow though.
@Trissin would you be available later?
"Not today, sorry"
"I might be on tonight, but it would be a lot later"
"If you guys are still on and looking, I'll definitely help out yeah"
i just got the exotic bow along with my first blast furnace
the black armory exotic bow that is
Lemon arc
"^
i like it a lot"
lol yes that's the one
"took me a minute to translate ""lemon arc"""
underrated exotic tbh
The lemon is magnificent
i mean i don't really use bows all that much
is it good in crucible or something?
_Several people are typing..._
It's pretty good in gambit and crucible honestly
sounds like Thorn II - The Bow
would bows be too slow to protect the runner?
"Yeah, sorta. If you like bows for PVP, then lemonade is good"
It's thorn before thorn was in d2 basically
"I like how satisfying it feels too, a very heavy *thunk*"
I'm just not fast enough with aiming for lemonade to be good for me in straight pvp
Plus it takes out invaders in two hits
I'm excited for whatever the heavy bow is gunna be
"It's got pretty good single target damage as a bow, but the exotic perk also offers ad clear"
"my first blast furnace has accurized, zen moment and rampage"
not that bad
Hunter + edz duds + 3 bows = Green Arrow
Not bad at all
We need goatee option during character customization to go full green arrow
the character customization is pretty derpy in destiny honestly
i just keep my helmet on
no use outside tower/farm
other than cutscenes
thank goodness too because most characters don't look that great
I'm so disappointed we won't see Zachary Levi as green arrow
"True, but I like the swirly awoken effects, makes me look like an Asari"
"Also, we need to have a private gambit match as a clan of 8 members for a triumph sometime"
"Oh yeah, I was wondering if people would be interested in something like that"
that's gonna be intense
clan gambit/pvp/whatever
I didn't know there was a triumph for it
"I love zen moment in auto rifles, turns them into a trace rifle like laser"
do you have horror story?
because it's pretty great for an auto rifle and it comes with zen
Nah I didn't like the Halloween event much so I didn't grind
Breakneck/misfit are my fave autos
"I miss valakadyn, from like year 1"
Scathelocke best auto 2k17
don't forget uriel's gift
I miss my y1 loadout.
"Scathelocke, mob Justice, perfect paradox"
ok i'm running 3 heavy ammo finder and i can use nothing but sword and GAIN ammo
that's crazy
"i've always felt heavy ammo finders are weird tho, they aren't always reliable"
like it's very inconsistent
yeah i think it's because even with the ammo finder it's still a low drop rate but once you have 2 or more i notice a HUGE difference in heavy ammo most* of the time
also blast furnace is ridiculous
like the stability is absurd
"oh yeah, you still need outbreak"
the range is absurd
the gun is a laser
Yeah blast furnace is my fave legendary
and yes i should grab outbreak really quick thanks for reminder
i'd recommend bringing a fireteam for zero hour
uh yes i could use some help lol

It looks so good in motion!  For a 10 year old game especially
"Watching a stream, it kinda feels like Destiny"
god has it been 10 years
"I thought it was 2009 but it's actually 2010, so it's been 9-ish years"
nah i didn't get in. from what i hear the selection at the moment is extremely narrow
supposedly this first flight is to make sure the flighting system works lol
"Makes sense, Microsoft flights are very heavily regulated"
"Oh man the scout rifle the dude is using is so good, that's what D2 scouts should feel like"
who are you watching?
Ubernick

lmaoo same
oh man that looks fun
Man I forgot you could fly in Halo
finally got another roll on retold tale and it has the EXACT same perks as my current
"Wow, Nighthawk is OP in Osiris story. One-shot the boss (from strike, not penoptis)"
nighthawk is just op in general but yes
is there a way to re-post the lfgcreate down here?
Oh man the systems I'm working with right now has SLI-d Titan Xp and I'm so tempted to install Destiny to see how high the frames can go
I think the lfgcreate warns people when the time is nigh?
I just figured there was an hour left and I wanted to refresh the lfg down here so we could maybe get a 4th
an hour left? i thought it was about to start
i was off by an hour i guess
7pm CST which is 8pm EST
gonna need to push it back just a tad in that case
yeah i could have sworn it said 6pm for me (cst)
i'm just blind
!lfg alert 538
@Thawxtem you can do !lfg edit 538
!lfg edit 538
@RonInDune that did nothing
do the alert thing again
see if it has updated time
"wait, what are you trying to do?"
what am i trying to do?
!LFG search 538
i'm just probably gonna eat dinner at about 7 but it won't take long
that's what I was trying to achieve. thanks
i mean if you really don't want to wait then go ahead without me if you have someone else
did we need to change times?
just by like 20 minutes? maybe 30 tops?
later?
yes 20-30 minutes later
beautiful
sorry for the bother
alright i'm good to go
"I am almost ready, will be on shortly"
^ same
75 mote
over the whole match
so half of the ones for the match
Do we have enough people to try for a heroic menagerie later tonight?
im able to
"Family time, sorry"
Ah well we can try tomorrow otherwise
https://youtu.be/HGzL7kAALUw?t=95 @Thawxtem
film grain
skip to 1:35 if the link doesn't for you
I remember film grain in Mass Effect made the game look so weird in indoor settings sometimes
Especially during the elevator sequences
yeah that's the game i mentioned earlier to thawx to try to give an example lol
I remember the first Max Payne had it too I think? But it looked so cool I didn't care
it was really obvious in the citadel and on that tropical planet
I've basically been playing destiny with film grain at max for the past 3 months.
you poor soul
And now everything is clear
"I can see clearly now, the grain is gone 🎵"
My most important destiny setting is the fov
I found 105 FOV  to be the best
i might have to leave the clan because you guys barely laugh at my jokes and that's just a deal breaker
but yes fov is super important
"Alright i'm back, what shall I do tonight"
I think i'll play some destiny :))
"To get the triumph for doing menagerie with the full armour set, do we have to keep wearing it throught the encounter?"
I'm not sure :S
How was gambit?? Did you guys get the triumph??
"Yeah, first match"
"Holy cow, congrats"
"holy crap, nice!!"
We were able to pull matos
"ah, that's good"
I literally have never changed my fov
you should do it
Initially it feels like you're running faster
But you get used to it
"Hey @Pentan , i dont really have anything im doing right now - want to grab outbreak?"
"i really appreciate the offer but i gotta leave in about 7 hours, already up way too late 😂"
gn lads
night!
This roll has been my white whale for a while now... Sureshot/Ricochet/Zen Moment/Outlaw with Range MW
This is replacing JQK3 for my energy slot HC now
It feels so crisp
Damn that's a solid roll
Zen Moment fixes the weird Vigil recoil too so the bounce is minimized and it's just so fucking good
"Hmm I'll see if I can get those same rolls for an Austringer, I've been grinding that and Beloved for a while now"
Still chasing my Beloved roll
I accidentally sharded a No distractions/Moving Target roll and feel pretty bad about it
I'm looking for Snapshot/Quickdraw
i got an okay Snapshot/Moving Target one but really want to minmax it lol
Why quickdraw? Is the timing that helpful?
For Beloved it just makes the gun feel super snappy
If I need to quickly swap to snipe then other snipes take a long time to draw out
"Quickdraw makes it very, well, quick. Pair that with the 2nd lowest zoom scope and a good AA value, Beloved is a great snipe for me"
Also TLW can be paired with it
"Oh that's a good combo, never thought about that pairing"
I paired TLW with a pulse
i got in a fight with a lake today
i lost btw
many different parts of my body are red for many different reasons
Uh.... I have questions?
shoot
How and why?
mostly tubing
got rubbed raw in several places by this awful tube
"also i got several sunburns, mostly on the backs of my legs. never been burnt there before, but it's bad"
and falling off the tube while going about 30mph hurts a lot if you didn't know
my muscles are also no longer working properly until further notice
i was on the water for about 6 hours and probably spent more time on the tube than in the boat
This is what you get for going outside. Honestly.
"I'm not gonna be on destiny for a while, will be visiting some family."
I'll be online on discord and stuff though
"Sounds good man, have a good time!"
"Currently on a road trip until the 10th, but I've got my laptop with so I'll be able to do some stuff in a pinch"
Have fun @Trissin ! I'll look after the kids for ya!
time to start the rebellion
:BAguns:
Who among us shall lead the rebellion?
:sepiksgoogly:
i could use some help with either the outbreak quest or the bow quest in the shattered throne
i have the 3 tokens or coins or whatever and i think the next step is in the shattered throne
nobody wants to help me 😢
"@Pentan I may have someone, including myself, could you enter voice chat?"
@Thawxtem yeah sorry i stepped away for a minute but i'm good now
i'm in voice
Sorry I'm hanging out with friends
"Don't worry Oath, we got his outbreak"
yeah i got outbreak now
that was a lot harder than i expected
Nice congrats!
from what i hear the masterwork is a pain
Don't forget to start trying to masterwork it!
yeah...
"Not really, it's just a bit tedious and you'll need 3 people to do it fast"
how do i get masterwork to drop exactly? do i need a quest or what?
Nah you have to run the mission 3 more times on 3 different weeks on heroic
"You'll have to pick up a mission item at the start of the run, follow a slightly different path, and have to solve a *long* puzzle at the end"
Did you get to do it blind @Pentan ?
trevor is now my least favorite person
Doing it blind alongside @Trissin was one of my fave destiny experiences
You know true fear
I CAN SHOW MY BUDDY TREVOR
YOU GUYS HAVE JUST MADE MY NIGHT
yw
thanks for the help tonight thawx. we'll have to keep going another time
i'm exhausted and i've gotta be up tomorrow
🇨🇦🇨🇦HAPPY🇨🇦🇨🇦CANADA🇨🇦🇨🇦DAY🇨🇦🇨🇦
":o lumina is going live today, isn't it?"
"No, tomorrow"
lmk how it goes!
i need some help with shattered throne before reset kicks in
need to finish up my bow quest
Sure I can help tonight
anybody else?
ill likely be available
coolio beans
Far enough south to be hearing those southern accents
no idea what you're on about mate
i just got the new warlock exotic helmet as well as huckleberry catalyst from the same daily heroic adventure
go do huckleberry catalyst!! It's a good gun for pve
I'm traveling. 😂
"Huckleberry is real good, and the catalyst is super easy to do"
now the only warlock exotic i don't have is getaway artist
"Yeah finish up the Huck catalyst ASAP, it takes the gun from being merely pretty good to absolute god-tier"
i don't have enough weapon parts to pull it from collections lol
Weaponsmith parts is one thing I have way to much of
This Wendigo quest is silly. 1500 is just too damn high.
**AGREE**
"Running 3 grenade launchers is the way to go honestly, even then it's such a chore"
I mean it finally gives me an excuse to grind out my fighting lion catalyst but still. Urgh.
yeah it's bonkers
i was just running a heavy launcher and lion because that's all i have
i've always just turned in my weapon parts because i never thought they'd be good for anything except maybe getting a good roll on something
and then i learned about black armory
now i turn them into mod components
@RonInDune @Buttkikker you good to go for shattered throne in like 10 minutes?
Oh sorry no I'm still at work for another couple of hours
Let me finish this strike and i'll run throne.
alright good stuff
im good to go
"give me a few, taking care of my doggo"
@Buttkikker we're ready
who should i join on?
"if anybody has sudden onset feelings of self hatred and wants to do the heroic mission for outbreak, then @me"
@Pentan I can be on in a minute
My only condition is to suffer through Menagerie once with me
id love to get a heroic menagerie going before reset
I'll be in fireteam chat
idk i just started playing stardew and kinda crashed. i really didn't get much sleep last night after our shattered throne run
don't really have the emotional energy to put myself through heroic menagerie rn lol
I wasn't asking heroic
i'm just gonna chill for the rest of the night. thanks anyway thawx
gravitation lance catalyst!
Nice!!!!
im so sorry for you
it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks to do
what is it
I've heard masterworking is an excellently pleasant experience
you need 1000 kills with the cosmology perk
I remember it was horrible in y1 but I think it's much better now
was it even worse then?
don't even know what that is... haven't used it in so long
when you kill somthing little particles fly out and explode
it can cause a chain reaction to very low hp enemies but your average acolyte is fine
Farm it either in Blind well or the whisper mission infinite thrallway
Lucked out and randomly qued in a group farming Wendigo in blind well. So thats done now at least!
How's the lumina quest???
just started
its interesting so far
"Also, strange terrain is a nightfall this week for those who need it!"
It's osprey week
Heard it's a long and grindy go
But I couldn't log in at all due to saxophone errors so I'll see later tonight
Ooh ok
Also the grimoire vol 2 is for sale now
I'll order asap
I heard there's a discount with the emote
Yah but I couldn't log in so that'll have to wait
"yeah i got the message on login. @RonInDune @Trissin if you buy the new emote, you get 20% off the grimoire"
i spent so much time grinding for light when i did most of my playing in year 1 and early forsaken that it feels weird to not care about weekly reset for any reason other than raids
the emote cost $10 worth of silver though lol RIP
Eh considering how cool it looks I'm fine with it
yes it looks great but i'm not paying $10 for an emote
"like if i was gonna get the book too, then sure because it probably almost cancels out"
i'll just get it from loot pool eventually
Ah I see yeah I'm definitely getting the book so it makes sense for me
dreaming spectrum best shader
I don't think itll be in the loot pool tangerine
never?
"also yes, dreaming spectrum best shader THANK YOU"
probably never
well damn. i'll just live without it
Dreaming Spectrum is not the best shader
what's better
"Midnight Smith, Meyrin, Cinderchar, one of the new Gambit ones I can't remember, Metro Shift, Gift of the Nine are just some examples"
"Dreaming Spectrum is good, don't get me wrong, but those IMO are better"
Spectrum shades weird on a lot of things
gift of the nine is also pretty great
but it's no dreaming spectrum
"Gift shades damn near everything without any issues, Spectrum has issues"
"aight fine, broken combos aside, dreaming spectrum is the shit"
which is dreaming spectrum all i can think of is blueshift dreams
i think it's from last wish?
"Still disagree, the when spectrum looks good others still look better IMO"
Not trying to knock the choice or anything lol
Very nice shader when it works
I really do like the new opulence shaders as well
But that's a big *when*
ok i just got it off of a bad chattering bones roll
Imperial dress is pretty cool
ill have to take a look at it
Man I want trials to come back
Not that I'm good at PvP in any capacity
But the loot is cool
i dunno im not a huge fan of the color purple in the first place but it looks really good on threat level
and on the COS armor
Imperial dress looks really wonky on some things lol
oh i meant dreaming spectrum dont think i have imperial dress
oh ok ok
Trissin
i see the appeal just the purple is too dark
Why did you have to mention Trials
Now I'm sad
i just realized i never got the ascendant chests around the dreaming city
The best is the bright pink shader on the fluffy balloon like spire armour
Actually turn into the creature from Ghostbusters
Nebula rose?
just got boss spec from a world drop misfit
boss spec or boss resist
boss spec
I suppose a weapon can't drop with a resist mod....
"That's nice I guess, but can't you buy those from Banshee?"
oh idk
"i thought it was the rare one, but what do i know"
"Yeah, pretty sure boss resist is the rare one"
It has a tiny chance to come on reckoning gambit armor
i guess that makes more sense :derp:
"alright. for the record, i just counted and double checked my glimmer, and there are 15 chests on the barge. total cost to open all of them is 75k glimmer"
How many Imperials do u get from it?
150 per chest
2250 then?
33.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 glimmer per imperial
I like the precision
thank
"i wanted to do more but there's a 2,000 character limit on discord messages"
crazy
you guys had a ted talk on shaders
and bergusian night nor artic pearl were mentioned
what a world
Tru bergusian night is a good one
rasmussen clan is better imo
but arctic pearl idk 🤔
but like i said not one for purple
pffft
PFFFFT
how's the Lumina Quest?
Apex season 2 starts today so  that will keep me busy
lumina quest is a bit grindy so far but enjoyable
"wouldn't know, i'm forever grinding for a god roll retold tale"
Apparently the tracking on the healing ball is insane
It'll literally do a 180 to track someone
"I just started it, and the second step is 250 orbs generated. I'm already half way through that."
ez on blind well
i did it with a masterworked riskrunner
I loaded into a public event on titan and got 100
Lumina is stupid busted in PvP
20% damage buff
For both people
Plus instant healing
"Lumina/Shotgun is gonna be the one meta setup, TLW/Snipe will be the other"
Whoa
20% damage buff?
so are we gonna have somebody in every raid running melting point/tractor cannon AND lumina?
"I think it depends on damage output, because buffing all other 5 players by 20 is equivalent to just doing damage directly"
Yeah it's like middle tree void titan with the shield
"We'll see how long the buff lasts, if it's easy to do, and whether or not we'll actually need the healing during damage phase"
The real question
Is does lumina trigger benevolent dawn?
The Warlock ability regen? If it does it'll be crazy
So much healing
"i really doubt it, but that would be busted"
the description just says healing or buffing allies
"i mean, if the ability works exactly as described, then yes, but i still really doubt it"
"To trigger a noble round it's the same as thorn, right? Kill something, pick up the remnant, and the next hip-fired round is noble?"
"The warlock healing rift is hilariously busted in the shattered throne with the right mods, I left a trail of rifts almost all the way around the room"
Lool
It's be fun to try the gun there
In the morgeth fight
ron what are you talking about?
"""what are healing rifts? I only know empowering rifts"""
"If you have some Taken Invigoration mods, stack them and then kill some yellow or orange bars"
you get your rift back instantly
"If you have more than one person with you, then even one mod is enough"
or you could do the same as hunter and get your dodge back instantly! that would be so crazy! imagine having dodge up 24/7! :travelergoogly: :ecksdee:
i always have dodge up 24/7
cus i never use it
i really do feel bad for hunters though
aside from the one tree where they proc camo on dodge it's pretty useless
yeah honestly it's pretty easy to perma invis most of the way through throne
"my buddy Littlepants did that for PvP, he put on sixth coyote and a bunch of Paragon mods"
pair that with lord of wolves (or any shotgun really) and that's pretty terrifying
looks like i've got a bit of time to hop onto destiny
"Oh cool, when will you be on?"
Anybody up for a 50k nightfall quick?
I need to farm Strange Terrain for Wayfarer
But I can't come right now sorry
i might be able to help out ari
Awesome. We should get you to that step first though
"i just picked up the quest in edz, gotta do the lost sector"
Has anyone figured this out yet?
https://twitter.com/Cozmo23/status/1146169065745989632
😮 i wonder what it is
@Oathbreaker tell us!!!!
Honestly have no clue
"Might be bows, could be damn near anything"
"The 20% buff makes things pretty strong, Ace can 2 tap with Mori active"
Hmm hmm a likely story
It also makes Thorn ticks do 9 damage instead of 7 with its buff active
would 20% be enough for fusion grenade one hits?
been a long time since i've even tried them
I don't think so
anybody wanna play some comp? haven't touched it since season 2 and one match by accident a couple days ago
i'm not sure if i want to so i'll let you guys decide. anybody wanna run last wish?
Got work tomorrow morning so I'm out for that
yeah it doesn't look like anyone wants to
just carried a comp match so hard. had a kd of 4.0 with 32 kills and my teammates kds were .47 and .53. both teams only had 3 players the whole game
we won 45-44
just published a novel in general chat
Ah truly the GRRM of our times
What the heck why are shipping costs so high on the bungie store!!!!
thats so expensive
wait did you get the discount from the emote?
These rates are insane!
Yeah I did
wow what the heck
Are these normal rates do you know?
Cause I never actually bought anything physical from the bungie store
Last time I got the grimoire from amazon at half the cost
"Oh, I don't know! I don't think I've bought anything from the bungie store"
Shipping was okay for me I guess the last time I ordered from them
See all this was much easier when I was in India
The shops just refused to sell at all
Anyone down for grinding Strange Terrain for a bit?
Also finish up the ||Rose quest step||
@RonInDune you still up for Strange Terrain?
Gimme a sec to log in
We'll need one more
"Also, for lore hunters, I think ||using Rose, even the unfinished version, gives lore drops. Just like Thorn||"
"Also for lore hunters, Tangled Shore is flashpoint, which unlocks some lore for Chronicler title for this week only"
@RonInDune mind entering chat?
"RonInDune and Thawxtem are in fireteam chat, ready to do strange terrain, but we need 1 more"
@WookieeEater Icarus?
IT WORKS WITH BENEVOLENT DAWN!!!!!!!!
Holy crap
Congrats btw!
gg ez
dawnblades have infinte grenades now
"going to see spider man, i'll let ya'll know how it is"
i'm sure it's great tho
Make sure to buy some glimmer from him
😂 that's the dumbest joke i've heard this week but i actually laughed
good stuff
Hey anyone down for grinding Strange terrain nightfall for a bit?
With me and @Thawxtem
I can help
Perfect thanks a lot ari!
Let me finish this forge and I'm ready
We're Clan Level 5!!!!!!
Time for getting ALL THE CATALYSTS!
wait what does the level 5 perk do exactly?
if it gives you catalysts that's actually busted
Increases Crucble and strike catalyst drops when doing them with a clanmate
that's pretty nice
Someone on reddit said it's a 30% increase but I don't know how that works
@Buttkikker that's a good game you got there. before Penitent Tangerine my name on all my platforms was either BloonsDestroyer or Bloons113744 since i was like 10 years old
its fun
coop just came out so im playing a ton
What kind of game is it?
tower defense and strategy primarily
i suppose
yeah its really well made for a tower defence game
"huh I'll try it out then, the only tower defence I played for any stretch was Sanctum 2"
defense*
yeah i recommend it
"for those that don't know, bloons tower defense (btd) started out as a flash game on ninja kiwi. other sites hosted it like coolmathgames so as kids most of us played it during computer time at school. i think btd4 was the last flash version of the game and btd5 and 6 are both steam games"
5 was both
"looks like it's part of the summer sale. btd6 is 30% off, but you could probably get it cheaper on g2a or kinguin if anyone was interested"
Btd was my childhood
I think I started with 2
"Hey so I think @WookieeEater asked me yesterday, but here's a complete collection of all the lore books from Forsaken in a neat, well-formatted pdf file:"

Anyone down to farm strange terrain maybe this weekend?
Anyone on the Lumina step wher you have to do activities with Rose equipped?
I'd load into lake of shadows. I know I did and ended up running into a fireteam of 2 doing it that I was able to join up with and finish that step
Good idea that
The step after is super easy too
im trying to get the 200 runes slotted before the thing is patched
but it's slowwwww
What're you at?
Currently 96
I'm on 91
But I only have 2 slots lol
You got a few more days. How you doing on imperials?
Low :(((
Oh dear
What do I need Imperials for?
To kill the stormcloaks
(also to upgrade chalice to 3rd slot)
kill stormcloaks? What
Makes the 200 go faster
Skyrim joke 🤣
Ouuuu lmao
Hmm so I had an interesting rumble game
Literally all bots
Wow
That's crazy
Did you get the triumph trissin?
I'll do some mengerie with you later otherwise
"No not yet, I went to go take a shower lol"
I think I'm at 140 or something now
That pretty close!
"Yeah, I'll get it before it's patched I think"
"I'm done for today but I might be on tomorrow or something, we'll see"
When does it get patched?
next reset
I'll grind it out tomorrow then
the 9th
I'm actually pretty close to shadow!
a lot closer than I expected
Oh woow
"I'm still yet to do heroic menagerie though, so I don't know how difficult that will be. Do you need to 3 man it for the title?"
Noope
oh what
Just need to kill all 3 bosses without anyone dying
ohh that's not bad at all
damn i'm also yet to run crown this week... gotta do that 3 times before the reset
hope i can pick up tarrabah
We'll see if I can get it before you Trissin
You're on
Can we do a couple of Crown runs this weekend? I really want the final Chronicon lore piece!
Hmm I didn't know The Big Show was a hunter main. This changes everything.
https://twitter.com/WWETheBigShow/status/1136739551534358536
i'm down for crown
"good news: I ordered an SSD, and if all goes as planned I shall no longer have the potato computer!"
I don't think I'll be able to run Crown until monday
but good luck you guys!
ssds are life
sadly like 2/3 of the load times in destiny are server related
"but i only very rarely have to load new zones when sparrowing around on ssd, and spawning in out of orbit after the ships fly down is instantaneous. those are the 2 big differences i think"
"also some menu stuff probably, like checking different parts of your inventory and character screens"
although that might be in RAM 24/7
Anybody for a Nightfall?
Ooooh next week is mayhem
Time to pull out the colony
"Also, not sure if you're still looking @Samakain but I just logged in"
Gimme 5 and i'd love to
Ready to go whenever bud.
"Next week Mayhem? Perfect, might get some MT progress done"
When you carry so hard but still lose.
at least it's qp
My back fucking hurts from that game
Citadel is hands down worst map in the game
Lol getting lumina bugged out my kinetic slot
It's now empty
what happens if you switch to kinetic?
It equips
if all of your kinetic slots are full it adds one for it
Holy crap this nova clip I just found on Reddit
😂 😂 😂
those things are relentless 😂
So I've been farming Beloved and is no distractions/moving target with drop mag/extended barrell good enough to keep?
"Also have a snapshot sights/rampage, but that doesn't seem right"
Maybe take a look at this? https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/06/29/the-god-rolls-you-should-be-farming-before-destiny-2s-menagerie-chest-dies/
disagree with the shotty roll tho
Also @Trissin just finished the Rolling Deep triumph for 200 runes slotted
Probably shouldn't have done that during blackout but whatever
we gonna raid any time soon? need me some crown stuff
I'm good monday
If not a raid then do we have people for a heroic menagerie?
About to do scrims 😦
You guys could probably do a raid as well I think !
"So there was one extra person in the scrims, so I've stepped out. Would anyone be interested in doing a Mindbenders 100k Nightfall? Trying to farm without the 100k bonus makes me sad because of RNG being cruel"
I can join in in about 10 minutes
Sounds good
Might have a group
finally finished the 200 runes triumph
Hmm.. how do you get the opulent menagerie armor?
Is it a recipe?
"ah okay, I see"
https://imgur.com/gallery/NRvSeJQ
"ooh okay, thank you!"
"Bottom row, not the exodus down stufd"
"So I need the armor, a few weapons, and the flawless heroic menagerie bosses, and next week's crown challenge"
Ooh what was this week's challenge?
I think that'll be it for shadow!
Dang man
This week's challenge is total victory
"So that's for the 3rd encounter, the deception"
I'm pretty sure you have to break the deception's shield 5 times in a single damage phase
(anarchy mwahahaha)
Oh okay then I'm definietly doing it with you on Monday lol
lool yes let's do it
World's first shadow let's go!
😄 gotta wait for the heroic menagerie flawless bosses though
"Also for the menagerie, after grinding for so many hours, it honetly felt like the charts were much easier to use than the app"
Like I can see what going on here here at a glimpse: https://imgur.com/a/U1b3PfP
"Yeah, I think so too"
ron why can i not help but read all of your messages in your voice
lol thanks
i don't think there's a single other person on the planet that i read their messages in their voice
no one comes to mind anyway
my brain really goes out of it's way to to weird shit to me without me signing a consent form
Oh man I was looking at GuardianCon footage and there's so many easter eggs!
"Lots of exotics hidden everywhere, according to reddit."
"like someone found ""no time to explain"""
I saw photos of the new exotic lmg
"don't ask me why i played during the halloween event and didn't get thunderlord, because i don't have an answer to that question"
"i can confirm, however, that it will not drop from fated engrams"
@Pentan does that mean you have to get it from just random exotic drops??
"Also, not sure if people have seen the announcement for Bungie Day and upcoming moments of triumph: http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47975"
"@Trissin yup, world drops only"
Guys you can get Hive Armaments from the menagerie!!!
Get tae farming
OH MY GOD.
It's from power and efficiency 3
Only off powerful drops though
So nine shots at it a week plus raid drops
That's still pretty good
Yeah cause there are only so many mods available
Wish there was something like this for the fallen
You can get fallen armaments from scourge
They're really useful lol
Yeah but I've done scourge thousands and thousands of time and still haven't got any
I got my first set of taken armaments pretty recently
"Ok checking raid report i've done it twice, but eh close enough"
Looool
I really want the sparrow
"Not only does it look cool, but it's actually better than other ones too"
So the only things I want left from Menagerie is armor
I still haven't completed the race section even once
:o sword @Oathbreaker ?
Managed to get a Quickdraw/Snapshot Beloved
THE HELL IS WITH ALL YOU GUYS AND SWORDS
NO
NEVER
@Arixama
I HAVE POCKET DAWNBLADE AND THAT'S THE ONLY SWORD I'LL EVER *WANT* TO USE
But I'm pretty sure you need the sword for the collections badge
and you need that for Shadow
_and also hey it's not a bad sword so_
"Shadow requires a sword? No thanks, I'll pass"
It's for completing heroic managerie
stop with the swords
Never
"Forget *""NO CAPES!""

*""NO SWORDS""*"
https://tenor.com/YsUt.gif
Perfect gif Trissin
Pshh
Swords rule! Guns drool!
Have you guys seen anything about vicious circle?
what's vicious circle?
The rooster teeth thing?
"Yeah, basically four people are fighting to collect 75 things, and one person plays a giant chicken monster trying to kill all of them."
"Either everyone gets killed by the chicken and the chicken wins, or one person is able to evac and win the round. Rinse and repeat for 5 rounds."
"Hmm, looks kinda like a mixture of Evolve and Overwatch"
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfhJHM1HLzU||
OH RIGHT
"If you die, you can still go out and kill the other players and take over their bodies"
"It looks real fun, but I didn't actually get a chance to play it"
@RonInDune Tomorrow I'll be doing my strnage terrain farming if you're still up for it
"Ari helped me and thawx grind it out already so I'm good, but I can help you!"
Also I'd really love to do the raid and the challenge tomorrow
"^
Yep, I'm still on for that. When are people free?"
Anytime after 7 CST
_(Time is flexible as always)_
"I hope to be ready, but I want to install my SSD that comes in today first, so I’m willing to drop out if need be"
"I am possibly available, I'll have to see how my connection is at the hotel and when we get there"
why is getting blue runes so difficult
are they extra rare or something?
I asked that at the beginning; I believe it’s because they give you the new/rarer gear
I just want a good Erentil Bungie
Is that so much to ask?
doing strange terrain farm if anyone is down
Alright I'm logging in now for the raid!
Do we have enough?
im ready to go
"Ari's online, so it seems we have 4"
but as far as i know were short
@PC Crown of Sorrow + Challenge!
"Hesitant to join any Crown of Sorrows till Trissin gets his Terrabah, till he gets one I don't do Crown.... I remember what he said about me and potentially getting Anarchy before him monkaS"
Thawxtem and Ron both have it
It's ok I'll personally make sure he doens't get one
Yeah but you didn't say anything about kicking them if they got raid exotics before you
I have 4 other people who heard you say that about me 😃
"it's all good oath, i got my anarchy"
if youre busy tonight or if you just dont feel like joining its all good lol
no obligations or anything
"(If I wasn't clear I'm joking)

~~not really~~"
"Yeah maybe, had a long shift today but might be able to join"
I want to finish this managerie run I'm doing quick to make sure I'm actually stable
lol all good
btw do you need the bounty for the challenge or do you get the triumph regardless
I believe you need to turn in the bounty to get the triumph
ok good to know
Just turned on my computer after putting in SSD for the first time
i trust it was enlightening
"Well, all I’ve done is slot it in. It’s still blank. I still have to re-install battle.net on it in order to use it for Destiny, yes?"
Did you have to fully reinstall windows?
"Hmm, maybe it'd be better to do another time"
The raid?
Man I really want the challenge lol
Do we have 5?
"Not sure, I think it depends on thawx's computer"
Worst case scenario is we can do the challenge the next time it comes around
what challenge?
This week's challenge for crown of sorrow
I can just load slow Destiny I guess. Just a little hyped about new drive
You can just move destiny to the new hard drive
"""You can just copy paste the destiny folder on the SSD, and locate the install folder afterwards from the bnet launcher."""
"Yeah, you should just be able to migrate D2 over to the new drive no issue"
According to reddit
I've played off of an external hard drive before
"Yeah it's a simple move, nothing can possibly go wrong"
If thawxtem joins us we've got 5
"If Oath joins, then 6?"
That would be correct
Seems that we don't have enough people
I think i'm just gonna log off for tonight
ok night
Ah well we'll try again this weekend
G night
"Yeah, sounds good"
"Sorry, been messing around with my keyboard"
If you guys want a 6th I'll be in
@Thawxtem @Arixama are you guys good to join?
1 min. If this doesn’t work I’ll just join on and save drive for later
"I should be able to, just won't be able to talk."
That's fine
Go ahead and join up on me when youre ready then
"Yeah it's all good, we did nightfalls without voice after all"
What class is needed?
"I don't think it matters too much, as long as we have 1 warlock we are ok"
Dibs
I'll go Titan then
I'll also be running warlock
We're in the voice channel ari
@Thawxtem see this: https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/239471195
"ship load times are server loads,and after that is hard drive based"
"so when we were running nightfalls the other night, i had a black screen for a bit while we were waiting for you to load in"
"ship load times will be pretty much the same, but after that your zone load time will definitely be improved"
Does that translate to strikes as well?
"partially.  once the ships zoom down to the planet, thats when youll see the improved load times"
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/548743463202717706/597995841919123466/outfuckingstanding.PNG
finally got this week's heroic menagerie flawless
"it's pretty hard, but not impossible with a good team"
grats!
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47978
Outbreak change is dumb
||hearing Bad Juju is on Io||
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
||ok lots of misinformation everywhere: now people reporting opening chests on nessus barge gives the bad juju quest||
Fuck me I'm gunna have to do this at the hotel tonight 😭
||It's a chest by Werner not one of the main ones||
"Very spoilerific: ||To start Bad Juju""You need to complete and place a total of 18 tributes in the tribute hall - including the 5 doggo tributes you get by filling the hall. Once you've placed the 5 dogs the central chest in the tribute hall unlocks and you start an adventure in the ascendant plane. I'm in the mission now, there's a raid banner and tolan dialogue."" - from r/raidsecrets||"
||Such a weird looking gun: ||
||people have already acquired it??||
||It's no outbreak sadly||
||I'll try to get that done soon then||
||I hope it's as good as it was in d1||
"||Not meant to be a boss killer, it's always been meant for hard add clear||"
"||Requires a **lot** of planetary mats though damn, no way I'm finish the gun and the catalyst anytime soon||"
"||oh crap, how many mats are we talking here||"
||A stupid amount. Like thousands. But if you do the 4 bounties Calus offers it lowers the cost by a percent per bounty.||
||holy crap||
Yeah DIM's down as well
!dance
||Got it! It feels realllyyyy goood :))||
Amazing did you really have so many mats???
I had a lot of tribute hall stuff already
thats pretty cool
Oh man can get some people to just run all the raid once today? That gives some tributes I think
i dont think u have to do it all in one day
and im pretty sure those are retrospective
I know but ..........
I want it now lol
^^^
i mean id be down to run a few not sure about all
it looks really cool in game
wat armor set is that?
are those transmats?
or ornaments
rather
The armor is from Y1 solstice of heroes
"I just did some testing with ||bad juju||, it's kind of insane."
im excited to see wat the solstice armour is gonnebe thise year
"||So here's how it is. The string of curses perk stacks up to 5x, and the more stacks you have, the more super energy generated per kill.||"
"|| Naturally I went to the thrallway to see how strong it is. I popped my super and then wiped to reset my super bar to 0. I cleared 2 waves of shadow thrall in 27 seconds, and my super was full.||"
"|| I counted 31 kills, but this was all at 5x string of curses (except for the first 4 kills, of course)||"
"Hmm, wonder if masterworking improves that even more"
I really wonder what the catalyst will do
It's already very strong
"Gladd's about to get it, I'll check and tell you"
wait how do you get it
45 tributes
||go talk to mecha calus||
that's not too bad. I'll get that done soon
@Jump spoiler tags
Its a spoiler?
||Is bad juju the new weapon?||
||so the catalyst extends the duration of string of curses||
I JUST GOT UP AND MISSED THIS
WHY BUNGIE WHY
@Trissin ||people are saying there's a secret firefly effect on bad juju did you notice that?||
||https://clips.twitch.tv/EntertainingSpikyHareNerfBlueBlaster||
||the catalyst makes string of curses last a couple seconds more||
seems kinda underwhelming
might be godly in the crucible though hmm
But also generates orbs of light and gives you more time between kills if you need it
yea i hope its good for crucible
Can't wait to get home and grind it out!
for sure
"It's designed for ad clear, I don't think it's gonna be popular for pvp"
the bounties arent that bad
sad
well a ||pulse rifle|| for pve is still good with me
Also I didn't get the random firefly to proc @RonInDune
maybe its a bug?
I doubt that
We'll see I guess
had an animation that ive not seen before
I mean i have yet to get the weapon and try it out
so we'll see
you guys really like your black ink don't you
nO sPOilErS
yikes...
what exactly is a yike
and why are they only seen in groups
So the With Both Hands challenge is pretty easy
what do you need to do?
One person shoot one hand during final boss
So the two people in each team just shoots one hand each before dps phase
And what about during damage phase?
"Everyone shoots one hand I think, but it's a bit confusing still"
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8SrJgVKwA0||
Okay I got it
Can we try tonight?
so for the new triumphs (specificly the collections and triumph score ones) do you need to do it again if you have already done what it says?
im down to try @RonInDune
Yeah if we get enough people we can teach @Jump crown
thank you sir
im gonna power level now then
You're fine
I think 710+ when you start is fine
exotics dont have random rolls right
armor does
so if i have a duplicate i should dismantle it right?
Its probably not going to matter in September anyway
thats true
i havent really bothered with armor rolls as i have with weapon rolls
Can we do 9:30 for the raid?
I can’t make 9 even 9:30 is a bit of a question mark
"Time is flexible, we'll see if that works for others"
OK the solstice vehicles don't look nearly as good this year
There were amazing last time round
I guess they're the moments of triumph ones technically
Has the armour been upgraded?
"Solstice stuff isn't available yet, but the final tier this year has a slightly different model"
Ok let’s do a little past 9:30
Any chance you wanna join us @Nahkriin ?
So are we starting an hour from now?
"no, not quite an hour from now"
maybe 20 - 30 mins from now
alright that's good with me
Okie
Nahkriins on a different pc than his so he said he wont be able to
I think we'll need one more then
@PC anyone for crown?
"just in the middle of cooking lunch but if you can give me like 10, sure."
"yeah, of course"
i would be but i'm about to play some stardew with friends
all good @Pentan
good to go whenever
"Cool, go ahead and join up on Trissin when ready"
Sam and I are in the voice channel
@Buttkikker
My internet’s out I just reset it so I should be back soon
And my internet’s out again
I’ll reset it again but if you guys can find someone else feel free to finish
Oh man having the vault and having all those ammo packs and super regen in the tribute hall means there must be a fight somewhere there right?
Alright! Got ||Bad juju and did it solo flawless||
Dude ||the tribute hall is a shooting range!|| I didn’t even realize that!
"To everyone in the COS last night i'm so sorry for randomly leaving i just got my internet back up. I feel really bad for abandoning you guys, and would be happy to finish it whenever."
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cbbuhf/calusthemed_weapons_and_what_counts/
"Nooooo @Buttkikker you're all good! No need to apologize at all, if internet/computer/whatever is being wonky there's nothing we can do about it"
"Don't blame yourself for it, you played well and we'll get it done tonight."
anyone wanna run rats king or outbreak perfected today?
i still gotta get those
should give a nice bump
"Rat king won't, but outbreak will for sure"
"Give powerful gear, I mean"
Man ||bad juju has the worst range of any pulse I've ever used.|| it's literally less than my Austringer.
"Oh it's not THAT bad, you're just used to your precious blast furnace"
4-round aggressive frames will always have so much more range.
Ah I see
What was the 540 trials pulse?
Blast Furnace and Go Figure don't even have drop off except in PvE instances (with the exception of maybe 2 lanes)
I forgot the name
Darkest Before
that
The range on that wasn't great I think
About 40m from memory
... Still so strong though
Maybe high 30s
That's basically Bad Juju
Yeah blast furnace and scouts wreck in that one nine themed map
Eternity?
equinox
Yeah that
The best map
btw
Don't @ me
@Trissin Garbage map.
@Trissin best map
"youre a sniper oath, I thought you'd like it"
Garbage spawns
Map design encourages camping
Map design also ensures that you lose after your first wave of being spawn camped
Feels like that one CS 1.6 map with all the corridors
"oh, I see"
There are far better maps for sniping
"Despite all that, I still like the map because it looks cool and I like scout rifles lol"
Just realized that there must be some trials weapons that we can't get anymore right?
Correct
Unless you got Trials gear before it went away it's gone
Are there any really good ones?
"Darkest Before, OG Trials shotgun, one of the Hand Cannons, A Long Walk possibly are the best from there"
"Oh, and one of the scouts"
The End?
Is there another scout
"Idk, had Explosive Rounds"
How hard was it to get those? Lots of grind?
More or less RNG gated
Oh that's bad
Though I know Trials was kind of elite PvP
"I tried playing trials before lol, did not go well for me"
Did you get to the big floating head place?
"nope, only saw the bottom lool"
"Good guns from Trials were Judgement (Hand Cannon), Purpose (Scout Rifle), Darkest Before (Pulse Rifle), A Sudden Death (Shotgun), The Long Walk (Sniper Rifle)"
Ohh purpose
That's kinetic right?
Believe so
I don't have any on PC due to the switch and just never bothered with PvP
"Have Judgement, Darkest, Sudden Death, and The Long Walk on my Xbox account"
"Real sad though because there's no way to get them anymore, they're actually decent guns"
:(
"On a completely unrelated note, I saw a guy do a Damageless speedrun of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD and dear god was it the most heart stopping shit ever"
Damageless
"Whole thing took about 6 hours, as far as I'm aware he's the only one to have ever completed it"
I've seen hitless runs of Dark Souls and Resident Evil and they were too much
I understand flawless
But like damageless and hitless
It's insane
anybody want to do a highscore calus gear nightfall?
Yeah give me like 30 mins
Ron you available?
I'm really sorry I'll be late
Y’all wanna run cos today around same time as yesterday?
Or some other raid?
Yeah I'm down for raids
@Arixama Did you finish the nightfall stuff already?
"i got it but, would definitely be willing to do it again"
Did you go full calus themed?
"Yeah, Ari got it but not me -_-"
"i had on geomags, but other than that yeah. id suggest using all opulence stuff if you can, because for some reason oath didnt get it and he had all but 1 calus themed as well, so it might be finicky for some reason"
Ive got three of us that havent done any of the new raids and need to do them for Triumphs if you ahve room for raids
I''m sure we do!
by new i mean anything from Forsaken lmao i just started playing again this season
i burned out on Forsaken content right before the raid released haha
"Yeah we can swing that easy, trissin, ari, et al. have sherpad us through many of the raids so far"
that would be awesome
"^^
more than happy to take your group through any raids you'd like."
"Not sure if tonight is possible, but definitely will do."
yeah doesnt need to be tonight but any time basically before MoT is over hahaha
"Oh, yeah absolutely haha"
"Does the group from yesterday want to continue?
@RonInDune @Buttkikker @Samakain @Arixama @Jump"
im  good to
"If you do any raids tomorrow, let me know. I should be back home by 5."
yeah im good to go whenever
"will do @Nahkriin , what time zone are you in?"
Mountain
sadly some stuff has come up today and I cannot make it. Sorry!
"ah, no worries sam!"
are you okay if we continue without you?
"Or we could just run a different raid, do some other activities"
i mean ill run it again LOL
@Samakain
By all means guys!
Good hunting!
"Alright, one more for the final encounter of crown + challenge?"
"Just btw, there is a new player with us"
So it will likely take a few runs before we get it
Let's push to tomorrow then lol
im fine
awww
"Other option is @Sabre has a group of 3, we could do some of the new raids with them"
"Sure, a quick scourge run  is always great!"
"i'm gonna back out then, looks like you have 6"
Plus it's needed for the triumphs
I'd prefer you being there lol
I can drop out
my internet is likely to flunk out again so...
anyone wanna run nightfall?
I'm ready for the raids whenever
I just played a match with two Unbrokens in it and got absolutely shredded
sigh
"(This is a likely horrible attempt at humor)

Damn, you only had two? What I wouldn't do to get that lobby"
is that emile for ur icon? @Oathbreaker
Correct!
dude i cant wait for the pc version to come out
i heard theyre keeping it all the same even the mutliplayer systems
So hyped. Destiny is my addiction for PvP but MCC might just change that
facts!
im so down to join u when that comes out
ccant wait to beat all the story missions on legendary again
and i miss sword base
I miss Invasion
facts
343 has really destroyed the franchise
"I dunno about that. 4's MP was godawful, story was pretty okay for me. 5 was the inverse. Story was absolutely horrible while the MP was quite good IMO"
I lost faith in their story abilities but after 5's MP I have some faith left in their balancing abilities. Only some though. Automatics were too easy to use for so long
@RonInDune you still doing crucible because id love to join
"bad news. even after upgrade, loading time is still slow as ever."
😮 you guys playing some comp @Buttkikker @RonInDune ?
hmm i might hop in for a match or two
but i cant be on too long
lol im running comp soon too
Good luck then guys
"been helping someone else, what's been going on here?"
"Okay, any ideas on the best hand cannons for crucible competitive? I was aiming to use Ace, but apparently it's not as good as I thought it was"
fyi: trying to get Luna
either that or I need a lot of help getting to fabled
me and ron are going to be doing some comp if you would like to join us
when?
some point tommorow
"mmm kay, I'm going to a movie with family, but other than that I should be free"
"also, hand cannon suggestions?"
austringer is very good and versatile
but other than that i think its more based on what you have because it can be hard to get some of the hand cannons
for example spare rations ive heard is good but its hard to farm for
"thanks, I'll look at what I've got tomorrow. good night!"
Man i'd kill to be able to solo que in strikes
"Austringer, Ace, Thorn, Waking Vigil, Jack Queen King 3 are kind of my go to PVP hand cannons"
I highly recommend Ace is you don't normally use hand cannons
"It's got 5 perks rolled into one single gun. 

Third eye, High Cal Rounds, Firefly, Outlaw, Kill Clip for 6 bullets rather than 4 seconds"
"It has the longest range of any hand cannon barring Not Forgotten on it's new Mag Howl bullet, some of the highest flinch values in the game due to High Cal, has extremely high bullet magnetism and aim assist"
Austringer you need a fairly specific roll to be a good hand cannon for PvP. Hammer Forged or Full Bore/Accurized Rounds/Eye of the Storm/Rangefinder or Opening shot with Range MW
"Thorn has different recoil but if you get used to it, the gun becomes super lethal in lower comp levels."
"Waking Vigil has maybe 2 usuable rolls, period. All are gonna need Sureshot/Ricochet Rounds/Range MW. Your combo is basically gonna need to be Zen Moment and something else in this slot like Slideshot or Outlaw for this roll. Basically, where I normally wouldn't recommend Zen Moment on any gun, Waking Vigil has this weird bounce to its recoil that is mitigated by Zen Moment. Your next roll would be something like Opening Shot with Slideshot, Outlaw, or Snapshot sights."
"Don't bother with Spare Rations, getting Rose from collections is x100000 more time efficient due to how Reckoning weapon drops work. First, it's a layer of RNG to see if you get a gun. Second, it's another layer of RNG to see if you get the gun you want, third it's a layer of RNG to get good perks"
"Last Word is also extremely good within its 25m range before dropoff, the issue is that if you don't know how to use it (tap firing instead of holding down the trigger for the most part), TLW suffers hard from accuracy issues."
"If anyone has any PvP questions I'd be more than happy to answer them, whether it's about weapon rolls, strategies, armor perks, literally anything."
"If you guys want gameplay to see what I do when I'm having a good day so you have something to try and learn from, just let me know as well."
"As I've said a few times, I play way too much PvP for my own sanity."
"I'll be playing some comp soon as well, gotta climb back up"
"Another small perk of Ace is the radar stay up when you aim, which can be a life changer. 

Wish the snipers did that too but it'd probably be  bit too OP."
@Oathbreaker what's your opinion on curated nation of beasts for pvp
"Better rolls exist. Not the worst gun to use but getting a different roll, such as Hammer Forged, AccRounds, Outlaw, Kill Clip with Range MW is probably gonna be you best bet for Nation"
"It's not bad, but it could be much better."
whatever i'll take it lol
i've been using that and ace mostly for pvp as far as hand cannons go
"Kindled Orchid is also an okay PvP hand cannon, might not be what I prefer but it's a good energy slot option."
"thanks, i'll look into it the next time i'm on destiny"
No problem
i'm just sad that blast furnace is a thing now. i have an actual perfect roll on go figure
"got a pretty good blast furnace now too, but still, sad"
"If you prefer Go Figure, use it. Sometimes it's about the feel of the weapon too."
nah i definitely prefer my blast furnace. the thing is a laser. i was just proud of my go figure
It's why I can't stand Kindled Orchid. Something feels off about it. I prefer other Hand Cannons to it for some reason that can't be explained lol
Fair enough
the two weapons in question
"Honestly, could be a slightly better roll if I'm being real nitpicky for both. Go Figure you want Hi-Cal, Outlaw, Kill Clip but the roll you have is decent. Your Blast Furnace.... Not the best. Zen Moment by far is not a good perk on most guns with *some* very slight exceptions. Rampage is okay for PvE but for PvP it's by far miles better. No need to stack to get max damage."
"like i said, my blast furnace is *alright*"
"Oh yeah, both guns are good, just could be better lol"
I'm a perfectionist so I always look for the best possible rolls and all that unfun theory crafting stuff
i mean yeah that'd be nice but i just don't have the time and i definitely don't have the luck required to get those rolls
"i make what i have work pretty damn well for myself i think. like you said, it's about the feel"
Isn't ricochet strictly better than accurized @Oathbreaker ?
"It gives more range, just doesn't show it on the stat bar"
i looked into that and i don't think so but i'm by no means an expert
I don't remember if Ricochet can roll on NoB
I do personally prefer Ricochet
Give me a second
Yeah it can't
I remember seeing it somewhere that ricochet secretly gives more range than accurized
So that's why you want Acc Rounds
It does kinda. Like maybe a meter at most. It also slightly increases zoom
"In theory the pure range roll for Nation of beasts would be Full Bore, AccRounds, Opening Shot, Kill Clip"
Getting that exact roll is a stupid amount of RNG though so
just wanna be able to re-roll weapons like we did in d1
I don't want that again.
yeah i guess it is better now i'm just being lazy
It would be the part of House of Wolves I hated. Needing to reroll to get the *perfect* roll just to be able to compete.
wat about better devils?
i quite like that one
still prefer ace over it but still
"hasn't been relevant since season 1 that i've heard, but really i'm no expert"
"There are better options than Better Devils, but regardless, big range roll would be Sureshot, AccRounds, Rangefinder, Opening shot"
anyone wanna run a nightfall
i gotta get the weekly rewards and lumina
Outlaw or Rangefinder are your two best first column perks while Opening Shot or Kill Clip are your two best second column perks
"So, I discovered that there was lore hidden in the Reckoning. I want to get it all, but I don't want to abandon my teammates. Is there a group here that would be interested in doing Reckoning for lore? Most is still on board the ship, 10 pieces, and it only goes up to tier 2"
Oh yeah for sure
Plus the Dust lore pieces are fascinating
ill join as well
also @Jump I would be willing to do nightfall if you're willing to do the Will of Thousands. I wanted the projection
"@Thawxtem the nightfall exclusive isn't a projection, it's a transmat effect"
"that what I meant, sorry"
I know ghost projections didn't exist back then
"So it turns out that going on the ship for the Nine quests still bring up the lore pieces, and the others can be easily obtained without interfering with the Reckoning match"
Are we running the raid tonite?
If people are free
@Arixama @Samakain Any chance youre free to finish the raid tonight?
9:45?
Sorry in the office today! Good luck thou!
I can join you guys
absolutely not
"we could do a different raid or restart crown, @Trissin"
I'm okay with both of those options
Is there a different raid that people want to do?
for tribute sake i need scourge or lw
We could also do something like heroic menagerie
I would be fine with whatever
I'm gonna hop in the voice channel
Well I think we're pretty much ready to go @RonInDune @Jump
Alright logging in
@PC one more for crown of sorrow? no exp required!
If you guys give me a few minutes I can log on
Just finishing up some chores
"yeah, ofc"
take ur time!
I thought we said 9:45?
Do u still need one?
We can do another one at 9:45
Just tell me when y’all are done with ur run
are y'all done?
Last encounter
okie
@Jump
do you want to join us?
uh sure
Got masterwork on ||bad juju||
"@PC Hey everyone, so I've been thinking about this for a while, but I'd like to organize a friendly clan-wide event consisting of private PvP / gambit. I talked about this a little bit with the group that I was raiding with yesterday, and it seems there would be interest in something of this nature. 

I made this survey to fill out, and we'll see if people's schedules line up, and if there's enough interest to make it happen!
*Even if you have never said a word to anyone here before, I encourage people to attend and meet others in the clan!

https://forms.gle/erQadnPnrcBi7LsY7"
LOL @Trissin  that survey was solid XD
I kind of half expected the PvP skill question to have an option for just me lmao.
"I mean, there was basically a response just for you lool"
"*""RELAX GUARDIAN, YOU'RE SCARING THEM! THEY'LL NEVER WANT TO MATCH WITH YOU AGAIN!""*"
Still chasing one of those
XDXD
"Nah oath, we're gunna do a six v three with you, Matos and buttkicker on a team"
"@Trissin filled out your form, but i'm expecting my schedule to change soon, so i might be able to play outside of listed hours. just let me know what's best for everyone else"
if we don't get enough people we could always just rock a 4 stack in comp. how many have filled out the form so far?
"actually it's only been a couple hours, silly question"
Lol all good.
I just finished the jade rabbit catalyst!
damn i would've joined you
I gotta get around to doing a bunch of quests and triumphs. Haven't been on in about a week.
i was just about to ask what you were doing trissin
i need to do mine too
"yeah, haven't seen you on in a while @Matos !"
Plenty of stuff to do lol
I'm still down to play pvp tan
hell yeah i'm in a mood let's go
lol i can join in that case
i have to get the lumina handcannon kills
i haven't played in like a week or so either tho
yeah i need to do a bunch of lumina stuff
quickplay warmup yeet
i also have been cheesing wendigo
taking a while thou
Got my catalyst this morning. Just gotta grind it out now
ok so u wanna rock crucible in a bit @Pentan @Trissin
maybe like 10 minutes?
we're going right now
hop in whenever
it's a long one @Arixama
For ||bad juju||
Ok I’m coming
oooh congrats @Arixama
https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz0xUfEjpP0/?igshid=88424dsxdc98
Hey guys! Y’all wanna run a raid tonite?
Maybe last wish or scourge?
Yeah I'm down for either/both
yeah i was just talking to trissin about how i need to do last wish again. i have my glittering key
"don't worry @Jump, we won't make you do plates puzzle lol"
"i do have outbreak for raiding now, but i don't have the masterwork."
i can run outbreak or tractor cannon as per ususal
"All good, the masterwork isn't necessary I think
Tractor is good, but we'll see what's needed and what we have"
"@Jump is currently missing a lot of good weapons and exotics, for now I would say try to focus on getting Wendigo and Sleeper Simulant"
i still don't have wendigo
"Don't worry, it's not essential"
I’m just grinding all the pinnacle and exotic quests
It’s really long winded I’m going as fast as I can
But I’m also just doing what I want cuz grinding all day will make me hate destiny again
Also @Pentan I actually want to do the plates lol
I want to learn XD
Especially the vault
Everything else I’m good on
2 tributes away from the emote!
Last wish and scourge tributes?
thats all i need
and im like 70% of lw
Niiiice
Let's get that tonight!
How bout 9:30?
Hmm spider's selling glimmer/data/phaseglass for shards
Might be a good time to buy stuff
Oooooooh
Glimmer pls
:)))))
Definitely a good time to buy glimmer
i did spider bounties for glimmer
Ty Ron!!
I'm so sad
I just choked the easiest 7th column of my life
Nooooooo rip
...................the game even said I got a 7 multi-kill
Oh nooo
It was so free too
I had three people around me
its ok it happens every once in a while]
My super ended and then I died
i remember my moba days
7th columns do not happen nearly as often as pentakills.
in fact mobas hit harder
"Spawns have to be in your favor, you need to be in the right place with the right weapon and the right method of getting all 7 kills."
when ur 10k gold up at 15 and then the game goes to a 100 minute game for u to lose
tru tru
alright im logging on now
"last wish, yes? or scourge?"
im fine with either
Scourge would be preferred for me
Want a shot at Anarchy
"cool, okay"
I'm just gonna head to tower real quick
ill be on shortly
Anyone for scourge?
i'm for last wish
"Eh Scourge doesn't take longer than an hour usually, we can do last wish after"
Unless something goes terribly wrong
"^
Scourge should be pretty quick, I don't mind doing last wish afterwards"
Want to join us in voice @RonInDune ?
So Drewsky just said there's a crucible cheese with the *tarrabah* where you can self inflict damage so you can instantly get the perk active
I think I'm going to try it out
lol go for it
they added spectator mode to comp and matos signed up for the beta
mid match as a matter of fact
!!!!!!
"Ah yes, that bug"
"we're playing some comp @Buttkikker , want to join us?"
Matos' mystical gambit powers have crossed over
not atm doing bergusia for the 500 threat level kills
ohh i see
Yeah that one took me way too long
gettingg aprox 25-30 kills per forge
so not too bad
Yeah I kept killing yself by getting too close
ah yeah
ive got the heal nade so im usualy fine
join us @Buttkikker !
ill get to 250 and then join
@Oathbreaker Hey! D2 pvp is stupid.
We keep getting that bug where we don't respawn.
In comp.
"Go to pursuits and see if you can complete a bounty, otherwise try swapping weapons"
I think that's the temporary fix
Did they fix Lord of wolves?
It's not doing much for me.
You’re joking right?
I had to sit out the entire last game except the first round and right before I spawn in on the next game my power goes out
Idk what they broke but that's the current situation
"And no, Lord of Bullshit still exists"
Do we have enough poeple to run last wish today?
Or heroic menagerie
im so down for either
"yeah, let's do last wish"
Go get your tributes boiz
tributes?
For the tribute hall. The ones that cost planetary materials
tribute hall?
The stuff that dropped this week.
apparently there's some stuff i need to catch up on. i haven't been paying that much attention
I sadly resorted to cheating and kept the game open on 100 power in the forges and woke up with enough planetary mats to buy all the tributes
wait 100 power?
how does this mat farm work?
That's not cheating.
You go on at a low power and the Forge ends before you get kicked for being afk
"Yeah so go in with as low power as you can, I used my starting damaged traveler's chosen gear"
You get matched with other powple also AFK farming so noone gets hurt
what makes it end quickly?
Only works for dusklight and data lattice
The timer on the Forge is only a minute
"And nobody is doing anything, so it finishes in 1:10, puts you into matchmaking again which resets the timer."
"My game kept disconnecting so I tried it last night, didn't work 😦"
wait no
how do i make it show up again
thank you warmind
you asked for it :BAguns:
I think warmind is turning into Rasputin
@RonInDune @Buttkikker @Arixama @Trissin are we go? i'm in raid chat
I'll need like 20 more minutes sorry
in a mayhem match with 2 shadows
also managed to get 2 precision kills without dying?
ping me when youre starting
it would go faster if you come help us get matos to run with us
I'm loggin in now
is matos not joining us?
apparently not
he's being a really lame gamer
actually i'm revoking his gamer status
Are we missing one?
yes we need one more
I'll bring LittlePants with us
aight
well in that case we're just waiting on ron and you two
Ahh rip are y’all running last wish?
if bungo lets us
Lol rip
If y’all need another or if u want to do something after HMU
Hey anyone down for a 100K nightfall run?
For the tribute hall
give me one sec
i can join
im on queenswalk rn
how long is it gonna take @Jump
Make sure you have everything calus themed just to be sure you get it
ty @Arixama
i'm ready to go @RonInDune
Acrius counts right @Arixama ?
ty ty
"Acrius, bad juju and Tarabah for calus exotics"
im ready
if y'all want
join up on us
Anybody want to do a sotp tonight?
@Trissin up for a scourge tonight?
I’m down but for later
"maybe @Arixama , dont have an answer for you just yet"
"sorry, I don't think i'll be joining for scourge tonight"
@max? @Jump  have you run scourge before?
phase has he helped clear adds on map mostly however
Huh someone solo-d Riven
i thought gladd did that during revelry
i guess without those buffs?
that's pretty intense
Yeah did it today it seems
Never heard of this streamer before though
||https://twitter.com/Baxlyy/status/1150568506892550144||
@Oathbreaker  how is this for crucible?
(range masterwork hammer forged riffling)
"One of the best rolls you can get, hands down."
"Rangefinder is more consistent than opening shot but OS doesn't give extra zoom, outlaw is always nice and the range trifecta is great."
I personally think opening shot is  better tbh
As long as you can consistently hit the precision shot
nah i'd much rather have rangefinder
I guess its a oreference thing
i dont like the extra zoom either
Rangefinder adds maybe 1-2m of additional range. OS matches that and gives extra AA on first shot.
I have Eye of the Storm and OS and it's just dumb the AA I have.
Hey @Oathbreaker do you know a better handcannon that has a similar recoil and firepattern to the IKELOS handcannon?
AA?
"Aim Assistance. Really, on PC with M&K it's bullet magnetism"
True term lmao
It works
"As for the hand cannon, not many 180s left that are ""good"""
"Two immediately come to mind, one is not a big pain but the other is."
Service Revolver and Trust
OOF i dont like trust
It doesnt feel as tight as IKELOS
i just really like the recoil on IKELOS
Trust is mediocre but easily farmed from Menagarie. Service Revolver is currently unobtainable due to it being a Season 6 triumph but Bungie are working on it from what I understand.
No problem.
"Three months ago I would have said Luna's lol but seeing as though it got nuked into oblivion, there's now like 3 180s that are decent"
Yea luna's feels really tight too
i liked it
but BIG rip
They butchered the Magnificent Howl guns.
Yea
"Absolutely destroyed any use with them, barring the range of Not Forgotten but even then, I'd rather have other less difficult to obtain options."
Tru
you know Bungie should just introduce the pistol from halo
so OP would solve all the problems
optional scope like no recoil
2 shots hunters
ez pz
The 150rpm archetype is the closest match.
No hand cannon will 2-tap standalone
Rampage Duke will
I believe in halo's  handcannon
#IDontKeepItLoadedSon
and when i meant hunters i meant covenant hunters XDXD
bitch it one shot hunters
i remember tht
the first time i saw that i was like why?
Bullet would ricochet off their armor
That and the sniper would do massive damage because of their bullets ricocheting off the hunter armor as intended but on the inside (where it was not intended to ricochet)
i miss HALO
juju catalyst almost doubles the length of string of curses
Did you get the weird firefly explosions ari?
Haven't played with it enough yet
According to reddit you get it between 40 and 150 kill intervals
anybody wanna play some crucible?
"either way, i'll be in voice chat in a few minutes. just hop in and i'll get you in after i finish whatever match i'm playing"
"just now noticed it says published by bungie. idk how long it's been like that, but it feels good to see"
@Pentan  how long are u going to be playing for?
I'd be down to join u later
for the foreseeable future
But i have to do some work rn and still have to eat dinner
Can u do around 10ish?
Maybe a tad bit later
i'm actually gonna do a couple menagerie runs and try to get a better austringer until someone else joins or i run out of runes
I have to do that too
my austringer has a garbage roll
And i also have to get all the opulent gear still 😦
yeah i haven't gotten any opulent gear. not really worried about it
Its just for the triumphs Im really behind on them?
When does the tribute hall thing end?
i'm not the person to ask
i assumed the tribute hall is here to stay though
somebody please tell me if i'm wrong
"Yeah Tribute Hall is forever, moments of triumph is temporary"
"||ALso, apparently a couple of D1 exotics are coming back in shadowkeep||"
||Monte Carlo||
||Time and Patience||
(Sorry @Trissin !)
|| and Dragon’s Breath||
So wats the difference sorry I’m hella confused now
@Pentan I’m almost done if u r still down to go
Hey @Oathbreaker how many comp points do you get at weekly reset?
i'm running in a 4 stack with trissin rn @Jump
Depends on rank
Sorry jump we stole him

Below Fabled it's like 120-130
Above Fabled it's like 80 or so
"okay, ty"

Golden Empire

The default imperial opulence isn't that bad....
"Most of mine that are left are heroic menagerie, one CoS challenge, and slot runes"
i have to disagree im sorry
Did you guys see the ||spooky floating shadows in the Shadowkeep trailer? They look like the creatures from Death Stranding!||
"Also, congrats @Trissin !!!!"
Getting a lot of bread today lol
aha ty ron!
Yeah I’m just laying in bed now. I’ll probably be back on later
Yea take it easy @Pentan
Apparently you can one phase/cheese Riven with Tarrabah
Shall we test that?
Do we have 6 people with Tarrabah?
"you and I make 2, yes?"
Yeah for now

Thanks @Trissin for arranging an excellent clan event!

Yea I can get it quickly and then we can hunt the eggs down
We can also run last wish later
I'm down for last wish but I might need some help I've never done it before
That’s fine
There are many people on this server that can help u
I’m not a pro by any means but I could run u through the basic mechanics of the raid as well 😃
Ill run lw
Anyone interested in comp?
"Found this in a wonderful Twitch chat:

""I'd like to pitch a TV series. It's about the victims who have been affected by LoW, their stories, and justice being done to those who would use the weapon. Call it LoW & Order: SVU."""
Booo!

Man ||Armour 2.0 is going to be really complicated lol||
how so?
That's a lot of stats
OH I GET IT
"||each mod is going to have a point value similar to scrabble, and then youll have so many points to spend (which looks like it can be upgrades up to 10)||"
||ooooh nice observation!!!||
||looks like the point value is determined by mod rarity/power||
"||greens are 1, blues are 2, purps are 3, but there are also 5 purps||"
Dang Ari well spotted!
"||i'd put money on enhancement cores being used to upgrade the energy bar for the armor, since there doesnt seem to be a masterwork slot and the energy bar appears to go up to 10. i wonder if chests will have more energy because they currently have more perks on them?||"

"||So stats seem like they'll still be random rolls, and and everything I guessed at appears to be true ||"
I’m really happy because this year my solstice of heroes Armour will actually be useful for more than 2 months!
depending on shadowkeeps armor system and if it effects the solstice armor
Wait you weren't playing during solstice last year @Jump
My friend and I played on ps4
I remember just doing homecoming
My friend got the whole set and was pissed cuz he had to throw it in the vault after random rolls completely blew everything else in the water
Does anyone wanna play comp later?
Anyone else?
We need to get that three man XD
oh I didn't know u played on ps4
Yea I did not very extensively
I played d1 a lot more
I remember doing vault of glass
Never got the dlc
Sadly I missed out on taken king
are high value targets guaranteed in prime?
I know they arent in normal gambit
or at least werent
But they pop up pretty often
I average around 1 a game
Sometimes I’ve seen 3 in a game
Do u wanna q gambit?
I have to still upgrade my synthesizer and deny an invasion of quests
im in a match rn ill let you know when its over
on primevil
im in voicechat
I’ll hop in gimme a sec
Play one more match maybe and I’ll join u
I don’t wanna keep u waiting
So I just totalled up my play time across destiny versions. I've got over 1200 hours.
Minus maybe 36 for afk farming mats overnight a couple of times.
Dang!
Anybody want an emblem of the synth?
Is that the one from buying something from the store?
"I still haven't received mine from pre ordering the Grimoire Vol 2. I raised an issue with customer service, no help yet..."
I know it was a seperate email with a link where you have to go download a pdf.
Huh I hope it didn't get swallowed by the spam filter
"From bungie store digital product, and it's a different email address"
You planning on getting a mot shirt?
Nah shipping is too high
What's the shipping?
It was something ridiculous like $16 for the book
Cheapest
Book is heavier than a shirt
Hmm I might look it up then
Shipping on my shirt was like 5
"Oh for a completely different topic, does anyone play Super Mario Maker 2 on the switch?"
im gonna get it soon and I know buttkikker has it
"Apparently someone remade the Whisper mission on in there, complete with secret paths"
||https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cex5f2/i_recreated_the_whisper_in_super_mario_maker_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app||
Can someone smile upon me and carry me in comp? 🙏🙏🙏
@Trissin want to finish our reckoning for the helmet? my reaper head bounty will expire in 14 hours
@Oathbreaker wats a good roll for the erentil
"Range, range, and more range"
I want to pair it with ace
Did I mention range
So wat perks rangefinder and?
"Not rangefinder actually, for the theoretical perfect roll"
Hold on I'll get the list lmao
We can run menagerie for it right?
Long Range Scope/Projection Fuse or Particle Repeater/Under Pressure/Tap The Trigger is what you want with Range MW
I basically have that roll with Stability MW instead
I can hit consistent 45m 1HKOs
It's dumb
And that's unbuffed
So the first one?
That’s insane
Stand in an empowering rift and I would hit 55m shots
62m is technically possible with empowering and lunafactions but then it comes down to spread
Huh I actually preferred having backup plan and snapshot sights for the quick takedowns
Also an okay roll
Wat would be the right play style for such a roll?
But backup plan has a weird activation time and fucks with your cadence on non-backup shots
"Literally play cover, look to get a pick on someone being aggressive"
The idea is to pre-charge and anticipate when someone will push
Punish accordingly
Got it 👍
Np
"Pair with Ace or Thorn, maybe Rose or if you have a good Spare Rations"
Austringer also works
I like to run ace
Is thorn really that good?
Why would u pick thorn over ace?
"With perk active, I believe it 2 taps to the head with someone not at 6 resilience"
Ace you need to keep it out to have perk active
Thorn helps with chaining kills and not losing perk
"Oh crap, sorry I just saw your message now @Matos , do you still need help with reckoning?"
"I'll be on tomorrow morning if you need, just give me a shout"
i got it done
still need comp for recluse
Looks like my only chance for getting all the moments of triumph is comp crucible rank...
im down for comp
im hunting for recluse as well
Same here
Man the gambit prime armor for hunters is just...real ugly.
Are all these pouches for my shame?
i actually dont like the look of the gambit armour for the most part
not appealing
Anyone wanna run comp in about an hour or so?
Holy shit iron banner is back next week isn't it
@Buttkikker I’ll join u shortly
i did the math and about 0.54% of the US population has signed up on facebook to say they're going to area 51
who wants to help me with the wishender bow?
i gotta pick it up from the shattered throne
Trying solo flawless shattered throne and my mouse died right as I got to vorgeth
jsut about had a heart atttack
im so sorry for ur loss
anyone wanna run a raid?
"like CoS, SotP, or LW"
how do i create an event?
What time you looking at?
either now or later in the night
I'm down later tonight
That look good @Jump ?
hmm im thinking crown?
instead of SotP?
but if more people wanna do that im ok aswell
I just picked one since you listed all 3.
!LFG edit
!LFG edit 308
All set
"For future reference, anybody wanting to set up a raid LFG, the command is ""!LFG create"" and then you just follow the instructions from warmind to set it up!"
we still doing crown?
I think so? I'm ready whenever
@Jump @Arixama  are you guys ready
welp I just loaded into gambit
"That's fine we still need jump, right?"
Are we all ready?
go ahead on join up on me and go to the raid voicechat
i cant join
:BAyeet:
Good luck team !
Trissin pls lend us your anarchy
Uh oh
Lol i would if it were possible :(
without anarchy I might recommend swords and tractor
oh tractor wold help alot
we just had swords
Yeah don't forget that tractor lol
And I realized I can't melting point with a  sword on
U guys got this!
were taking a break for now
jump had to go for a bit so were taking a break
ohhh I see
how's the raid been going so far??
It’s a bit rough
But we r getting through
"would have loved to join, but I'm visiting some folks down in toronto"
I think you guys got this
I’d rather eat dinner now and then take the time properly to complete the raid
Did y’all find a sixth to complete it?
They convinced me to play gambit somehow
OOOO
Gambit
I’ll join in like 15 ish
"When Iron Banner comes around, could someone help me by using hand cannons with me? Hand cannon crucible kills are needed for both thorn and rose"
I’m ready
are u ready @RonInDune
tell me when y'all are back
Yeah I'm free too
@Trissin  buttkikker topped your rally flag height
Icing on the cake is thats the run we got it too
we won that run too
it was great
truly glorious
:BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet:
"If you guys are done, could I get assistance with just one Reckoning? I only have enough for one last chance tonight"
I FINALLY GOT MY GOD ROLL
noice
I haven't even gotten one with snapshot yet
dude its everything i wanted
and I farmed a LOT
chambered accurized snapshot and quickdraw
now i have to farm erentil
and i need someone to do shattered throne with me today
for the triumph
anyone interested in comp?
@here?
I'd be interested in a Shattered Throne run later tonight for some lore
Also need to do Corrupted for Pulse Rifle
Yes please
I need to get wish ended and complete it once for the triumph @Oathbreaker
Wishender
Okay. I'll be busy for maybe an hour or so starting in half an hour but should be back later
@Oathbreaker @Jump i also need shattered throne for lore and eggs
How bout in like an hour?
I’m gonna cook dinner soon
GOT MY 20 KILL STREAK
37 kills/assits and 3 deaths
12.33 efficiency
killstreak was like 24 i think
but yeah sure like 8:30 is good for me
jade rabbit is actually nuts
!last pvp
"just checked, looks like the spree was 25"
i also just got getaway artist! i have all the warlock exotics now
good day for me
"Gonna be a few minutes from now, I'm in for it still"
Apologies for being later than expected guys!
@Pentan GETS IT
JADE RABBIT :1_:
On long range maps
Jade is legit
If I could name any gun as a sleeper gun in PvP it would be Jade
how are you gonna call jade a sleeper when cerberus+1 exists
"rat king, sweet business"
Because those are niche
Jade on long range maps its legit
and jade is better than niche
also when I say sleeper I mean that it's secretly really good so don't boo me lmao
"i'll take ""only long range"" over niche any day"
oh my bad
The issue with midrange is it just gets out-dueled by most things assuming someone can aim
Short range... I don't think I have to go over this one. I hope.
i have also been sleeping on crimson
gonna start running that i think
NO SWORDS
GTFO
There is a very clear split in the clan
Sword users
and sword haters
:BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet: :BAyeet:
*Several people are typing...*
"Swords rule, guns drool"
I can think of 3 swords I like using
Of them
1 is in D2
"destiny 12? damn oath, what time are you from?"
Razelighter?
I AM TIRED
Okay technically 2 are in D2
Black Talon for pocket Dawnblade
Razelighter because fuck everything standing right in front of me
And Dark-Drinker because spin to win
what the heck oath you forgot steel sybil
"oath is from a time where fun is outlawed, and pvp is required for life"
Its just so good
You guys haven't lived till you've won the Quickplay World Championships okay
the QWC is all that matters
Seriously though
literally. they kill you if you lose.
Oh no I can imagine a Destiny Battle Royale
I wouldn't touch it
lets go
"More like ""bad""tle royale"
its the shiva that are the boundaries
What can possibly go wrong
gottem
I mean the idea is there
Like let me clarify
The idea would be cool
the winner becomess an iron lord
Siva as the storm
That would be more of a Shadows of Yor type thing
Iron Lords are kinda almost extinct lmao
exactly
lord saladin is recruiting
"All abilities available, maybe Ana Bray's pools of light scattered around"
i dunno about ALL abilities
"as far as im concerned, my warlock is already an iron lord"
thats kinda toxic
@Oathbreaker @Pentan shattered trhone?
throne?
Hmm maybe abilities from right after the battle of twilight gap
yes i'm ready
yeet
"See, my issue with a Destiny Battle Royale is that the game is full of bullshit, there will be a lot of cases of THIS NEEDS TO BE NERFED etc. till suddenly dancing is the only way to kill someone"
DUDE
DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION destiny edition
Destiny: Dancing on Light
I don't even know where to start with that
discord is breaking down
fir mne
for me*
Anyone up for Crucible or Crown tonight?
lmaoooo finally didn't die to the jumping puzzle this time
Oooh nice
Going for flawless?
here we go
Good luck!!
oh sorry the image is just taking a while to upload
Hot damn
COngrats!!!!
haha ty
Literally the hardest PvE activity in Destiny hands down
I just can't get past vorgeth
Die there every time
"Yeah, Vorgeth is pretty rough"
"I always try to one-phase him, but am unable to"
we were literaelly in shattered throne XD
nice job
ty ty :))
"but like seriously
never again LMAO"
congrats trissin
"@Jump @Oathbreaker again, sorry for stepping out on you earlier. had some friends waiting on me and i really didn't think it would be as long as it was. hope you guys could finish it off without too much trouble"
"We were able to finish it fairly quickly, no worries man!"
Shattered Throne can be deceptively long when working on everything lol
"If anyone still needs osprey for wayfarer, strange terrain is up"
whats a god roll for swarm of the raven @Trissin ?
give me a moment
Spike grenades & field prep
PvE yeah?
rest is not too important
I'm tired as hell so that may be a dumb question but I'm asking it anyways
Quick Launch or Hard Launch/Spike Grenades/Field Prep/Quickdraw would probably be the theoretical best roll
"With a range mw, yeah?"
Velocity
From memory the higher the velocity the better
massive f for the other team
wat about the barrel n stuff?
That's the launch
Quick launch/hard launch
so wats the full roll?
Posted above jump
"spike grenades, field prep, and"
Quick Launch or Hard Launch/Spike Grenades/Field Prep/Quickdraw
With velocity MW
The other perks don't really do much
Maybe Ambitious Assassin but Swarm is meant for straight boss DPS so no add clear stuff
is shining sphere good?
I don't even know what that is
i just got 2 mmercies in a row
its a rocket launcher
i though iron banner was hard XD
Put yourself at low light and it'll be harder
thats tru
Iron Burden
"Huh turns out Bungie's clearing house today. I have a couple of Emblem of Synth emblems remaining, anyone want one?"
but isnt the point that everyone is at 750 by now?
emblem of synth?
Hey I'll take one if you got some extras
I still have some iron burdens now
i mean if its free ill take one
wat r iron burdens?
Iron Burdens get turned into tokens if used
**emblems!!** Lol
an old debuff that lowered your light by 100
From last season.
oh shit
wait is it not a thing anymore
"If you're doing IB, can I join you in a minute?"
????? Why did they get rid of it
They only did it for the one season
go ask Bungie Trissin
huh...
Seriously though no one knows really why
Here @Oathbreaker 4NR-PM9-LMA
i should wait before claiming the armor for upping my chance with swarm right?
I'd recommend that
r they gonna have one more iron banner before the season endds/
"Because people complained about it being tied to a weapon, so bungie got stopped using it"
@RonInDune Thanks man!
wats was the thing ron was giving out?
"Jump, go ahead and claim the armor, but turn your tokens in on a different character"
It only unlocks the armor on the character doing the quest.
Ron is offering emblems lol
ohhhhhhh
what emblems?
Emblem of the synth
You get it from buying stuff on Bungie store this season
Yeah I got one each from buying two title/seal medallions and one from the Grimoire Vol. 2
oh cool!
are they like in game cosmetics?
"Okay, for Hunter IB, recommended loadout/ exotics? I'd like at least one sniper"
beloved ace
or last word
YESSS
I GOT RED DWARF!!!
Oh I liked that show
Kinda weird humour but still
i meant the ornament for sunshot XDXD
ive never heard of that show
imma look it up
It's a david Zucker-ish satire on Star Trek. Very British humour.
"sorry to everyone that paid $10 for that emote, but you can buy Consulting the Archives™ with bright dust right now"
yeah but you dont get the discount for the book
right
well no but you also don't have to pay $10
"Meh, it's a good emote and I'd rather bungie know I want them to keep making grimoire books."
anyone for t3 reckoning its blackout knights but its the 2nd to last thing i need for reckoner just need 2 more successful runs
reckoner
yeah ill help out
"So it seems like one of the requirements for masterworking solstice gear is a ||200,000 nightfall||"
how do i get solstice gear?
Step one is wait for solstice to start
there
Congrats!!!!!
Oh wow congratulations!!!!
That's amazing
The real question is how many enhancement cores did you gain from it?
congrats man!
lol i randomly just got borealis
Nice it's a pretty good one
"another week, another couple sad retold tale rolls"
what happens if i have an ornament on weapon and i dismantle the weapon?
does the ornament go away permanently
Ornaments are permanently unlocked
nah it'll still be there if you pull weapon from collections
ornaments work the way shaders should work
oh so i dont have to reaquire the ornament seperately?
Nope!
The only thing you lose is your kill streak counter if it's masterworked
oh so once i get an ornament i should just equip it immediately
theres no point in holding onto it
Nah shaders are fine now with the way collections work
"are they much improved? yes. do they still leave plenty to be desired? yes. am i gonna complain until i don't have to go dig through collections, find the shader, spend legendary shards, and then find the shader again to equip it? yes."
"Do they need better organization in collections? Yes. If legendary shards were any sort of scarce resource then it'd be a problem that the cost shards, but they're not. Also finding the shader to equip is a non issue after you have it, especially in the scenario you presented because the shader interface armor automatically sorts by newest, so it's the first slot."
i think right now the biggest problem facing destiny isnt even the content
its the UI
its really really frustrating
too many tabs with multiple panels and a lack or organization
"The only real problem I see with the ui is the pursuits tab, and that's because there's no shortcut to get to it"
Yeah somehow Bungie made one of the best and the worst UIs in gaming
"well i still get to bitch about only having 50 inventory slots for shaders, and you can't take that away from me"
ideally i think we should just be able to equip them straight from collections
I'd like an auto dismantle for picked up shaders.
Like at this point any shader I pick up gets dismantled and then I just print the ones I want when I want them
also we're never gonna get it but auto dismantle for blues would be great
at least in d1 they had a chance to be legendary
BuT ThEy CoUlD hAvE sHaDeRS
anybody wanna run some comp?
ive been trying to find someone for like a week 😦
aight well i have until like 10:30. after that i told somebody i'd do something with them
im sorry i cant rn im leaving for vac tomorrow
and i wanna grind iron banner
garsh darnit
but im down later
me like all of last week XD
"Whoa, lots of people online. Anybody want to run a raid or something?"
Haven't been to do one in a while
there's a 7 person limit in each channel?
"sorry, they dragged me in here"
lol sorry that was me
u should remove the 7 person limit
especially sincec we r a clan
it a six person on the raid channel
even then
did y'all complete the raid?>
"Yep, it went very smoothly"
if anyone wants to join for ib rounds tell us
only a feww thou
@trissin @RonInDune you guys still doing raids?
currently yes
doing CoS
x marks the spot aquired
"That's where I need to shoot, right?"
How long does it take an inexperienced person to get 300 pvp sniper kills?
depends on how many bots you match with in rumble
finally perfected the Chalice
Dang congrats!!!
Now we gotta do the heroic mengaerie
First I need Izanagi's Burden. I want to get that before doing heroic
"Yeah good idea, what do you have left?"
stuck finding a rare bounty :nkoCry:
Oh noo yeah that's super annoying
Don't forget to do the augmented weapon bounties as well!
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48006
Armor looks good! The super grindy sparrow seems okay too
Yeah this is pretty god :||the Solstice of Heroes armor set the first armor 2.0 set you will receive||
you can pair the sparrow with the ship from last year
indeed
im excited to start grinding
"It starts next week, yeah?"
"||Sad to say, but the eververse water-bike sparrow might replace my main one||"
||https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/125/125743/SoH_Short_Sparrow.mp4||
Hmm I got a hard launch/spike/field prep swarm of the raven with velocity masterwork
That's pretty good
"""pretty good"""
thats almost perfect
"after tonight i won't be on for about 4-5 days, just fyi"
and if i don't come back after that it's because i died
"oh, and in the event that i do in fact die, let me save the cops some trouble"
it was my dad
||The Laser Tag Weekend emblem is sooo good||
Yeah I saw lool
I like it a lot
I'm sad I wasn't there
I'm glad they're releasing an emblem for it
What??
Oh noooo
wish I could have been there
honestly sounds like fun. almost even a clan activity
I didn't have Destiny then (and only even had a vague idea about its existence)
We could do a clan event with only laser guns
Except Oath is only allowed swords
"Swords vs pew-pew lasers, the eternal question"
Jedi vs Stormtroopers
Yes! Great idea for a game mode!

Yo I love the new wolfenstein
Is it a DLC to 2 or a full new game?
Full game. Similar to like far cry blood dragon. $30 for new areas and content but same engine
"Cool I never got around to playing 2, but 1 was amazing. Especially when you randomly ||go to the moon!||"
"I'd say definitely play through 2, especially if you've got the game pass ultimate subscription because it's on there."
"Huh I might try it out, I remember AssCreed Origins launched at the same time as Wolf 2 and took all my attention"
"I don't remember why, but when new blood first came out I watched a playthrough of it and it didn't really catch my interest, but then I picked it up for some reason and loved it."
They do a really good job of melding a good story with over the top fps gameplay
"Yo, Youngblood is Rad. I can confirm."
Pin finally came in today!
Oh woah they look great!
Very nice!
"When I get the last Mars weapon from Ana, I’ll be ordering 2 more"
Huh apparently longer shotgun barrel lengths gives a minuscle damage bonus
But it's such a *Bungie* thing
Chap ornament gives like 4 extra damage at 14m which allows for longer range 1-shots
It's why Botheration maps people while being absolutely mediocre
I'm so tired of being put in Izanami forge by myself
The other forges I can handle solo
but Izanami is the only one that I can't
just because of how it's laid out
PaY tO wIn
We can do it together as a caln later
I need izanagi's burden kills for the triumph
ohh yeah
Is anyone going to be playing IB around 10:00 CT tonight? I’ve just about had it with random groups
Apparently No Feelings with box is crazy @Oathbreaker ?
I'm very interested
Three tap if procced
But it's a scout so just about everything beats it in the sandbox
"Not a horrible pick though, right situation it's downright scary"
Are there any legnedary scouts that are as stable as MIDA?
"I like the raid scout, but it feels like it has way less impact"
Yeah but it's a 180 rpm
That can 3 tap
0.67 ttk
Right?
got redrix finally
That's probably the longest grind in the game!
definitely up there
just glad to have the collection for crucible done mostly
"has anyone here tried flawless Crown yet? if so, know which strategy might be best/worked for you?"
Did Flawless crown the other night. Took us 2 tries. We did GLs at final boss with a Well right underneath him
"And yeah Trissin, those values sound right"
team composition?
"I think it was 1 Titan, 2 Hunters, and 3 Warlocks"
"Titan for melting point, Hunters were just kinda there, Warlocks for well"
cool👍
"I think team composition isn't actually very important, you just need minimum 3 warlocks"
"And yeah, definitely grenade launchers for damage. (+ 1 tractor)"
Just fyi to whom it may concern im going to be gone for about a week
but after that way to much solstice for my own well being
Let us know if you need any help with the solstice gear!
will do
Grinding activities are always better in a group
"Oh my god, auto rifles are SO BAD"
There's nothing worse
For the ib quest?
Cerberus is your friend
I don't think there's anything I wouldn't use over an auto rifle
Cerberus????
I've been using suros
and valakadyn
and ringing nail
"Shotgun type damage, auto rifle class"
i'll give it a go
so far it's not doing too hot
So apparently i was already at like 90% when I put cerberus on
wait how did i leave for 48 hours and suddenly cerberus is relevant
someone please explain
Iron Banner AR final blows
"I was struggling with suros, ari recommended cerberus"
turns out it didn't really matter because I only needed like 5 more
Dunno if cereberus is any good though
"Everyone I was with said Suros. Also, asking for friend, anyone know if you can still get MIDA if you skipped the main story?"
i'm sure you can
i don't see why not
You just gotta do the earth blue flag mission
*purple
There was no flag mission on the map
Have you talked to devrim?
I will advise them to do so. Anyone up for IB? I just need a 2 or more win streak so I can cheese the final quest
i just need stupid sword kills
it's actually the worst
"pshht it's not that bad, nothing's worse than AR kills"
"don't forget you can whack people with the hilt for kills too, they don't have to be powered kills"
that's even worse 😂
i used to use swords quite a bit in early d2 but i have no idea how i managed it
can't do it any more
What class you running?
warlock
Black talon
If you've got it
yeah i pulled it from collections last night planning to try it out today
thanks though
If you were running hunter I'd suggest quickfang
Cause it still is pretty good
can't believe i'm taking advice on SWORDS
what have i come to
A loot whore
@Arixama you going to be around today?
Possibly. What's up?
just looking to do stuff on D2
"I'll shoot you a message when I know for sure, but it'll be after 5 that I'll be on"
Would anyone be interested in doing the Niobe's Torment mission tonight?
what is that again?
That's the puzzle activity added in Black Armory
Beat 7 waves of enemies and do a puzzle to get an emblem and a ghost
"Oh cool, could I try?"
"Need to have a Hammerhead, Tatara Gaze, and Spiteful Fang to do it though"
"I know to bring any BA weapons I have, but that's about it"
"Yeah, the three I listed are the ones you'd need"
"One's the machine gun, the bow, and the last?"
The sniper
Sniper
"k I don't think I have the sniper hanging around, but I could forge one real quick"
"I can do sniper, I have the positions and stuff down from my last try"
You can do bow or mg
I'm fine with either
"Would be my first attempt. I can run either bow or MG, I will be swapping off of it though because screw using a bow constantly lol"
"Oath you might like the mg most then, cause you'd need great aim"
@Trissin always did mg during our attempts
Can run MG then
"Okay, I got to see Spider's goods for the Drifter's side of the storyline from last season for the first time today, and one of the items he sells that you're not supposed to get cost 5 override frequencies. Knowing you should only be able to hold one at a time, there is actually a way to make multiple of them at a time if your inventory is full and they are sent to the postmaster. Has anyone actually tried to buy the item from Spider this way, or would it break Destiny?"
"Wait, here's a really stupid thing, but would I have to do the quest that requires Izanagi's burden or is that something separate?"
No way possible Thawxtem
What do you mean?
People have tried but you can't actually do what you want to try if I remember correctly
"Yeah Thawx people tried all sorts of ways, including deleting and making new characters to get more overrides to access it."
worth a shot. oh well.
"I don't think you have to do Izanagi's, that 's part of the mysterious data pad quest"
Yeah. Was wondering just because I don't really have much of a clue for that lol
"I got Izanagi's, was more wondering for the rest of that quest"
"anyone know how to actually do the puzzle, or are we freehanding/googling it?"
This was the inforgraphic we used during our last try:
https://imgur.com/a/qQjV9zI
"Have it open separately, especially the last image so that you know the locaiton of the symbols"
We got stuck on level 7 everytime
Another article to read before starting so that you have an understanding of all the stages: https://www.metabomb.net/destiny-2/gameplay-guides/destiny-2-niobe-labs-guide-how-to-solve-puzzles-and-niobes-torment
Might not be tonight guys. Just had something come up
Alright no worries
Anyone doing stuff tonight?
Still on
I feel like there's not much to do actually :(( so I logged off
lucky :'(
I still need to do 3 comp games to keep my streak up
"After this match, I could go for comp"
"I'll need 15 more minutes, so you're good for a bit"
I need a quick 100k nightfall.
Alright I'm logging in now
stuck in about-to-launch mode
"nvm, vegetables saved the day. for once, yay beets!"
"Beet error?
https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/46903"
"ya. just restarted Destiny, just to be safe."
1st time this happened this week on IB
Well @Matos you didn't miss much there lol. The remaining matches were complete disasters.
I'll be trying to get my 100k nightfall done tonight and hopefully get that RL from strange terrain.
Hey can I join in on the gambit runs?
I would love to join as well if we are making a Gambit group
"oh crap, sorry I just saw the message!"
"I'm actually going to be logging off soon, so sorry!!"
But I'll be on tomorrow
Update can now be downloaded
Yay
lets see if i can make it to tower before the crowd
Lol good luck
Aha ty
Maybe you'll have the full masterworked Armour before I even log in!
lool i highly doubt it
it's gonna be a long grind!
omg do you have to buy silver for the glows
noooooo
noooooooooooooooooooooo
..!!!!
I think you can get them with bright dust?
Oh this is very nice!
Really want to do a heroic menagerie now
servers are down?
"nvm, my launcher was derping"
"before dismantling everything Banshee is going to give me for the legendary shards, is there anything he has that can be called 'good' if it has the right roll that I should watch out for?"
I got some good erentil rolls from Banshee
https://youtu.be/WstSE4f_WgQ
Pay to lose sparrow.
So with today's buff.... I have a really dumb idea
Solo Riven.
I have basically everything I'd need for it
"I mean, today would be the day."
"What is today’s buff? Haven’t been able to check, at work"
Arc.
It buffs your speed and melee damage.
so i'm now part of the build team for the remake of my all-time favorite minecraft mod
"the mod was thaumcraft, but the dev discontinued it like a couple years ago. a group is remaking it and calling it Arcana and i get to be a part of it"
"that's actually pretty cool, congrats!"
For once I actually know what that is. Good luck with the project!
"Thanks guys, i'm really excited to get to work on this"
OK but which thaumcraft we talking
https://twitter.com/deej_bng/status/1156974754907033600?s=21
Ooh I like the name of the new raid: ||Garden of Salvation||
I'm excited for cross save and having a few more weeks to do solstice stuff
@Arixama wym which thaumcraft
We talking thaumcraft 3? 4?
Like which iteration are you basing off of?
"well 5 was the last official release, and 6 was in beta when development stopped"
they're basing it primarily off of 4 it seems but taking influence from all the versions
"4 had the hex puzzle, right?"
"yup, but that's not how they're doing research"
@Trissin as long as it's nothing like ||Pleasure Gardens|| i'm ok
it was a nightmare year 1
"Man, getting 100 miniboss kills takes a while, I wish it was as a fireteam."
I agree
Looks like emblems are out!!
"Also yeah, 100 miniboss kills is super annoying"
Apparently there is a way to cheeses the miniboss kills.  If you get the cabal version of EAZ you can kill 2 out 3 bosses. Every 45 seconds an engineer will spawn. Everyone can get progress for it if they all land a shot on the engineer.
Oh is that so
But that's like 1 every 45 seconds.. I feel like it'd be faster to just run the EAZ
"Maybe, I haven't tried it yet"
"Whoa, it looks like theyre making mountaintop and wendigo easier to get?!?!?"
and I JUST
DID
MOUNTAINTOP
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
"^^^
I feel you oath"
On the other hand
RECKONING DROP RATE INCREASE
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
looooooool
Menagerie chests will become more rewarding? 😮
"If anybody want to try out the cheese or just run EAZ in general, let me know"
I'd love to run EAZ but my blizzard client is being fussy
"I logged out of destiny for a second, and apparently there's an update I need to download, and now it's stuck on initializing"
"That sucks, sorry to hear that."
"lol no need to be sorry, ill give you a heads up if I get it working again"
I can run some for sure
If we do end up trying the cheese we probably want a third. We can just do some normal runs until then though.
Alright. I'm just finish my current one first
Just pop me an invite whenever you are ready.
Im down to do it if you dont have 3
"Ok, we would be glad to have you."
@Trissin I'm stuck on initializaing too!
guess back to the new fortnite season
this is actually so annoying
i gave up and went to go play smash instead lol
You play smash?!
I am probably going to get a switch and smash when I get my next paycheck.
Yes!!
I love smash
And also hero came out a couple days ago
"Yeah, I was playing with my brother yesterday. Hero seems pretty good."
I know buttkikker also plays some smash.
We should add each other on switch
"Yeah, and maybe create a smash text channel on the server."
My code is SW-3402-1268-5037
Anyone else here with a switch should feel free to add me!
I will definitely have to practice. I have played maybe 10 hours of smash. I will probably have to ask for your code again when I get my switch.
Course!
bro I love smash me and nakriin play all the time
well recently we've been playing alot
im gonna friend you so we can play sometime
yessss 👍👍
also my destiny fixed itself!
mine still is initializaing
How are they linking the current destiny 2 account to steam to transfer data?
Don't know yet
ahead of schedule!
"Dang Ari, congrats!"
don't know what that is but it looks impressive so congrats
Anybody want to run last wish later tonight?
@Matos does
"I haven't logged into destiny since before reset, so I have a lot of catching up to do"
oooh yea there's a lot going on right now
solstice of heroes!
Yeah I'm going to go hard this weekend on finishing up atleast one set
@Arixama not a bad roll
What's the mw?
I think that's range
yea range
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cl6z99/ive_completed_all_3_majestic_armour_with_mw_sets/?ref=share&ref_source=link
rumble is interesting...
Im finally back and ready to grind!!!!
Let's go!! Glad youre back
It's certainly a grind
i got to start a couple days ago for a few hours before leaving again to i have some progress
but yeah its alot
let us know if you need a hand with anything!
btw when does solstice end
August 27 last I heard
@Trissin What are you and Matos doing?
We were just doing some solstice stuff
Taking a short break atm but we'll be back at it later
"I'd like to do a raid tonight, I wonder if there's enough interest in that"
"It's been pretty quiet lately, not a lot of people online"
uggg i waaana raid but solstice
conflicted feelings
Lool understandable
"Unfortunately I don't think I'll be playing much destiny this weekend, I missed my flight and things are a bit hectic"
"Good luck, and I hope you guys get enough people for the raid!"
I'd be up for a raid tonight.
Oh no! Hope things work out smoothly @RonInDune !
So do we have enough interest in a raid tonight?
@Trissin you're wrong
"Just got home lol, if you're wanting to do another one afterwards and have a spot open let me know!"
@RonInDune Are you maining Titan in Shadow keep? I heard crazy rumors.
*maining
What time were you guys looking to raid/ do you still need more people?
Anybody for Heroic Mengarie?
"Ah, we just did some last wish yesterday night @Thawxtem"
"Also absolutely, would love to do heroic menagerie @Samakain"
Just checked this now sorry @Trissin  Let me know if you wanna throw a group together if not now then later!
"Course, will do!"
Finally got my Switch!
Alright!!!
"I usually play through the story for the first time on my warlock, @Matos"
Also guys is there anything that I can only get this week? I don't think I'll be playing much if at all
nothing specific for this week
just solstice and moments of triumph but those are going for some time
"Ah perfect, thanks"
I didn't realise I was supposed to dislike Soltice until I checked the subreddit. Thankfully I have been informed that everything is in fact awful and my enjoyment is flawed. Lucky break there.
"my team had 2 afk, other team had 1 afk"
ran out of time but still won 2v3
yeah gambits a bit of a mess with the afks
What's going on? Why are people idling?
Solstice requires some gambit matches completed
id guess because they dont want to do gambit but need progress
Solstic gear requires Gambit match completion
Performance is irrelevant
Ahhh
really sucks
"I mean, it's kind of annoying
But going AFK for this is just like.. why"
Especially in a team mode
This is like the 3rd time
I've reported more people this week then I have in the last two months.
Holy crap the EAZ looks so cool
I hope it stays around after the event
sadly I don't think it will 😦
Friendly reminder it is curse week!
Make sure to get in your solo or duo shattered throne this week
"Hope everyone else is having a better day than myself, because I had a dog pee on me at work 🙃"
"@RonInDune too many functions of the EAZ are directly tied to/dependent on the SoH, such as the prizes, floating crystals that drop elemental orbs and the Taken that appear during the final boss fight."
Oh no @Oathbreaker! Assert dominance by doing the same!
Oh yeah @Thawxtem that does make sense now that I think about it. It's a shame
"Okay, it's a Rumble match and there are literally only two of us who aren't bots. When I realize this, I stop attacking the other guy and just go for easy snipes. He apparently never got the picture and constantly went after me even though I wasn't shooting at him and was just running. He was in the lead anyway, what benefit does he have of chasing me?"
Man that's unfortunate
how many slots are left in the clan? i've got some people from my old clan that are getting back into the game and want in
Plenty of space! Lol
As long as they are xhill
*chill
Feel free to invite them
"yes chill can be confirmed, thank"
@Trissin can i have an invite code for the discord?
of course
"i just sent a request to join the clan i'm already in, didn't know you could do that"
lol what
me neither
"alright well i just sent him the info but he's not normally online until the afternoon so we'll see when he joins. idk what his battle.net is, it's been a while since i've played with him, but his discord is Chance"
"I found a map of the EAZ chests on reddit, for reference: https://imgur.com/a/0Yw9Sce"
all three armor sets majestic
Nicely done
Congrats!!
Pick up that sparrow?
"Can get 3 volunteers for like an hour of your time? Prior warning, this is Crucible oriented"
It does involve private matches so not anything involving QP or Comp
"I was out earlier, but do you still need people @Oathbreaker ?"
Not really. Wanted to test a concept for an event I'm running on Friday but I'll be gaming with a bud of mine soon. Idk if I'll have time to tonight
"Ah, okay"
Well let me know if u need a hand!
"Not quite as fast as Matos, but just finished my 3 sets and got the sparrow!"
Damn you guys can grind!
"I started yesterday and I still haven't finished even one, I'm getting burned out lol"
I'm close to my third as well
"Protip to anyone who hasn't started, or is still on greens: stockpile bounties."
I'm just at the end of my second and I cannot see myself doing a third.  I have died and my corpse is a EDZ patrol marker.
What character you have left?
@Trissin you around today for that concept testing?
Yeah!
Okay. Car is currently in the shop and idk how long I'll be but I'll message you when I'm home. We'll need two other bodies as well
"Okay, np"
"Just let me know, I'll hop on"
@Trissin Available in about an hour and a bit?
"I should be, yeah"
"Not sure exactly what we're doing, but do you have enough people?"
"currently, no lol"
Now that I'm thinking about it it might be okay
So no worries if you can't or whatever
"Aha no worries im still down to help out however I can, just kind of curious what we're up to"
I can explain it to sate your curiosity hahaha
"It's like a custom game, yeah?"
Did you go with specific loadout? Or something different?
Something different
"Oh nice the steam migration is on October 1st, and we can sign up for it from August 20th"
Apparently it's so easy even a Titan can do it
@Trissin @Matos theyre reducing the miniboss amount and making the bosses count as 5
i saw
"@Arixama Just titan, and with those changes I guess i'll give it go."
Titan is pretty easy honestly. The io patrols are probably the easiest of the three planets in my opinion
"That would be true, but...then you're on Io. And Io is made of butts."
Anybody want to run a raid or something?
"I'm thinking crown, but whatever works"
Sure yeah I'm down for all
I'm getting off in 20 minutes 😦
aw 😦
I can tomorrow night though
"oh okay, maybe then"
It seems like everyone is busy working on their solstice armor
not much other activity lol
we might have a group @RonInDune
Oh nice i'll log in give me a sec
"so it looks like we've got 7 in total, but you are free to take my spot ron"
Ah no then it's fine
I have work to do lol I'd just do the raid and quit
I'll join in tomorrow!
"oh, are you sure??"
Yup yup it's all good
Have fun!!
"thanks ron, we'll have you for our next raid"
"maybe tomorrow, we'll see"
"@Oathbreaker the weekly comp bonus is 160 if you didn't leave any games, right?"
Up to but not including Fabled
Past Fabled it drops
To 80 up until Mythic and like 40 up to Legend?
Bonus is 120
Not 160
"So if I'm on 1278, can I still get it purely through the bonus this season?"
"If the season starts October 1st or whenever Shadowkeep actually launchers, possibly? Let me work out the math on that"
damn i'm so close to recluse
i thought it was 160 which would give it to me
won 12 games in comp in a row but lost my last one
"Damn @Matos, you're really good"
I played 6 games over the last couple of weeks and lost 5
Really gets me down that lol
@RonInDune If you win 2/3 of your games for the next 5 weeks you will get Fabled assuming no win streaks.
"Oh woah, thanks @Oathbreaker !!!"
"Considering my usual records that seems completely impossible, so oh well"
Anything less than a 50% W/R will not get you to Fabled
Makes sense
50% takes 300 something games with your Glory landing *exactly* on 2100
Dang this is one of the best pieces of lore in the game: ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/ghost-fragment-fallen-4#harbingers||
"I wish more of the Destiny 1 lore stuff was easily available, but I guess that's what they're doing with the Grimoires"
"Also, this makes the Harbinger's Seclude in the dreaming city so much more eerie"
Sparrow aquired
😴😴😴😴😴
Nice!! Congrats!!!
finally
Brilliant!
Welcome to the gang
😿 😢 😿
Man Unbroken players are way too good
This dude complete destroyed us
"That guy is in Primal, one of the leading PvP clans"
Ahh no wonder
Unbrokens aren't anything great generally
But there are some clans who play PvP more than anything else
Are they a streamer clan?
"Primal, BSK, iAM, K9, T1, they're all big name clans. They have some streamers and some people who don't stream but are all about as equally crazy players"
Is there a Destiny tournament scene? Something I can follow?
Yeah. I'm working in the morning so I'm gonna get some sleep but I'll post a shitload of links to channels to watch for sweats and tourneys
Oooh nice that's be very appreciated
All I know is cammycakes and drewskys
"Oh, also Encore is another clan that's well known. CammyCakes, Drewsky, Sidezz, among others are in Encore"
"Yeah, I'll get links in here tomorrow night"
Thank you!!
"I'm trying to practice to see if I can get to Fabled, so trying out the meta builds and all that"
just got my sparrow for solstice!!
Congrats @Buttkikker !! That's quite the grind!
"Met another unbroken player,  which is better than lobbies full of bots I suppose"
hey is anyone down for 2 man shattered throne and/or 200k nighfall?
"Sure, when do you want to do it?"
the sooner the better basicly
"I don't want to do it on arc, so maybe tomorrow?"
ok sure
i should be able to do it most of the day
also is it safe to put mods on the majestic gear or will they be deleted on shadowkeep?
or do we even know
I don't think we know for sure how they'll work
ok im mostly just worried about losing my armament mods but id love to optimize my set
Dismantling gives you back all mods
Oh yeah taken armaments is super useful in throne
the main thing is im not sure if the shadowkeep majestic is its own thing or if your current set is changed
not too big of a deal currently though
No I think they said we'll get a new set
Oh ok then I’m definitely going to have double mods on the full set
"Okay Ron, about to dump a whole bunch of Twitch streams"
"http://www.twitch.tv/velm
http://www.twitch.tv/potatoe_aimer
http://www.twitch.tv/panduh
http://www.twitch.tv/lil_sonic"
Those guys are 4 streaming a current tourney that plays on weekends
There are others that currently aren't streaming it but should be playing?
I'll list them without links
Tournaments for Destiny 2 Crucible or games in general?
Crucible
When I get home I'll mention more names
anyone for a bit of comp?
"Twitch Name - Clan
Wallah - BSK
Foxpax - iAM
Benny - iAM
Lambie - iAM
nferraiu - BSK"
These guys are some of the other players who stream scrims/sweats and tourneys
"Cerridius also streams them occasionally but not as often, he's more of a QP monster than anything"
Those streams would be the ones I keep an eye on for watching sweats
Thanks for the list oath!
Cammy casted one of the previous weekend's tourneys but I don't know if he plans on continuing
I saved it in a sticky for later!
"I highly recommend watching nferraiu, dude is super educational and on arguably the best team right now"
"Masterworks done, baby! Solstice complete"
I am finally levelling up my other characters. Time to go baron hunting.
@RonInDune I'm finally on sorry for the delay my internet has been out all day basically
"It's all good, can we try tomorrow morning maybe?"
I still haven't gotten the majestic set on any char yet soo
Or if anyone else is down go for it!
i just started blues on titan
anyone wanna run gambit matches later?
for the amror
I'm down I still have some work on my warlock.
anyone for gambit @here?
Holy cow this explains a lot about eververse:
Now I don't feel bad about spending silver to buy all the ornaments
well its fair
there are a few questionable things
but overall its worth
where'd u find that excerpt btw?
is that the weekly thingy?
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48058
Time for my Vouchsafe and Conspirator to rule the world again
ugh i hate scout rifles
y not autos
🇵 🇴 🇱 🇦 🇷 🇮 🇸    🇱 🇦 🇳 🇨 🇪
never again
who want s to do a 2 man throne 😄
or a 200k nightfall
dude im getting trolled
im opening solstice packages and i got 4 guantlets
nothing else
...
make that 6
oh my god the micro mini has new sound effects
Ohhh so that's what it was
@Arixama @Matos
anyone up for comp?
"i love that you ""@""'d me on those point, because you are right. Both of those are great"
time to bust out transfiguration!
i'm reading the doc now
"if we have to vote, please vote for gambit prime over regular gambit"
hot key for pursuits!!!!
https://youtu.be/GdOc1s6KF_M
Looool saw this!!! I wonder how it will be developed
Someone nuts enough will do it
Simple as that
I wonder how they will get past the drop down after vault
"Crown, anybody?"
Or scourge or last wish or something else
"I would, but I am working to getting my 200 Arc Super final blows done."
"ahh, no worries at all"
"Yeah my schedule just cleared up, I'm available an hour from now if you need a +1"
So hb 10?
Can we get a squad?
@Trissin ?
"sure, im good"
who wants to run a raid? @here ?
Yeah I'm ready
how many people we got for a raid?
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cq8l72/so_anarchy_has_a_way_of_doing_3x_its_normal/
that's gonna be crazy
"holy crap, now that i'm thinking about it that's a LOT of damage"
https://tenor.com/2Wez.gif
ty for this matos
"Excited for the return of intellect, discipline, strength"
Alright this change alone makes Shadowkeep worth the buy
Dude the reveal was really cool
It was! The news that all legendary gear acquired after shadowkeep will be Armor 2.0 is fantastic news as well.
ABOUT DAMN TIME
now raise the inventory and shader cap
it also gives nice incentive to run old content. Leviathan gear can be relevant now...same with EP gear.
im gunna stock pile some alkane dust and get me a good titan warlock helmet
"yeah...i really love the warlock mars set, so I'm looking forward to it."
im good for most of my stuff since my usual stuff is almost all eververse sets
but i miss my space helmet
i want the dawning armor to come back
"^
dawning armor is really cool]"
sadly i only have the ghosts and the sparrows
but im super pumped about lev gear being relevant again
some of my fav looking armor
wtb raid group 5 gp
The news has freed me from the Soltice grind. Been wearing masterworked EP amor on my titan since year 1. So now I can EP in my EP while i grind for more EP.
"haven't watched this yet, but it looks like it's worth linking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4d9lRPyBY8"
@Chance you were asking me questions that this video will answer
Oh yeah i watched this earlier
pretty excited for armor 2.0
but the perk stacking might be pretty cancer in pvp
are they still giving bright engrams out like they used to ornah?
Stupid question: do u have to use the same color glow as ur subclass?
Or I can just buy the one I like the most and use it all the time
"you can apply any glow ornament to your armor, but if you match it with your subclass then the effects are stronger and more noticeable"
oh so the effects look cooler when they match>
Just somewhat brighter
"Save your materials, everything is jumping up to 750 when shadowkeep launches."
Cool. Not gonna infuse anything
"Best part to me is they're not making Armor 1.0 obsolete, the armor will remain decent but once you can get the proper 2.0 sets you're good to go"
One of the main things I'm concerned about is if the Iron Banner armor I've been collecting will ever be available at least as an ornament for 2.0 armor
"Depends on if it still drops in shadowkeep. They haven't talked about whether old sets of activity armor is going to be dropping from sources at all, other than that faction and trials stuff isn't currently going to be 2.0 because there's no way to obtain them in game currently other than collections"
i'm pretty sure that all 1.0 armor will be available as an ornament when shadowkeep drops
i'm almost certain i've heard or read that from bungo
yea and make sure dismantle every eververse item since all of it can be pulled for legendary shards from your collection
"ok the power sources part has me confused. So there's a hard cap to 950 from regular power sources, and we have to do pinnacle activities to get higher?"
That feels like D2 Y1 doesn't it?
Nope. The way you gained power from year 1 to 2 stayed the same.
950 is the new max
960 will drop from pinnacle activities
as like an exra flex
"Year 1 you had the soft cap, then had to do weeklies and stuff to get to max."
The only exception being the very end of year 1 where the only way to get to 400 was to do eow and SOS prestige
"Hmm, well we'll see how that works in practice"
its already been done
Yeah that's what I confused it with ari
the 960 stuff is just something to chase for those that want it
Surely the max power would be 1000?
"So soft cap is going to be 900, with the hard cap being 950. Then you'll have  the max at whatever that ends up being."
What was the max power at the end of D1?
400
Huh that's lower than I expected
"I mean, once they started the new system, they only had one additional dlc, and then revamped content for the last year"
Also this a gorgeous emblem and I want it so bad:
What was the old system? I though Power/light level was there from the start?
It was level based
Light would increase your level past 20
Cap became 34 with the best gear
"Once TTK started it swapped from Level 34 = Light 170, progressing up to 320, April update brought that to 335, RoI brought that up to 400"
Interesting. Feels like Bungie was literally learning how the game should work as they went along
"Kinda. Remember, Bungie doesn't have any RPG experience prior to Destiny"
That's true. I vaguely remember the Myth games and Oni was mostly pure action
And they've only done Halo and Destiny since
can you remove and reapply mods without any penalty? or does it cost you shit every time?
I think it's 500 glimmer??
i think you just replace it for 500 glimmer
That's what they said at least. Seems like the main cost is unlocking it
"Yeah, they specified small cost:"
okay that's not bad then. especially with the new cap lol.
anyone want to do last wish? need 3
I'd like to do some crown
"I'd love to do any raid honestly, haven't done one in weeks"
"i was also thinking about some heroic menagerie, i think some people still need to do that"
i'm game for crown
crown me
We have 5 then?
well our 3rd isn't 740 minimum
"I think as long as youre above 730 by the end, it's fine"
that's after collecting 2 pieces of powerful loot
he said he's down to try
"If we've got 6, then I'm down"
he's 725 atm
so we'd have 5
he said he's down to try at least
He's 725 right now? that's more than high enough
"Cool, I'm 6th then."
"Great, let's start soon
How long do we need until we're ready?"
I'll need 30ish minutes
"chance and i are ready whenever, our other player is in a comp game of overwatch i think so it'll take a minute"
"Okay, that's fine. 30 mins enough for you @Arixama ?"
@Pessaschitt
"Yeah, definitely"
where's arixama?
Go ahead and join on me when ready
just finishing a gambit
Wow I’ve been so stupid
Hand cannon loader and small arms loader do the same thing XD
Wat a waste of armor pieces
I believe that hand cannon loader is faster because it's more specialized.
Based on the directors cut it seems like they are the exact same
So can we finish up Crown today?
oh y'all were doing crown? i missed out rip
"Anyone willing to try an experiment with me? For Warlock blue solstice armor, I have to kill 200 enemies with Arc super. I need 3 others to help get to phase 2 in the Reckoning, at least past the first bridge point (without me using Well). My goal is not to win Reckoning, but to blast an insane number of shadow thralls and see if it counts toward the Solstice armor."
"Shadow thralls do count, but I finished it pretty easy in the whisper mission"
Takes less time too
"Where are said shadow thrall in whisper? I cannot find them anywhere, and just keep dying"
It's in the big room where you have to take a shortcut
Just fall down it
I can log in and show you?
"You don't need to, but I still don't understand the room. It's been a while, and I'm unfamiliar with whisper again. It's near the end?"
"Yeah it's almost at the end of platforming, but before the big jump down"
The big white room with all the ledges
...all the rooms are big with ledges...
Alright I joined in
Oh oops wrong character
"Thought so. couldn't start it. Heroic, right?"
alternatively you can do blinding well
@PC anyone down for some raids tonight?
I'm down for a couple raids! Won't be on for around another hour though
"@Trissin was going through old D1 videos and found this LOL
https://twitter.com/lgbtholliday/status/1162922945746001920?s=19"
Aww that's the saddest flop
it wasn't enough to just die on the totem. had to fall too lolol.
sadly i missed out on year 2 of d1 but i definitely recognize ~~my favorite scout~~ the objectively best scout in the series @thegoaliebear
VoC was great but once I got Burning Eye that was it lol.
Why is everyone doing EP again? Did I miss an announcement?
Armor drops for shadow keep
Hmm I though they didn't drop powerful rewards
Maybe I'll start doing em too then
After shadowkeep they'll drop the 2.0 versions
Ohhh right I forgot about that
@RonInDune round two of trying to get folks for raid? at least to finish crown or last wish
wtb fireteam to finish raid
5 gp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MspAKr8THf4
pretty sick
and they revealed details about the raid and all
pretty cool
"Yeah I've started to filter out all news now, too many spoilers"
yea im def not reading too much of it
like they are showing vids of the first strike and story mission and im not gonna watch those
at that point ur just telling us whats gonna happen
i'm late to the solstice armor grind and it's a pain
like i'm still not even done with the green. almost there tho
Yeah it's a grind lol
Let us know if u need any help
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8mC5GaDoyQ  Season of the Undying Trailer. No spoilers but it looks incredibly dope.
Time to bounce some juice boxes i guess.
"well i just got my blue armor and i need 75 solar WEAPON guardian kills. i don't have any solar crucible weapons, so i guess it's time to start running lord of wolves"
"pray for my soul, for this will surely damn it"
Lmaoooo I promise it's not as bad as u think
"Maybe do your gambit games first, I think it counts teammate kills and invaders might use solar weapons"
Fireteam member kills count
That means invaders running fixed odds will make progress
"thanks for the advice, will do"
sadly i **REALLY** hate gambit
i forgot just how much i hated it until today
but you gotta do the 10 gambits for purples
"yes i'm aware, thanks ari"
thank you so much for reminding me that i have to play gambit
i hadn't played gambit for over 3 months until i had to for the solstice gear lmao. playing it only reminded my why i hate it so much.
okay come on gambit isn't that bad
"solo queuing with blueberries isn't great, but it's a lot of fun playing with friends in comms"
playing with people makes it bearable. but I'd still rather be doing anything else.
I'd play pvp over gambit.
"Hmm, not sure I'd do the same"
Everything's got its ups and downs
"I kind of like gambit, plus I like how grinding for pinnacles changes up the meta"
"Getting Hush was a nice experience, the medals part was a bit much but otherwise I loved getting good with Le Monarque"
"Hush is definitely fun, yeah
I dunno about that journey though"
Plus if @Buttkikker or @Matos is around Gambit becomes easy mode
"It was kinda cool to switch up the loadout and use a bow, but after like 2 matches i was more like ""how much longer until I can go back to a real setup"""
Yeah lol
It was fun playing gambit without relying completely on Jotunn
i feel like season of drifter ruined it for me. I'm all about pve endgame so reckoning was incredibly underwhelming and having everything centered around gambit prime was like...okay.
"Oh yeah I fully agree there, Reckoning was the worst"
https://tenor.com/view/jean-ralphio-parks-and-rec-the-worst-gif-4963524
i got one full notorious set and never bothered with anything else until the Outbreak mission happened lol.
Atleast it seems like Bunige learned the lesson to not center an entire season around a side activity
reckoning was fun the first few times and then it just got stale. but yeah i absolutely agree limiting an entire block of content to something you do on the side was awful.
"it wasnt really meant to be a side activity though? it was meant to expand gambit and the lore behind it, there just wasnt a lot they could do with the way that stuff was all working together."
True the lore itself was pretty cool
"The environment, as usual, was gorgeous"
i think reckoning would have been an entirely different creature if we had gotten the super exotic nerfs at the start of jokers wild.
yeah that's exactly the point of why it flopped so hard haha. gambit prime wasn't *supposed* to be a side thing...but the entire category of gambit *is*
i did enjoy the lore surrounding the season...but as far as content goes...oof.
"jokers wild had the revelry, right?"
what was that? lol tells how irrelevant that entire season was.
"the event, with the verdant forest."
wait was that just the reskinned halloween forest?
"basically. different mechanics, but yeah"
ah i remember. the one week event that perfectly corresponded to the week my team was at the NCAA tournament lol.
i just...didnt give one shit about anything that happened until Outbreak arrived. they had to get people back in somehow😜😂😂
"i liked the invitations of the nine, it was a cool way to release the lore they wanted"
still haven't finished those
or the allegiance quest
I just read them on ishtar collective 😂
on any of my characters
"Yeah no matter how boring an event, if they have lore hidden behind it I'll get 'em all"
you're not missing anything lol @Trissin
oh lmao
allegiance quest was decent enough.
There's something cool about going to some obscure location for a lore piece
"the allegiance quest was only really important to have done during season of the drifter, but im hoping that it effects future content as well"
Do I hear people talking smack about Gambit in here?!
yeah it's ass.
😜
i hope we start getting some new cabal this year. im tired of red legion somehow still being around
lol same.
"they never give up, do they?"
Well that was fucking dumb. Just got DDOS'd at 2500 Glory lmao
but of course.
Hope Bungie bans them
"Basically fuck all I can do, I don't think I'll get the post game report so can't even report them lol"
"god, stop being so good."
get bad
I wasn't even aimbot Oath
Was a rough game
come on they gotta guarantee their paid carries by any means necessary😜
Wouldn't be surprised lol
people who DDOS are just...sad...lmao.
a couple of weeks ago i was doing comp with trissin and matos and we got matched into a game with one other person
and we were all trying to figure out if this dude ddosd the other team when we loaded in. but we just ended up with a free win
i got ddosd several times back in the trials of the nine days. love to see it.
but with how much people will pay for Lunas and Not Forgotten recovs...i don't doubt lots of people do that crap. it's unfortunate but...guess realistically it's a small portion
Just means I'm gonna look into a VPN
yeah...especially with comp going 3v3 Survival. can imagine that kind of stuff will be a bit more common to experience.
who tryna finish up that raid we started
"4 stacking in crucible will always be better than 4 stacking in gambit. still not fun, just less awful. end of discussion. good night"
"I actually like top tree striker with the disco helmet, still pretty strong without being completely broken"
The only reason that works is no one respects the shoulder charge
"If someone actually respects that you have it, that tree falls apart"
I wish it had inertia override
"Bottom tree is miles better, and OEM just makes the neutral so painful to play against lol"
really hope they just nerf OEM and striker into the ground so people actually have to be good at the game lmao.
OEM is fine imo if your marked don’t be dumb and peak
Bottom tree striker tho
That’s some dumb shit
"OEM isn't as bad. Just makes it more painful to play against. Got less of an issue with it now unless I see ""Marked for Vengeance x 2"" or ""x 3"""
"I've seen a single ""x 4"" debuff"
I was proud of that one
IT IS TIME
Well that was fairly simple
"I can continue to play till then, right"
"yup,the actual transfer to steam doesnt happen til october"
i love how it doesn't allow me to hit I agree on the page on mobile lmaooo
is it a scrollable thing?
It is
will we be able to predownload
"Yeah that sucks, see if you can force desktop mode"
might need to scroll all the way through
i dont want to wait a day on new content day
yeah. so what exactly does this do just allows everything to be transferred to steam but then when cross save happens my PS4 will take over when i select as my primary account yes?
"Honestly it should be a 1-1 transition, we should be able to swap the game files over"
i believe so. it's mostly important for the people who have been mainly playing on pc up to now. people on ps4 and xbox probably dont have to do it?
we havent gotten anything specific about preloading @Jump
well...if i don't do it then i would have to rebuy everything on steam right?
Yeah it transfers your licenses
guess it's mainly just so the liscenses transfer?
its just to ensure u bought the content
"thats probably true. i assume since they can lock you out of using stuff based on platform currently, itll probably be similar with the old expansions if you start playing on a different system"
yeah it makes sense. bc i ain't buying all that again lmao. besides my ps4 will take over for cross save anyway.
Oh so 960 *is* the new power cap
"Yes, but you can only get there by doing prestige activities"
That'll be a fun grind
"Hmm this week seems pretty good for Heroic Menagerie, if people want to run it"
Attrition is kind of annoying
I'm always down
"But we never have the interest for it, unfrotunately"
I really want to do it but oh well
Wait I never checked but are the loadouts locked during the encounter?
"No, you can switch throughout the run"
flawless on this boss is fairly easy.
"ooh nice, what's the strat here?"
Wells at each spot?
3 banner shields and 3 wells. two wells with Phoenix and one with Lunas. banner shields should run ursas. you basically just chain wells and banner shields constantly.
during damage on the side plates when the cyclops spawn you need one shield facing the boss and one facing middle to block that angle. take your time to take down all cyclops and as many adds as possible and use a well if you have to even if you're not capping a plate.
is is the ogre this week?
Nah it's the Hydra
Thanks for the strat @thegoaliebear !!
Now I really want to try it once
I probably won't be playing much more till Shadowkeep so I want to finish up the small stuff
NinjaPups has a good video on the strat as well.
im always down for heroic menagerie
u just have to mention it in the chat
the problem is right now most people are still grinding for solstice
so let that go by
Speaking of which... anyone care to grind for solstice with me?
"I need gambit matches, and I prefer to play with buddies"
ahh man if only u said that this morning i ran 10 matches
i finished all my armour and im so sick of gambit
at least EAZ?
#nerfOEM2019
"also chance was telling me this but i'm gonna be very upset if i take his word for it and he's wrong, so i'm gonna ask here. i only have to get my solstice armor to purple before event ends and then i'm good, right?"
Yeah that's right
You can masterwork later
"aight cool, thanks"
"So literally all I have left for Warlock armor is 4 Gambit matches; however, Bungie thought this would be a great time to start giving be BEETs, potentially banning me from gambit until after solstice. any ideas?"
not trusting my word : (
"@RonInDune here is the video on this week's flawless. explains really well. 
https://youtu.be/tUyFV2vMYyQ"
i was about to offer being available to help with heroic menagerie but keep forgetting i don't have the annual pass on PC lmao.
anyone wanna play comp?
"I wouldn't mind crucible, though I don't know how good I'll be in comp; working on Hunter solstice"
im at heroic 1
just wanna get to fabled and be done
I'm at 2500 so you guys probably wouldn't want to queue with me
brave 1...
sad do u have a smurf @Oathbreaker  XDXD
Pffft
I wish I had a smurf with good gear
Should have picked up a second account when the game was free for a week
do u know where to find a solid group for comp?
"Honestly no. I've been looking for a team lately that I gel with and the LFG Discord is such a shitshow. Solo queue comp is risky but you might run into players you do well with. I know in Nomad's server (the one I admin for and help run events on for PvP improvement) there's an LFG but there will be massive skill variation. I know people have grouped together that way, and stuck as a team but it takes time and a lot of effort"
yea literally me
i remember in smite it took a while to find a solid team
i actually ended up picking players from plat so i could train em and make em work together
the lfgs are just filled with either cheesers or overconfident smucks
Pretty much.
what'd u say ur glory was again?
2500ish
That was really only playing comp when I felt like it
did u solo q?
And when I have people I can group with
"Duo'd, trio'd, once or twice 4 stacked"
ugh i just wanna get recluse for the season and be done
I was only playing when someone else asked me tbh
ill play again when they fix crucible  lol
They won't. Not for some time.
@Oathbreaker will u play with me XD
"It'll average out our Glory, and with you being lower compared to me it'll put our glory somewhere around 1900ish? Then it'll expand outwards. Not a good time to play anyways. Midday midweek is not a great time, basically only the people who play 24/7 will be on"
oh lol i was only trolling XD
but yea that makes sense
"Besides, this season I've basically only been scrimming people and haven't really played comp too much, or even QP"
dude i feel u
u need a team so u can just teamshoot
"Last night was my first QP game in a while and I ended up dropping a 33 defeat game with a 5.0KDA (27 kills, 4.5KD)"
90% of the games from last night ended up with around that amount of defeats
yikes
I mean I have like a 95% win rate in Control and a 85% in Clash
QP is boring to me these days
Oh and solstice buffs remain stupid
i'm at around 2500 glory and i found a group on the100.io to four stack with. got Recluse done in one 2.5 hour session and went 11-0.
"they do have PC lfg. so i would recommend that site because you might find a group there that's available when you are. i remember when we were trying to coordinate for PS4 but we never found a time where we could just grind it out for a few hours, so that was unfortunate."
"Still getting BEET gambit matches. I'm playing against bots, for crying out loud, I had better not get banned before solstice ends"
the100.io is a good idea. Pretty good group sorting too
yeah it's a good site. always lots of stuff on there.
Yep. Found a lot of groups to run with through them back on Destiny 1
which site?
the100.io
"you can specify the activity and platform:
https://www.the100.io/gaming_sessions"
"Yeah @Oathbreaker recommended some great streams for me, and I feel like watching those helped me out a bit. Still not winning but atleast I'm not bottom every single game"
Plus I gave up and embraced the cheese
First solstice set complete- Warlock!
Congratulations!!
my problem is im consistently top 2 in crucible but in survival blueberries waste lives so fast
blueberries in comp are such a hit or miss lol.
actually
well i just played three matches
its literally garbage
does anyone here at all wanna play comp? i just need one other decent player to even the odds here
when i cross save i can play some this weekend if you're around. but again i am around 2500.
"I'll be playing 3 games anyway to keep up my streak, I can drop in"
i cant its like im playing against lebron everygame
and for some reason my team just cant play
It's probably due to it being a weekday afternoon
Only the best and worst are on
but how come im the only one getting garbage XD
while the other team has kobe
You got cursed by a witch when you were young
that i already know
i had 1200 golry this morning
im at 700 now
ive only won one game
Take a break
"literally my team is like.36, .25, .78"
"Yeah you should probably stop then, that kinda streak is really tilting"
Stop the downwards slide
thing is that im on point rightnow
my aim is so good rn
im feeling great
Sometimes you can't carry though man
Blueberries will be blueberries
Sometimes that means you won't be able to win
ugh
i thought fps would be better than mobas in this regard
it would be better if supers werent absolutely broken
so at least i wouldnt just insta die
what is the max infamy for gambit again?
15000
"Cross save is apparently working reliably now so if anyone was waiting, go for it"
now down to 500
ive tried 4 different lfg teams
from 100.io and the discord server
all hope is lost
All that remains is twitch carries
ive lost 7 games in a row
5 out of them i was top scorer
the matchmaking gods are screwing me so hard today
i would probably stop and try it again tomorrow
yea thats the only option but like now i just feel cheated
you play worse when you get mad
but see thats the thing i guess oath was right
my aim right now is on point its just matchmaking is really not in my favour today
maybe ill try again later tonight
I wouldn't suggest doing so
Do me a favor
Go and record a QP match
Upload it to YouTube
And send it to me
"Don't make it a good one or a bad one, just send me one and I'll look it over"
ill try that later for now im gonna take a looooonnnnnnggggg shower
ill just send u the next one i play
first i gotta find a software for recording
Shadowplay
If you have an Nvidia GPU you have one built in
oh yea thats right
i havent used that in a while
AMD has one too but I don't remember what it's called
i used it to record smite videos XD
ill send u one acutally in a few
lemme get shadowplay set up
I’m sorry @Oathbreaker
Yesterday I put my sweatiest shirt on and went from 500 glory to 1950
Was up till 4am
"I mean, it's a good climb, I just definitely would not have recommended it because of the slide downwards"
Yea I think looking back I should have realized it was blueberry hours earlier and stopped
Later at night the quality of players on both sides were good so at least lives weren’t being thrown in the toilet
^^^^^^^^
Ooh the Mars community challenge emblem looks pretty fine
Also this is new:
Has Bungie ever done challenges like these before?
the only other one i can thing of is in last week TWAB
Which is the fashion community challenge
True but that one's a lot more subjective
(I'll go in as a super emo all black hunter)
i don't think we've ever had one of these before. likely due to SK being delayed so they needed something for us to do haha.
Huh yeah that makes sense. Easy to implement tasks
Also @thegoaliebear are you still sick? Hope you get better soon!
LOL nooo I'm a senior in college😂😂😂
sorry I'm dumb
hahaha no worries but once i hit spring semester it's gonna be a legit diagnosis😂
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do well once you're in the thick of it
hoping to win back to back league championships so that will make the depression we go through kind of worth it.
I'm rooting for ya!
"Which sport, by the way?"
Maybe they need more ghosts for the moon...?
ice hockey as per my discord pic aha @RonInDune
You can do it!!
"I've never played ice hockey, but I *have* seen bits of The Mighty Ducks so I'm pretty much an expert"
lolol that's all you need to know
GAAHHH! 1 more gambit match and I still can't get in on a game! I hate beets now.
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do an LW sherpa run tonight? i know a guy hasn't done it yet but would like to. would be around 9:30 EST.
"sure, why not?"
cool. so two more then.
I'm In
awesome.
since i am new to the PC thing do you guys use a discord chat or just game chat.
We just use the discord channels here
I'm down to do it
If there is room
okay. is it possible for someone not in this server to join the chat @Arixama
@MrTster yes we have one spot left.
Yeah I'll do it
They would have to join the server in order to join the chat Goal
you could also just do a private call
"okay, we can do that then. do you have to be friends with each other on Discord to do it?"
Just the host
"Yeah, just the host."
"actually, as long as they are friends with someone, they can be invited in by said friend"
"okay, i will send him a friend request then so we can get him in."
wait goal are you on pc now?
Crosssave baby
won't be often but yes i can do up to Forsaken stuff.
damn aight
I'm going to attempt this on kb+m but if i suck too much I'll just switch to my controller haha.
I think platforming might be the only thing that's super challenging
i'm gonna recommend that you don't try kbm because once i got used to it i just couldn't go back
"not because i didn't want to, but because i actually lost the ability to aim with controller"
"i just think kb+m still feels a bit weird for me. and, i don't want to screw things up just because i'm a potato with it currently haha."
i'll just stick to controller for now.
"it's definitely an adjustment for the first little while, but a lot better once you get through that"
sticking with controller is probably a good call if you won't be on pc that much
"If it makes you feel any better, I'll probably be slightly sucking on Saturday on ps4 @thegoaliebear"
haha fair.
so what do i do with controller just plug it in once I've booted up D2 or can i do it before that?
Which controller you using?
ps4
I would assume it works like the Xbox controllers and just detects when you use it.
teddy said it was just plug and play for him aha...so should just be that.
but just wanted to make sure.
I know when I turn on my controller I have to hit a button to actually get it to recognize I'm using a controller when I do
okay cool👍
when you see your characters in 120 fps for the first time:
!pop
@thegoaliebear how many more do you need?
we have a full group.
"After I finish this public event, I'll be in orbit"
im ready whenever
Yup me too
"This may be a bad time to realize, but do I need to do anything for cross platform right now to get tonight to work?"
whoever has all of us added should set up the party chat here.
"@Thawxtem I don't think you need to do anything right now, but don't forget to get the steam migration process rolling"
one sec i can't hear you guys but I think my mic is working.
how'd the raid go
wait ya'll are probably still going
at vault rn.
I remember vault being really confusing the first time
it absolutely was haha. now it's my fave encounter just for the music lol.
Lol I’ll save that for riven
Too bad it only takes like a minute to beat her
1K voices!!
eyy congrats!!'
that was long but fun haha...enjoyed raiding on PC.
"A bit frustrating at times, but a fun time for sure"
it's definitely the toughest D2 raid to teach I think. just bc of its length. SoS is probs next hardest to sherpa.
I'm also not the *best* teacher 🤷‍♂️
You're pretty good Ari!
"I'm pretty sure I used ""things"" as a descriptor multiple time in the same explanation multiple times 🤣"
It's a fairly versatile word
@Jump decided against gambit after all?
oh oops sorry i just logged off XD
i ccan hop back on if u want
i just didnt get a response and im tabbed out
I did respond... a lot
doesn't matter;
oof im so sorry i was tabbed ou
out*
i can hop back on
gimme a sec
"nah, just needed one match, and im in one"
next time just ping me on discord
anyone interested in reckoning in a bit?
i have to do 4 runs for the synth upgrade
Maybe later in the evening for sure
how many tiers does the synth have
"Also, Xur's selling the Arbalest if anyone didn't get it during the revelery get it now"
yea he's in nessus at the barge
I just realized my Hunter doesn’t have access to the Whisper Thrall-way. Anyone feel like helping out with normal Whisper mission tonight?
Consider it done
Sure I can join in
Gotta do it on my titan
"We can have a team of three; in the worst case, my Titan doesn’t have it either. Also, it’ll probably be about 2 1/2 hours from now at the earliest."
Yeah that's fine wiht me
I don't think I can do that. Early start for me tomorrow :/
"RonInDune and I two-manned it just fine, @Oathbreaker"
Finally sat down and got sweaty again. Reached fabled! @Oathbreaker
It really is rough people are carrying god roll spare rations and beloved everywhere
anyone down for gambit
i have to finish the malfeasance quest
im on the last step
mostly done just having a tough time with the kill 4 people in one invade
Petition to ban gambit
denied what's wrong with gambit
motion passed
No! I still need gambit for solstice!
"Speaking of which, just got second character done. You guys think it's possible to do a third from green?"
Which set you still need?
Titan
"so mostly depends on how hard you go, but i think you can do it"
the titan set is probably the easiest imo
Yeah Titan is for sure not very tough
"I'm 95% done with it, just need Strike void orbs, which I'll get on void day"
"I'll save that for last, and do it with you if you like"
@Pentan approved.
👍❤️👌🤘💪🤝
Lol y the hate on gambit
I quite enjoy it
It’s really fun when u roll a stack with comps
Comms*
"It's an unenjoyable mode that while works in concept falls flat in execution. Very similar to Competitive playlist for PvP.
(All my opinion)
Pros: Interesting concept, decently designed maps, interesting themes, pretty cool gear and guns.
Cons: Horribly designed heavy ammo system, almost always required to stack in order to be most effective, bugs or other issues with the mode that can be solved or may be difficult (but still possible to solve), literally just a boss rush with very basic mechanics at best. Only interaction with the other team is through invading which teammates can hog (unless you stack).

Just off the top of my head."
I agree with heavy
Bugs are in everything so I won’t foul it that much and I haven’t experienced many
I could def see potential to making the boss fight more interesting
However I think ur missing the strategy involved
"What strategy? Get heavy, go invade. Win."
There’s a lot of strategy in how banking and carrying motes
Blocker strategy? Bah. Spam 5s or 10s at most.
Timing invades too
I wouldn’t agree
Minimal strategy at best.
Having a 15 with two 5s is more effective
But then again if ur invading a captain is best
"Most matches I play do so in the exact same method. One team gets heavy, invades, gets the lead, snowballs."
The 10s
Well that’s cuz the playlist is horribly designed
They shouldn’t mix comp with casual
"If you are required to stack in order to be most effective and to avoid blueberries who don't know what they're doing, the mode is flawed."
This is also true for Comp.
If they had a comp playlist I feel more 4 stacks would go and have a better exp
They can release good ad clear weapons as incentive
I don’t agree with that viewpoint
If that were the case then raids are the worst mode
I'm saying with playlist modes.
Raids are entirely different.
Then menagerie would be considered bad
I think being more effective as a stack should be true
More teamwork should equal better results
But then again I come from a moba background
Where teamwork is core
Though even halo saw that difference too
"It is, for a number of reasons. Takes too long to get loot, blueberries make it unbearable when they do stupid shit"
Just my view however
"I'm aware teamwork should award better results. I don't disagree. But when it basically becomes the only way to deal with another team, then the mode becomes unfun."
"Again, this is a flaw with comp as well"
Well I can understand that point but there’s really no way to solve that unless u remove stacking
Any mode that allows pairing will generally benefit from it
I could make that argument for strikes as well
Anyway point is I think gambit is fun and could def get much better
"Strikes are an entirely different thing altogether though? It's only PvE. In a mode where facing a stack and having no way to compete because the blueberries on your team refuse to bank and run past the bank at 15 motes unless you slay out is ridiculous. Making solos have to rely on teammates who don't know what they're doing and hope that they can somehow pull out a win doesn't make sense as a mode.

You yourself were complaining about comp recently. Similar situation."
Yea however I accept blueberries are bad for any competitive multiplayer mode where stacking is allowed
Anyway I’m trying to brainstorm ideas to make gambit better
And I think the first thing is a way to make boss phases better
"I think heavy ammo is what break gambit more than anything else. 

Having taken/fallen/hive armaments mean people have bascially inifinite heavy"
So yesterday I actually got to meet the voice actor for Ghaul
Congrats
Dude that’s awesome!
Did u tell him to I Am GHAAAAULLLLL
That line always gives me a chuckle
finally on to blue titan. 24 hours long enough?
The 50 bounties are the biggest challenge
Had 18 saved up
"Doing each world bounty gives 25-ish, so you're almost there"
"Not to mention I haven't done all the planet bounties yet today, so if I do them before bed/reset, I'll have a good number available tomorrow"
...I just remembered Banshee had bounties...
Yeah do those every day! You end up with tons of masterwork cores
Also eververse bounties don't have a limit on them so you can keep picking them up
Once you complete them
"figured I'd pick those up in the background and keep working on them. In the end, they may have to be the same bounties I'm forced to complete over and over due to running out."
i want an ornament that makes the tractor cannon look like a portal gun
Anyone willing to help get arc kills in the crucible?
sorry. trying to finish up warlock. i need solar
my recommendation is to do gambit first and hope that your teammates get some arc kills when the invade
"definitely won't finish the whole thing, but it might help"
Put on an arc smg and you'll get 'em in no time
riskrunner
and misfit
"Misfit is super underrated for how good it is, absolutely shreds people"
who aren't expecting it
uh... i just got an invitation from the emperor?? something about a tribute hall?
I think you just started the Tribute Hall quest?
get thee to nessus
i'm on nessus
Talking to the robot?
i think i got it when i opened one of the the chests
By the robot?
no the ones in the d1 tower
yes by the robot
Well for tribute hall there's one right by the robot. Not with the rest of them
yeah that's what i opened
"I think there should be a new destination for you now, in the nessus page, right by the Leviathan raids"
sure is
"First, visit Werner in the nessus barge, that should properly start the quest"
http://orcz.com/Destiny_2:_Visit_Werner_99-40_-_Invitation_of_the_Emperor
i already started it though
"Ah I forgot what the exact steps are, just talk to the Calus statue in the Tribute hall next maybe"
@Pentan do you still need the strike part of the armor?
"nope, i'm done with strikes"
"i need gambit matches, titan scout missions, and one more run on eaz"
everything else should just come naturally
Let me know when you're up for gambit (hopefully prime) and I'll join you if you like
"@Thawxtem @Chance let's go, gambit matches rn"
"fighting boss in strike, 1 sed"
"@Thawxtem @Chance about to get back on, what did I miss"
almost done with out titan shit
"hey guys, i'm gonna make a poll"
"Is it cannibalism if you eat your own arm? ✅ for yes, ❌ for no"
"You wanna get technical with it, it's auto-cannibalism"
"I just opened like 90 solstice packages and got like, maybe 8 or 9 pieces of solstice armor"
F
won't matter when 2.0 comes out
But how many enhancement cores did you get?
"alright, i finished my solstice grind"
time to not touch this game again until shadowkeep
tractor cannon + retold tale is my new favorite build
"oh wait, i have 40 packages to open"
I did...all 3 of my characters
im okay
my soul has not been completely ripped from my body
lol i literally only did warlock
haven't played anything but warlock since forsaken. even then i barely touched hunter
"Trissin and Ari, the absolute madmen, did all 3 the first week"
i believe it
"they're nuts, of course, but i believe it"
"I did Warlock and Titan, just trying to get hunter to blue"
why even go for blue if you know you won't get purple
literally no point
not sure lol
minor sense of accomplishment?
go to sleep my guy 😂
Eh I won't be playing much destiny any time soon
Control releases tomorrow!
by tomorrow I mean today
"i'll tell you one thing. i thought my will to play this game would be completely drained after that grind, and i'm sure it would be  if i did all 3 characters, but now that i have something to show off and since i haven't been completely worn out on it, i find myself wanting to play it"
yeah that's very true
i was talking with chance earlier and i wonder how many players will have solstice armor when shadowkeep drops
how special will we be
"will my light up sketchers stand out, or will half the playerbase be walking around glowing like it's laser tag"
i really can't wait for armor 2.0
once i get my 2.0 solstice stuff i'm just never gonna wear any other armor
alright. gn lads. get some sleep @RonInDune
Finally finished all Solstice gear & got sparrow. too tired to try it out.
first 3 weeks thats nothing
i did my warlock AND titan IN 4 FUCKING DAYS
Solstice looks pretty ugly imo I’m just gonna slap the eververse ornaments over it
u say that now but when that sweet new armor from shadowkeep comes out u'll forget about solstice gear real quick
plus the fact that escalation protocol gear is also gonna be 2.0
make sure to get the glows u want i think today is last day
Congrats @Thawxtem and @Chance! That was quite the grind!
Gonna be wearing this set forever
"@RonInDune if you havent started playing control yet, id definitely suggest headphones if you can"
yeah I just started! Headphones are perfect
Holy crap the game is soo good
It really is
is it weird that after all that soul rending grind that i want to play the ACTUAL game now
and this week is iron banner....
could go after that swarm of the raven
Swarm with spikes
U need it
"Playing crucible on Titan is one of the last (and worst, for me) things I had to do for solstice. Now it’s IB, and I’m only missing Titan armor. Why do Shaxx and Saladin hate me so much?"
Obviously cause you don't like titans 🤷‍♂️
Easy solution: ||just don’t play titan||
@Chance I had the same feeling
Also what’s this control thing everyone is going on about? You mean like the crucible game mode?
fuck titan
hunter or warlock
just in case any of you haven't done this yet
i'd hate to see anyone forget
"Control is a game made by Remedy, who I'm pretty sure made Quantum Break, Alan Wake, and the first two Max Payne games. Just got released recently."
Wait they're fixing both the Wendigo and the Mountaintop questlines?
The Wendigo wasn't that bad of a grind was it? I remember finishing it without too much difficulty
Hush was way worse
It's more of a tedious grind reliant on a pretty tedious activity. They could easily fix wendigo grind by making available in any strikes
"I almost forgot, Widow's Court is coming back!!!"
That makes me happy
Thoughts @Oathbreaker ?
Widows court is?
I GET TO FUCKING SNIPE AGAIN YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
:D
A map?
A FUCKING GOOD MAP
Love that map
Are there any others they're bringing back?
It’s the one with the church in the middle right?
That map is dope
One of the better d1 maps imo
Oh I remember the clip from the ViDoc
i never played D1 but if you say its a sniping map then you have me interested
it's good for sniping and also some nice close range engagements if you're in the church area. but you can basically spawn snipe lol
"Earlier it seems my message was misread; I don’t hate Titans, it’s just that killing guardians with arc weapons as a Titan that (to me) focuses more on melee attacks and such was the most painful task of all guardians for me, since I was doing it alone when I couldn’t get help (and I’m bad at PvP)"
Nah I was making a  joke 🤣
I was so excited that I finally finished my last guardian legendary solstice set...
I was tired at 3 in the morning...
I was so desperate to get off and take a good rest...
...that I forgot to open the countless solstice boxes that I saved up for this moment.
Oh nooooooo
"After the finishing the green sets, I honestly never thought about them again. I just started ignoring the keys that I would get after nearly any event completed."
"Not sure if everyone has seen this yet, it's a pretty interesting read about the next year of Destiny 2:

http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48097"
Sounds like you have to buy the battle pass on top of the season pass
"It is pretty interesting, especially the Season Pass XP. Hmm."
"Also, ||Season of Dawn|| is going to follow ||Season of the Undying||"
anyone up for farming IB?
Huh I didn't realize just how common the Dredgen title is
"Also The MMXIX Seal is around 9.99% I think, according to Braytech"
"Also, oof on the Unbroken"
"Only 0.37% of the population has Unbroken, and I seem to be a fucking magnet for them"
I mean you're honestly good enough to beat a majority of them
Everytime I played a match on pc I had at least 1 unbroken in my game
Oh I have no issues playing them
I just see so damn many
Especially cause I'm sure a fair few paid for it🤣
I recognize names at this point
"Pfft, those are the fun ones"
"""This guy's bank account is broken"""
I'm also surprised so many people have reached Legend
3.52%!
Also what weapons do you get for reaching Legend?
Not Forgotten
and the MIDA catalyst right?
Not Forgotten. That's it.
"MIDA Catalyst does come from legend, yes."
Is the MIDA really that good? I like it but still
No lol
Not even with catalyst
"fyi guys if you want silver before shadowkeep, you only have until the 3rd to buy it"
"so the one triumph is collecting weapons by reaching fabled in multiple seasons, but does that track the weapons collected, or is it actually gatekept by seasons?"
I think it's just collected
"so you could get the triumph by getting nf, mountaintop and recluse in a single season?"
"You mean Luna's, right?"
NF is Legend rank and requires Luna's
Okay good
Just wanted to double check
"i mean, if you got nf  you got a weapon by getting to fabled :BAha:"
New raid loot is reskinned eververse armor. Yikers.
we have it in #destiny-spoilers too. hoping it's just a placeholder.
and it looks like the exotic trace rifle from the raid is part of the collections badge so...lets just hope that's a quest based item and we don't have another 1KV situation💀
Yeah it fucking sucksss
and here we were thinking they learned how to structure a good title chase with Shadow lmaooo.
guess they realized the fact that people still don't have 1KV after 100+ chests was the artificial difficulty we really need.
They gotta keep you playing the game so they can sell you some eververse stuff lol
LOL yeah tho.
"That settles it, I’m starting the unbroken grind. You with me @Oathbreaker?"
Hmm the mountaintop quest changes are very nice
that wasn't the raid gear
it was the gear from the new ativity
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/eyok386?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x
wow rip
The raid weapons look cool.
"Haven't been keeping up, where are you guys finding all of this? Reddit?"
yes dmg confirmed the reskinned eververse set is the new raid armor lmao.
maybe there will be ornaments or something for it? idk i'm just wishful thinking rn because that's really disappointing lol.
@Trissin people are putting screenshots from PAX up on the subreddit.
"Ah, makes sense."
new warlock exotic
oh my that's crazy
"watch me Chunce and ovenjohnson try to get 400k score on the corrupted, streams going up in just a couple minutes"
stream is up
https://www.twitch.tv/ouronlychunce
https://www.twitch.tv/ovenjohnson
"it was a bust, we had a luck streak but it ended swiftly"
"hello, looking for some backup people for leviathan sherpa raid- teaching a 9 year old. Starting in 15 minutes"
I would join but I'm out right now!
Did you move to PC @camembertbear ??
@Trissin it's a special case- just to sherpa this 9YO  buddy. but cross save makes it easy. still using a ps4 controller since idkwtf is going on with keyboard and mouse
it's quite comical
Ouuuu I see
Sorry I can't help but good luck!!
How do I tell if I correctly enabled cross-save?
"If you go in game it should have a ""crosssave enabled"" tag"
Where do I find this tag?
When you mouse over your emblem in the roster
"Sorry, thought I said that 😂"
"Now I'm worried that I linked it to a non-existent account, because I can't find the tag"
"When you log in, on the character select screen there should also be the icon"
Like so
How long did you wait?
It was pretty much instant. Did you make sure that you authenticated all of the accounts linked to your bungie account?
"I missed out when they were removed on D2, but could someone explain the benefits/exclusives of the 3 Factions in D1?"
faction gear and weapons and an exotic class items quest. and they were accessible constantly there were no faction rallies in D1.
"Details for the update are out, it might be time to grind some reckoning"
oh whats new?
I'll grid the the gambit armours for sure
"Cool, are you on PC criz?"
Yes just moved
"Nice, welcome!"
thx ^^
"Lately our group has been a lot less active since destiny is kind of on a down right now, since solstice just finished and the season is nearly over"
But I might be on a bit more this week for reckoning weapons and the mars challenge
That's awesome to hear :).
@Trissin Btw with crossplay being active are you thinking of merging the clan on each platform?
The biggest problem is the size that clans are allowed. 100 members isn't nearly enough for people across all 3 platforms
ah well thats a bummer
"^^
This is also why we had 2 separate clans for Xbox and PS4 for D1"
You should be able to upgrade your clan to have more members imo
Does Warframe have a limit on their clans?
"No, but requirements for research increase the more members you have"
At this point there's really no reason to have a limit on clan members for Destiny since they already have in game limits on leveling up and stuff.
"Clans that have 10 members require less resources and such for blueprints, whereas clans with 1000 members or more have massively increased requirements in comparison"
yeah seems like a better system
"I think the only issues with destiny's current system is that it's not super beneficial to be in a small personal clan, and the clan member limit doesn't make sense with their current clan xp system"
"Lunafaction Boots and Rally Barricades look like they're getting tuned: ||they no longer auto-reload, instead increase reload speed||"
Excited for that honestly
It'll be an interesting change
"||Loaded Question|| and ||breech-loaded GLs|| are gonna be weaker, but meanwhile this is actually quite a buff for ||Izanagi's||"
can't wait to still never play reckoning lmao.
@CrizMobius will you be solely on PC now?
bc your clan is tied to whichever account you set as your primary for your cross save characters. so you can leave the PS4 clan if you will be primarily on PC.
Yeah I'll probably go 100% PC
I'm addicted to frames
okay cool. so yeah then leave PS4 clan and join PC clan so that way you can get the clan rewards and whatnot.
"ok so I've been out of Destiny for a week, did they say anything about the Mars resonant stem nodes? Better chance of getting a new one maybe?"
not really there's a just a community Mars event this week.
So anyone feel like doing a heroic menagerie one of these days? Apparently the Izanagi Catalyst is going to be super important
i still haven't bothered to get that gun lmao.
It’s really good imo
It's bit of a grindy quest
But the gun feels and works super well
i've been just fine without it lol. don't really wanna waste my time.
doing old content that i didn't find fun.
Nooo izanagi is so cool
"Not really grindy, just rng based"
yeah that's gonna be a hard no from me.
after 1KV i will never get hung up on something that requires RNG again.
Cause you've gotta get one of the rare black armory bounties for it
"Honestly all of the Black Armory weapons have been excellent, better than aything from the other seasons"
i legitimately have never had a rare BA bounty drop.
"so, hard pass."
the best Original weapons for sure
anyone down for a raid later tonight?
the only BA weapons i consistently use are Jotunn and hammerhead lol.
Blast Furnace/jotunn was my PvP combo for so long
I used Le Monarque for Gambit bow farm for a while
The dad loadout tho
Exactly lol
i never bothered with grinding for a good BF. outlaw/rampage chattering bone is my go-to if I'm not using outbreak.
top tree titan with hallowfire heart and blast furnace/jotunn/outrageous fortune
Yeah chattering bone serves basically the same purpose
Though even my best best chattering bone has around half the range of my blast furnace
Thing's a laser
"I think they only drop from regular ba bounties so if you don't do those, there's no chance for them to drop. The only reason I would do ba bounties now are just for easier bounties to complete"
my loadout for everything has just been outbreak/recluse/outrageous fortune basically lol. sometimes i'll use loaded question or jotunn.
yeah i haven't done something BA related aside from forging 10 weapon frames for moments of triumph lol.
@Oathbreaker whats the best masterwork for hammerhead?
and is quickdraw rampage a good roll?
Range is likely one of the better rolls
*Maaaaybe* stability
i mean i can choose whichever i want
But reload is useless for PvP so
and which roll is the god roll?
"For Hammerhead? No, RNG on MW"
sorry i didnt quite understand
"^
You can't choose whichever MW you want, it's determined by RNG"
Thank you Trissin
I'm tired lol
oh yea i see that
i got reload speed rip
well regardless whats the best perk roll for hammerhead
"Anyways. In theory, this is best perks for each slot. Personal pick in italics.

Barrel: *Arrowhead Brake*, Fluted Barrel, Hammer Forged Rifling, Polygonal Rifling
Magazine: High Caliber Rounds or Appended Magazine (no personal favorite)
Perk 1: Dynamic Sway Reduction, *Quickdraw*, Tap The Trigger (DSR and TTT are great options too IMO)
Perk 2: Rampage or *Mulligan*
Preferred MW would be Range personally, though arguments could be made for Stability or Handling"
~~Perk 1~~ Magazine: not _ricochet_?
You mean for Mag?
"No, fucks with the FOV"
No that's just Rangefinder I think?
Let me test in a minute
i rolled full bore/ richochet/ quickdraw/ rampage
"Anyways, personally, Ricochet is *okay* but increased flinch for tilting opponents harder, or having a larger magazine for more rounds of pure tilt is better IMO"
please mark as spoiler!
@Teddy
all good all good
new armour set for shadowkeep
I really like the Titan set but not the helmet
lol thats what i said to the ps4 guys
that hunter helmet looks awful too
And the ||Warlock helm|| really looks like the one from ||last wish||
No decrease in FOV from RR
Must be thinking Rangefinder
"No I think you were right, RR slightly increases zoom @Oathbreaker"
i really like that warlock helmet
Just not by a lot
Just compared two screenshots with and without on a JQK3
"If it does, you're looking at like maybe 5% zoom increase at MOST"
Something that's real hard to see
Other than the ||spooky Astronaut armour|| none of the other sets released so far have looked particularly exciting to me honestly
The first one in this collection looks pretty cool : ||https://twitter.com/eclittlejohn/status/1168957647283994625||
god that warlock set in the first pic looks like ass
hahaha deadass.
Alright there are way too many Destiny trailers.
Can anyone help me find the ones where it shows Zavala and co. helping build the Wall and a child Amanda Holliday looking at a ship flying away?
https://youtu.be/xI5poBxV_-A
Ohh thanks
Best destiny trailer by far
It is *so good*!
"I didn't realize it was a D2 trailer, do we have origin stories for Ikora/Cayde?"
Unfortunately no
"I like the ""what is destiny 2"" trailer"
"Ooo i hadn't seen that one before, yeah it's a nice one"
Also found a semi-live-action trailer from D1 The Taken King
That had pretty good comedic timing
"As I said, so many trailers"
There is a live action one for D1 launch too
"I know the D2 launch live action one, hmm lemme see if I can find the D1"
https://youtu.be/ZSWN-VP0lD8
Ok that's the best one yet
They should Duncan Jones to make some Destiny Live action shorts
Here the reveal trailer https://youtu.be/gIp7vZuYzoA
The warlock throws a solar nade and then uses a nova bomb lol
"Oh man old russia looks so good, loved going there in the Thunderlord mission"
The patrol zones in D1 are better than D2 imo
Apart from the Dreaming City
Yeah Dreaming City and Titan are my fave zones in D2
"Wish they did more in Titan though, it's a bit under utilized"
Especially the arcology
Agreed I wish we had a raid or a dungeon on Titan
I just have bad memories of Titan after this last SoH
The never ending patrols were rough
That was definitely the worst one out of the three
I just fell back into the old faction rally route
Literally did 4 reckoning runs with 4 different sets of fireteams
the level of incompetency is unbelievable
"is exo stranger ever coming back, or are we just pretending that she was ~~nord~~ nonsense and never to be heard from again"
Do you mean the Exo stranger?
yes exo stranger my bad
i'm tired alright
Lol no worries
We got some stuff in warmind
yeah i missed warmind. i played seasons 1 and 2 and then came back for forsaken
and then i was gone again until opulence
i'll look into it later
i should go to bed. it's nearly 5am
"i've never played wow in my life except for the last week, and then my friends gave me a key for a free month of classic. now i don't sleep, and i blame them."
Riven Cheese might get a wee bit harder now
Also the super reduction feels harsh imo
Good
Sick and tired of PvP being super chaining
lol i bet 60% of players haven't done riven legit
or know how
Count me among those who never successfully finished legit Riven lol
"my attempts were an absolute nightmare, kept hitting the wrong eye during the final damage phase"
Been a long time since I have but I could do it.
Also some of the new armor sets are really good imo
Especially like the ||Phenotype Plasticity|| set
i love the titan
the shoulder guards are actual weapons now lol
Anyone feel like doing a raid or a nightfall or something tonight? I just finished Control and ready to get back to Destiny...
yea i need  to do a mars nightfall still
Does Opening shot on a sniper matter? I'm thinking since you one shot headshot anyway it might be a bit overkill
Stickier first shot
More forgiving headshots with Opening Shot
I have a nice Sole Survivor with Opening shot and I'm gonna try it out
"if you ever get a sniper with opening shot and firmly planted, slap a targetting adjusting on that shit along with some enhanced sniper rifle targetting if you're lucky enough to have that (i do)"
you're going to be shooting kitchen appliance sized hitboxes
its dumb

anything wiht opening shot though can be really forgiving
Omg LOL
Xur is selling Lord of Wolves this week
Lord of Memes?
In case anybody is still looking to acquire
Lord of Bullshit.
ANyone for some raids this weekend?
I really want the 1KV before the auto reload nerfs
anyone want to raid right now? lol
I can raid
im down rn or this weekend
Anyone for a quick 100K nightfall?
"Not sure if everyone is aware of this (posted in general chat), but there are now Title roles in our discord! You can head over to the #role-assign channel to pick up your badges and flaunt them in the server. :Cursebreaker:"
"I also want to take a second to apologize for being inactive lately, with solstice being over, Destiny being at a content low, and getting back to school, work, etc."
"However, with Shadowkeep dropping soon (less than a month!), I will likely getting back into the game, both for prep and also to do current content before it becomes deserted. I'll be around for nightfalls and raids this weekend, so if anyone needs a hand with anything let me know!"
I would like to request one one thousand voices and one anarchy please
i could probs do a 3x riven and one queenswalk tomorrow evening. if you want max chances at 1KV.
Yeah I'm super down for that
^ill help out with that too
"@Trissin not need to apologize, games in a bit of a lull now"
what time would you guys be available for LW tomorrow @Trissin @RonInDune . i'm usually able to get on around 9.
"Yeah 9 is fine with me, I'll be available most of the day"
cool.
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do 3x Riven and Queenswalk tomorrow evening for Ron's support network to get 1KV.
"Goal, your est, yeah?"
@Matos do you have 1KV yet?
I should be able to be available
"I don’t have it either. I’ll be available, but I’m only good for one run"
yes i'm' EST.
@RonInDune I don't have any raid exotics
"So I was watching some D1 nightfalls, and dragonfly feels like it worked slightly differently there?"
Firefly was the perk
Had a bigger radius
"Interesting, wonder why they changed it then"
Good question
so how many do we have for 3x Riven tonight?
1
"@thegoaliebear, @RonInDune, @Matos, @Trissin, and me is 5? i dont think we had a sixth"
anyone else then? @Destiny [PC] ^
"Also, is anyone available to do 6 forge runs back-to-back with me? I finally got a rare bounty from Black Armory and can move on with Izanagi's Burden quest if I can finish it"
wish i could haha.
@Thawxtem yeah I'm down later
Need to do a bunch for the ship anyway
"These are just dry runs of the forge. For the ship, you actually have to forge a frame."
When?
"Oh also for the Mars community challenge emblem, do we need a 100K run or will any run count?"
any mars nf run i believe.
nice then I'll do the overpowered arc singe wardcliffe run
"via TWAB from Sept. 5 just to be 100% sure aha:
```
Remember, to qualify for the exclusive Community Event emblem, you'll need to complete one Nightfall before next Tuesday at 10:00 AM Pacific```"
"Perfect, thanks!"
@RonInDune care to do a nightfall now before raids?
Ah give me 30 mins
When are we doing riven?
I'll be on around 8:45. so i can go whenever everyone is good.
About an hour or so from now?
works for me if others are good too.
So today is Destiny's 5 birthday!
How many of y'all were there since the beginning?
✋
Been around since the days of beta. First day it was active on Xbox 360 I had it downloaded and was playing.
Picked it up Day 1 and have played it for an ungodly amount of time since
I've only been around since year 2
Just a heads up that today is the last day to complete a nightfall for the Mars community challenge emblem
"I have a couple of Emblem of Synth codes remaining, does anyone want one?"
How do you have so many emblem codes Ron??
Lol I ordered the seal pins separately so I got a code for each
Plus I caved in and got the lanyard
"Oh, I see lol"
"I don't have the emblem of synth, but I think even if I did I probably wouldn't have it on very much. So I'll leave the offer to others, ty for your generosity ron!"
cheers!
"@RonInDune since there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest here, you could try the general chat?"
"I might do that, hope I'm not breaking any rules"
"Lol you're not breaking any rules, don't worry"
But I mean if nobody wants the emblems I wouldn't mind having it at all lol ;)
"yay, here you go"
Lool thanks Ron!
Finally got Khepri's sting!
All armour and collectible exotics acquired
Now just waiting for @Thawxtem to get Anarchy
haha nice.
"so depending how things look come holiday time, I might get SK digital deluxe on PC around that time and go pc as my main platform."
One of us. One of us.
"haha i thought it would be better to wait, but having my pc at college this year has been real easy given how much i already use it to do work."
I'm also getting sick of having to pay an extra $60 a year for online lol. i could use that to just get SK on pc 😩
BuT yOu GeT fReE* gAmEs
😂😂
none of which I've ever downloaded hahaha
There like a couple every so often that are worth getting 😂
the last one i downloaded was when BO3 was free as a promo for BO4
sometimes I'll download one just to have it in my library if i ever wanna check it out at some point tho.
Id pc more if I didn’t sit at a desk all day at work
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't season license supposed to transfer if you purchase them on your primary account? Or is that just undying?"
Shadowkeep doesn’t but seasons do
so i don't have to buy the digital deluxe on PC? i can just get the base?
oh. well...✌
The only reason would be if you super care about the deluxe edition items
I'd assume those licenses would be tied to the platform.
but with cross save I'd have them anyway from my ps4 account right lol
not that i care too much about them tho.
"so if I'm interpreting this correct, even if i only get the base SK on pc, I'll still be able to play the seasons included in the annual pass on pc since I've purchased in on ps4?"
That's what we know based on what bungie has said. By holiday time we'll know for sure though
"I know I have the limited edition stuff from vanilla unlocked, but I can't use it on pc"
that would be awesome if that turns out to be the case. I'll likely be switching then anyway but would be nice to only have to spend the extra $35 instead of another $60 lol.
"Oh for sure, I'm probably going to pick up the standard edition of shadowkeep on Ps4 unless there's some insane perks on that ghost shell"
I'm really tempted to just get the base sk on pc now tbh. that way i can download it all once it launches.
"i saw a post on reddit about like, what the preload process for pc would be and people who are switching the game to their HDD because it's so big haha."
"Youll be able to download it all when it launches anyway. I'd honestly wait, cause I don't think there's a way to upgrade to digital deluxe?"
I expect there will be some amount of time that bungie will allow people to preload new light before shadowkeep drops
yeah i want to see exactly how it works before i commit. i don't wanna get it now only to find out I'll actually have to pay again for the season pass later on.
Wait you have to pay 60$ to go online in consoles? Or is it a Destiny thing?
it's a console thing hahaha.
Playstation plus and Xbox gold are 10 bucks a month or 60 for a year
$60 for Playstation Plus. you get online access in  multiplayer games and access to extra deals and stuff on the PS Store.
"sometimes the deals can be really nice, but you just end up making those savings up anyway when you pay that 60 again haha."
Dang that seems kinda annoying. So if someone's playing an online game it's basically a +10 to the base price
I’m pretty sure if it’s f2p you don’t need ps+
Not really. Depends on how many online games you play
"That's correct, teddy"
yeah. don't need it for f2p. but as far as i know all the games i have that have multiplayer you need it.
I wonder if you’ll need ps+ for new light/shadowkeep?
ah so for something like PlanetSide 2 you won't need the extra price
"Right, but for cod, destiny, overwatch and other games like that you would"
also what other large f2p online console games are there? I'm assuming dota/league/starcraft etc. aren't on consoles
Fortnite
Apex
yeah I forgot those are completely free
Warframe
"Tera, ffxiv"
Ffxiv is free to start
"never played a final fantasy game, did like the spirits within movie though"
Man I should really get back into FFXIV
maybe I'll give it a shot
destiny kinda consumes my gaming life whenever there's a content drop
Ffxiv is a wow style mmo
"Teddy, you play on ps4?"
I played it on both
Did you need psplus for the ps4 version?
I had ps+
So I’m not sure
"It seems like it'd be silly to require ps+ for a subscription game, so I would hope not"
So I googled it you don’t need ps+ for ff
Well that's good
"Hmm this is interesting if true: 
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/destiny-2-crossplay-might-be-coming-sooner-than-you-think-1"
I wonder if there are any truly crossplay shooter games out there
Woah fortnite netcode seems to be super advanced
"Not a shooter, but I believe minecraft is also fully cross play now on the Bedrock edition?"
Twab is out and it's very interesting
Here's a link: http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48141
The weapon mod thing is kinda useful
Holy carp
"Oh man soooo many changes to exotics, you're right @Trissin this was very interesting"
"Yeah, I wonder what the meta is gonna be like"
Unfortunately I don't think scout rifles quite received the buff we hoped for @Matos
"I'm also very curious what the ||raid challenges|| are going to be, and what loot we get from it 👀"
hmm maybe complete the game ||blindfolded|| or using only ||Rock band drum sticks||
hope they change it. I'm sick of bounties for raid challenges and I'm sick of not getting individual emblems for them too lol.
"^^ yeah, emblems would be nice"
"Speaking of, I'd like to see the Garden Day 1 emblem"
@Trissin UUGGGHHHHH
"Also with SMGs buffed and recluse untouched, year 3 meta will be the same as year two"
Just as the year 2 meta was the same as the year 1 meta until pinnacle weapons
secretly hoping polaris lance is gonna be a top tier weapon since it refunds bullets to the mag
looks like the ||raid weapon is a quest|| which is fantastic
much better than nasty ass RNG.
I wonder how difficult it will be
I don't think something as important as the raid exotic should be easily obtainable
i agree
but it shouldn't be an RNG drop
I agree with that
I guess we'll see what the quest looks like
I'm sure Bungie has thought about this problem too
it should be as hard as Outbreak Prime and Touch of Malice was to get
"yeah the acrius and sleeper quests were fine, that should be their model"
I think ToM is a bit overboard
I felt that was a little bit much
How hard was touch of Malice?
"It wasn't hard, it was more just tedious"
You had to collect a bunch of calcified fragments
so was Outbreak if not more
Ah so lots of kills to get drops? Yeah that sounds annoying
Not kills
It's like collecting dead ghosts in d2
nah they were collectables
I remember grinding the mercury weapons were a bit boring
they are just hidden around
"Maybe that's just me, I don't really like searching and collecting stuff lol"
some were in the raid some were not
"I think i've filled like, maybe 20% of my lore triumphs"
that's probably an overestimate
i have every lore triumph
chronicler??
"damn, congrats"
chronicler and then some
we've got quite a few chroniclers here on the pc side as well
i'm not one of them
i did the dead ghost when i was bored one day
I have all lore tabs done as well I love doing them!
"I don't know, I guess i'm just not interested enough in the lore"
"Do you guys read the flavour text on armor, weapons, etc?"
All the time!
i dont.
i just wanted the tab completed
"I've looked at a few, but I rarely read through the whole thing"
lol @Arixama
nope lol
Although I know some of them are definitely very interesting. Are there any you particularly like @RonInDune ?
i read the lore books on my phone at work when im bored
oh hyeah hang on lemme lose this quickplay real quick
The Stolen Intelligence books are pretty good in following up on past stories and raids and stuff: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-stolen-intelligence
"The story of Orin, of the IX, is collected in two books: Dust and Ecdysis, both are just the right kind of mysterious"
"i did read all the ones that you get from thorn, lw, and lumina as well as all of the ones from drifter"
it basically just depends on how you aquire them for me
And one of my favourites is the story of Uldren (and Jolyon/Petra/Mara/everyone he loved) in The Forsaken Prince: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-the-forsaken-prince
which I think eveyrone gets just through the story
"A sad coda to this book can be found in the lore tab of Supremacy, the sniper rifle"
If you wanna know more about The Hive/Oryx read this https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/books-of-sorrow
"_Teddy, But a Blacksmith_?"
@Teddy that was collected in the Grimoire volume 1!
Gotta flex them titles
"It's fantastic and was written by Seth Dickinson, who's a great author"
I have the book
It’s dope
Yeah I can't wait for Volume 2
I didn't buy the comic collection cause I've been pretty hit or miss with graphic novels and don't want to waste more money lol
I literally forgot I preordered it lol
I was surprised when it came
oh man that was a good surprise
forsaken prince you have to collect
"damn, Microcenter has the R7 2700X for 189.99. i am TOO tempted."
*ONE OF US*
i don't *need* any upgrades rn. but i want them lmaooo.

my mom and i made a deal that if i get a full ride to grad school i'm going to microcenter and getting a CPU/GPU upgrade lol bless.

Get 'em if you need 'em
"Update to the TWAB posted yesterday: not sure if people have seen this, but minor enemies are getting buffed. This little bit was edited in ~ 2 hours after the TWAB release yesterday:"
might make full auto weapons be more useful
Makes minor spec a better mod
It depends on how much of a precision multiplier hit they take
Or weapons like huckleberry/bad juju for cleaning out big ad groups
oh true true
don't think i've ever actually used minor spec
"Also, how do I get rampage spec? I put in the one I have into my god roll blast furnace and I don't want to dismantle it"
Ada
ah thanks
If it ends up being quite a bit of precision damage lost then it might actually matter but I don't think it will
I believe 50%
"And then after that, extra precision damage will be dependent on weapon types"
I don't know if it'll affect most guns as much as people think
I could be wrong
"Yeah, it's not going to be huge - pretty sure most weapons that aren't full auto have been tuned to have enough bonus precision damage that they still one tap minors"
"But that's like, regular minors"
"I imagine high score nightfalls are gonna be a lot more difficult if midnight coup or austringer, etc. don't one tap redbars"
I mean all it takes is one damage buff or another
Imagine taking two shots to kill the infinite shadow thralls in whisper! 😱 😰
Wish we could put shaders on some exotic weapons
Is that two tailed fox?
"sorry, it was an ornament, not shader. and yes"
That sunshot looks so good!
Which one? Lol
bottom center ight
Those are some weird edits
The sunshot ornaments are pretty good anyway
That's just Red Dwarf turned blue
true true
"real quick- the time is fast approaching, and I was wondering where to look on Steam to make sure battle.net is properly connected for transfer"
"Can't find it on steam, but bungie.net tells you when you're logged in to your account"
bungie.net or battle.net?
Bungie.net
I'm pretty sure that's the bungie site
"I got it, thanks"
@Trissin @Arixama
From the subreddit with updated values. It's from a spreadsheet
Izanagis and stupid swords.
Might be time to skip shadowkeep before I have to equip a sword.
"I'm really excited to use Izanagi's more, I like that gun a lot"
And swords are gonna be really interesting lol
I wonder if we'll see any new exotic swords
"Worldline is more for the utility, I think, and I don't know too much about black talon, but I think it fires too slowly to be viable"
"If the new raid boss for Garden can be hit with melee swords, it might be worth it to put down a bubble and just slash away"
I'll keep it in mind lol
Speaking of Izanagi's anyone down for a heroic menagerie run this weekend?
I still have no idea what to main for shadowkeep. Nothing is jumping out at me.
Go middle arc hunter for a change and kill enemies by deflection only
Go for an orc paladin.
Or a lalafell pugilist.
I'd say Titan but I know you don't wanna be stuck on bubble
That wouldn't be the case within our clan but I fear it would be on any lfg
Hey @RonInDune if you have a spot you’re looking to fill I’d be interested in trying for that catalyst
And nobody should ever go lalafell >_>
Well that makes two of us!
if i had the AP...i always love doing heroic menagerie haha.
but i think they give the AP to forsaken owners for free come october 1.
"Think so, it’s confusing the way the season pass will work with cross save"
ap is given to forsake owners on tuesday
we were talking about it the other day and it seems like they're making it so season licenses transfer. so all you have to buy twice is the base SK expansion.
@Arixama WHAT.
*Shaxx voice* THIS IS AMAZING.
17th im pretty sure
"The seasons will transfer if you buy it on main I think, unless they fixed it, but yeah only buying the pass on one"
i would *love* if it was the 17th. i want to do the ap stuff on pc so badly.
And yeah looks like the 17tg
that's awesome.
i wonder how it will work when i start buying the stuff on pc only and stop using playatation tho. like i wish they had a complete account transfer of sorts ya know.
"honestly, if it ends up being if you buy on your main account season access transfers, itll just be better for you to buy the licenses on ps4 and play on pc"
If you buy on PS4 it’ll transfer since PS4 is your “main”
But if you buy on pc it’ll be pc only
"i think by the next big dlc release or game, the ps5 will be out and I'm not getting that haha. at least not soon after it launches."
it's just weird thinking about getting the stuff on pc for characters on a platform I'm not gonna play lol.
ill definitely be interested to see how they handle next gen stuff
"for sure. bc like...if I'm not getting the ps5, then will I still keep my characters? like how does that work specifically."
"I want a proper VR implementation too, once it's in steam"
Does Destiny work with PSVR at all?
i don't believe so.
bit of a shame
Destiny in VR would be pretty nutty haha.
Imagine how much a stompes hunter would make you sick
Too few games have done VR well still
Superhot/Deracine/Resident Evil come to mind
Imagine going through Shattered throne in VR
i feel like Destiny could be real disorienting in VR. especially when it comes to multiplayer stuff.
re7 is *ok* in vr
"it was stressful enough in normal, VR would've killed me"
the big issue is there are moments that are decently scary that become less so because of the way they have to build it in vr and you feel more disconnected to the character
"specifcally when you get your hand cut off in the beginning, your arms arent fully attached where they should be and so it doesnt actually *feel* like its your hand"
huh interesting
wonder if something like Amnesia or outlast would've worked better
did P.T. work in VR?
"also if you die to chainsaw mia and she cuts you in half, they just kind of fade the screen out instead of showing the chainsaw actually go up the middle"
i believe pt came out before psvr was a thing
"re7 is a very good game, and translates pretty well to vr, but because of some of the design choices that they had to make to make it acessible, its not as spooky as it could have been."
"doom vfr is a very good vr game, as well as farpoint and i expect you to die"
since i get the AP on tuesday i'd love to run some heroic menagerie if people want the izanagi's catalyst or just funsies.
I'm extremely down for that
I’d be down
I'm definitely down
awesome. which day works best for yall. i can be on any night by like 9:30ish EST.
I can make any day work around 6ish pst
"I’d love to, but I wanted to wait until I actually got izanagi’s burden. Stuck on waiting for Shattered Throne."
i'll make a post for it.
"If next week is high curse we can run you through it, forget what the curse is at now"
"@Thawxtem i mean, i'm down to do menagerie whenever tbh. so whenever you end up getting the gun i'm sure people will be available to do it."
@Thawxtem Plus heroic gives you the sword anyway
So we can do another run next week after st
@Crizum I don’t understand what you mean by ignore the current curse. It’s kinda important to unlock the dungeon.
I meant I forgot what the curse is at now
Mid
"Got it, so yeah if you see me around poke me and I’ll join up for it if you need someone"
Thanks but Ron and I agreed to two man it for the sake of Solstice armor masterwork
"So, I get off work at 9:30, give or take depending on if we’re busy. Would you guys mind waiting a little longer? If not I can do Heroic another time"
"i don't mind waiting a bit, but i have hard stops around 11 because of hockey schedule so can't wait around too much."
"Never mind, misread date"
it's just reset day aha.
May be able to try to get weapon beforehand after all. Maybe.
"Tried another 15-ish nodes today, still didn't get these two"
v v mad
lol i stopped after 33/40
I'm going to write a really mean letter to bungo over this one day
yeah that was a really frustrating chase. just decided it didn't really matter to me in the long run hahaha.
:(((( I know how you feel @RonInDune
Your emblem inspires me to never give up lol
How are you collecting your stems??
Patrols and lost sectors
I'm at 35/40
"What I did was speed run the lost sector in futurescape, killing ONLY the boss, and then letting the cursed thrall blow me up"
That respawns you at the entrance if you didn't clear the adds
And then you can leave and re enter
Oooh I'll try that
"Also be on the lookout for public events, they give you two stems"
good luck!!

Apparently it was the anniversary of Taken King recently! How hype was that launch?
I've seen a full raid playthrough and it was pretty freaking cool
It's when I started playing destiny. Still havent done kings fall or wrath of the machine 😂😭
Wrath was where the original outbreak prime came form right?
"They were both great, though Wrath had one encounter where you could really tell the engine for D1 was struggling"
haha I get it. engine. lol
"Yeah it was, kinda hoping Shadowkeep brings back Touch of Malice"
i'll show myself out
Wrath best raid.
touch of malice was TOO much for a quest. it was so...tedious and boring.
Imagining ToM in current sandbox well with Luna’s probably made Luke smith cry haha
What were the dominating weapons then?
like the equivalent of recluse/mountaintop
could you imagine tom with healing rifts and well
"Oh wait I forgot how it worked a second haha, it was last bullet leached life for damage right?"
Iirc Eyeasluna/Hawkmoon for hand cannons and some OP shotgun for awhile there
i don't remember the name of that shotgun but i don't want to.
Matador?
you literally got sniped across the map with it.
so kinda like Chaperone?
worse.
Matador 64 or Party Crasher+1
it was a dark time.
Eyasluna doesn't look that OP: https://destiny.fandom.com/wiki/Eyasluna
little do you know.
there was some god roll on it. that and Palindrome.
awful time.
innteresting
Wonder if we’ll get the mythoclast
I saw a Datto gameplay of the mythoclast just after it came out and it looked extremely op
I was getting emblems in Volundr forge and found these symbols that weren't mentioned. Any idea what they're for?
I *think* those were used to discover the codes found in the other forges
Is there a place where I can find all of these codes and get all the secrets in the different forges?
"I just don't know what to search for, I happened upon the emblems by accident"
"The 3 emblems from Volundr are all there is, other than Niobe labs"
You can follow this thread to see how people solved it: https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/a49zvw/black_armory_secrets_updated/
using those (and other) codes in and around Volundr
"For the hands you found, they have little dots over them that spell out Volundr in binary"
https://imgur.com/a/v8yUnFI
Anyone still need the Niobe labs puzzle? Comes with a ghost
Me and @Trissin got to level 7 a couple of times but couldn't finish
I think @Trissin ending up finishing it later
I've never even attempted it before...
"It's not hard, you have to stand on symbols and shoot other symbols with specific weapons"
And then kill enemies within a time limit
"Problem is, it gets a bit hectic"
everyone kept saying it's incredibly hard and stay away
"It used to be hard, it just now that we'v significantly outleveled the enemies and we have better weapons"
So it's not as annoying as before
alright. Any idea what time you were looking at @Crizum ?
I’ll be home in about two or so hours and can be around for the rest of the night
Yeah that sounds good for me
That makes 3
"Only requirements are Tatara Gaze, Spiteful Fang, and Hammerhead"
"I can do Tatara Gaze, I know the steps pretty well"
"But I think that’s between three people so missing one or two isn’t bad? I’ve never attempted it, just checking out a guide"
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/afamfo/niobe_labs_all_waves_completion_puzzle_guide/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body
"yo, sorry for late response"
yeah I did finish it with a couple people I found online
"even though we are overleveled and have good gear, it still gets really difficult"
level 7 requires everyone to be able to take out one of those big servitors on their own
That 1KV will come in clutch

So that means I should do the bow?
"Here @Thawxtem this is the best infographic:  you can practice the steps beforehand
https://imgur.com/a/qQjV9zI"

Yeah I went back and practiced it a bunch before starting the encounter
Got it wrong every single time
"ahh it's okay, if you give it a few tries you'll get it im sure"
"Hey Ron, anytime you get on, I would love some help with this ""practice."" I tried to read the info-graphics and towards the end it was slowly starting to make less sense."
"Alright I'm just leaving work, so I'll be on in an hour at most"
"alright, thanks. gives me time to eat beforehand"
Sorry guys my laptop overheated and shut down
Gimme a few minutes
Shadowkeep is officially only 2 weeks away! :shock: :travelergoogly: :mind_blown: :destiny: :zoomeyes: :Pickaxe: :1_:
@Destiny [PC] ^ 2 spots still open for heroic menagerie tonight.
Might be able to? I have class from 6-9 but it's a CAD lab which in theory should mean I'm done far sooner than 9
sweet.
"so with the new vidoc I'm wondering: as long as i don't delete my playstation account or unlink it from bungie, I will be able to keep those characters through cross save on PC even after next gen consoles come out?"
"just thinking in terms of Bungie seeming like they aren't going to release a new ""game"" any time soon."
"Everything is tied to the Bungie account, so you should be good to go there"
"Also lots of area spoilers in the ViDoc, be warmed"
"||The dungeon looks like something form Prince of Persia, I'm v hyped||"
"so um...now that I'm switching to PC, who knows if they'll be available for a day one raid attempt?"
"I might be in the same boat as oathbreaker, night classes, but we'll see if I'm able to get out early"
"Raids releases on a Saturday so I should be around, just let me know what class to focus on for leveling"
i have a game that day but it's in the afternoon. so i should be available from like 7:30pm EST onward. would love to get a group going for that to check it out.
Working that weekend sadly
So no can do for me
we got time haha. just would be good to get a team together that can stick together for a first clear as a clan.
When is reset?
1pm EST i think. or is it noon?
should it be like 40 min ago?
10 minutes from now I think
But there is maintenance today until 2 pst I think
10 minutes from now
annual pass
Just got on and looks fine. No maintenance or nothing
if only I didn't have class until 7:45 :(
Heck yeah hotfix
Oooooh nice
and it's the week to farm sole survivor too
Get that firing line
aw yeah
Hey does the official app ever show stats wrong? Cause it’s showing my triple tap firing line combo as outlaw snapshot sights >_>
Yeah my sole survivor with opening shot/4th time is my go to sniper
😮 that's the role we're looking for
I think API is down for maintainence
I have a beloved with no distractions/moving target that I'm not certain how good it is
"I'm fairly potato with every roll, so opening shot is essential for me lol"
I'm really bad with snipers in pvp as well
Only time I ever used a sniper in pvp was for IB quest
I still need like 100 sniper kills for revoker
only time i used snipers was for Revoker haha.
i have a Beloved with firmly planted/box breathing so...hard scoping for days lmao.
"https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48150

@Chronicler"
My greatest sniper kill was using whisper to one shot body shot  two golden guns from inside a well
Nothing will ever live up to that
"Bloody hell, ||Eris is taunting Savathûn to her face|| She's got some chutzpah"
Eris is a bad bitch that's why.
she's pretty pretty cool
Eris:
:BAha:
Is it wrong to want to see Eris and the Drifter interact?
eris would make the drifter cry.
she's too powerful.
Bet Eris knows the best way to season hive meat
"Eris' cultural impact:
⬛
⬛
⬛
⬛

The drifters impact:
_"
"This is a GOAT line, from ||Eris to Savathûn||"
hands were thrown.
"Even worse than Cayde's ""How's your sister?"" to Uldren IMO"
talking a pretty big game for someone who is gonna sic a god slaying mute at the problem like everyone else haha
That was Mara and Eris's plan the whole time lol
From https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/tyrannocide-v
I love the Tyrannocide lore pieces. They're *the bomb*
woah I didn't know you couldn't revive in the prestige modes of D1 raids
That's ridiculous
"Hahaha, yeah it’s why they have the token system now. Tons of fun"
Warlock self-res and grenade spamming Aetheon off a cliff was beautiful
hard mode raids in d1 elevated your game i think.
was it a fun mechanic? there'd be lots of waiting around
if someone died part way through an encounter you get really good at 5 manning and even 4 manning lots of stuff. one time in Wrath me and a guy two manned aksis phase 1 because everyone else died.
bloody hell
"I'm watching datto and company do all the raids in prestige, and it's interesting how similar VoG is to CoS"
yeah VoG is a lot of standing around waiting for things to happen lol.
also blue engrams drop legendaries for some reason??? wat
"Engrams could decrypt at higher levels, you could get exotics from purpled"
Purples*
??_??
"And you had to decrypt things, Rahool is a shadow of his former troll self"
"also they're sleepering themselves to death inside a bubble, I'm gonna try that in D2"
Hoping with weapons of light coming back they bring back the Glasshouse
Made weapons and armor of light last longer
oh that looks great!
i love when people who didn't play d1 discover great things about it haha.
this is so pure.
Honestly being in this clan makes me wish I had searched for an actual clan in d1
how was the LFG during D1? did the mobile client and everything else exist?
also the run through the darkness in Crota's End is amazing
I have no idea. Any LFG I did was handled by someone else
LFG in D1 was usually external sites like the 100.io or destinylfg.com as one example
There was a fireteams section on the Bungie forums but it was hit or miss at times
Reddit and mutual friends
or r/fireteams
yeah i used r/fireteams
huh shriekers had like kamikaze bombs after they died
destinylfg was full of kids lol
was discord up yet? lemme check
ok crota was Jan 2015 and discord was May of that year
I used Discord a few times back then on a few different servers
"Oh hey @RonInDune, look up Randal the vandal"
big yes ^
This guy? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUm6IQTeHGM
"In D1, also had a reference in wrath of the machines"
"Nah, OG Randal the Vandal"
Rahndal was his cousin
Considerably less beefy cousin
ok this is funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1LujNOkKSs
poor guy
Always hated that vandal for causing me trouble during the public event. Never realized it was a D1 meme
Wait is he aggressive?
you can see all the battle pass stuff now https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfTheUndying
i like that they confirm the season passes transfer over. battle pass seems neat tho.
Looks like if you buy the digital deluxe on one system and the normal version on another you’ll get silver?
i'm really not sure what that part meant lol.
"does it give you the silver value to ""purchase"" each season on whatever platform you don't have digital deluxe?"
Would be whichever version you log in to second
"Deluxe comes with the pass which is seasons 8-11, if you buy the normal on another system you get a season but since it’s going beyond season 11 they just give you silver"
Which I guess you could keep for future seasons
"that's...kind of weird ?? if the season pass transfers via cross save, then they're basically just giving us free currency lol."
but i won't complain haha.
"Yeah I think it’s just future proofing, if Shadowkeep is our last big expansion and seasons is how they’ll have content drops going forward"
makes sense. especially if seasons can be purchased with silver that will be really convenient. and also for those super tempted by EV exclusive stuff haha.
"so that cool Vex armor is from the battle pass, which i appreciate lol."
"As far as they've said, currently their aim is to do a shadowkeep sized expansion every year, with supporting seasons for the rest of that yeat"
They might wait for the next Console generation to really build a Destiny 3. Plus there might be other publishers in the offering
"Imagine if Apple buys back Bungie, going back to their origin"
was just about to mention that. i am curious to see how they will handle next gen consoles considering they're likely to release next year around holiday time.
"Destiny 3, exclusive to PS5 and Apple iPad"
you gotta love it
want to play online on iPad? just buy an Apple Music subscription for unlimited access!
want to hear audio? Buy the revolutionary and proprietary 300$ Apple iHeads
want to be able to download the game in the first place? buy an $800 SSD expansion!
"game has bugs? email Tim Cook directly and get a response ""you're holding it wrong"""
hahaha. jesus i really hate Apple 😂
"I liked their early devices far more than their modern ones! My 10 year old iPad 2 and 12 year old iPod Classic works fine, while a 2 year old Mac Pro is absolutely falling apart and 2 year old iphones have shite battery life"
They're absolutely cursed
macbooks are so incredibly overrated and overpriced i cannot believe lmao.
extremely agreed
Apple getting ready to push the self-destruct button for any iPhone less than the 10 now that they're releasing the 11 hahaha.
"""Planned obsolescence"""
lolol deadass.
i might be on closer to 9:45 for heroic menagerie btw. got some work i gotta finish.
So like 2-ish hours from now?
That sounds fine
https://tenor.com/view/excited-modernfamily-shake-fabulous-gif-4256378
when u see all that annual pass content available.
raid marathon time
yayaya
jk that assignment took way less time than i thought haha. i'm fine to play whenever people are ready.
im good to go whenever
Just eating real quick but good whenever
cool. do we have a full group for heroic?
@Oathbreaker you around?
oh for heroic
Sorry I've been doing QA work all day then CAD shit so didn't know if we had a full group
Yeah I can hang around for a bit
think we need one more still.
Did someone invoke me?
Fuck i should rebrand to that
hahaha.
Who are we joining up on?
I'm in orbit rn.
you can send a friend request if you want I'm goaliebear#1614
we are in raid channel.
@thegoaliebear I’m heading home if you guys still need a 6th
@Thawxtem perfect.
bring warlock or hunter.
Warlock. Subclass?
Well. have lunas and phoenix depending what the others wanna do aha.
I regularly hold both
perfect. we're gonna do the flawless strat with outbreak and swords for the boss but not going for flawless haha.
would anyone being willing to help me on the thorn mission
2 manning is hard
is that the Titan mission?
we were 2 manning just fine but bosses last phase is a struggle
"I am on that step as well; I can go later, but right now I'm doing heroic menagerie"
Alright Izanagi catalyst completed!
niceu
Narrative Preview Chapter 3 is out!
||https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48151||
Woah I didn't know they were making the annual pass free to all Forsaken owners
yes that's why i was able to do menagerie yesterday haha.
@thegoaliebear Welcome to the PC family!
thanks!💯
Hello everyone!
Thanks for the add btw
“Goal joins the battle”
yayaya🔥
Can someone from the pc group send an invite to LwMugetsu#1458
on blizzard or for the PC clan?
Yes ma'am
send join request for PC here: https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=2840602
anyone want to do a raid tomorrow night?
i don't have a preference lol. guess if people need a challenge or something that's cool too.
"I'm donw for any raid, would prefer some Scourge runs for anarchy though!"
Around what time?
scourge is good. i should be able to get on around 9:30ish EST.
"I’d be down, need that anarchy haha"
@Destiny [PC] ^ raid tomorrow night for those who want.
"I wish we could use icarus dash constantly, would make it so much more useful"
I will be on
@LW Mugetsu if you can do the raid tomorrow night add yourself to the lfg post.
My mouse may have just stopped working
Drivers are no longer being recognized by windows
"as a result any and all binds I've set on the mouse no longer work, except for the most basic of functions"
Tried to restart my computer about 3 times
No dice
testing on my laptop appears to have it working
yeah only happening on desktop
idk what's going on
:( what kind of mouse do you have?
I might be able to join depending on what time my classes end
@the_drake1997 i don't mind starting a little later if need be. don't have classes on fridays so i can be up later aha.
@RonInDune I’ll get Anarchy this time so you can get it next time
Every fingers crossed
G502
hm...did they release any driver updates for that mouse? but it's weird that it just stopped yet still worked with your laptop.
"Alright, this is just dumb. Figured it out. Logitech Gaming Software, the old software that worked fine until today has just shit the bed entirely. I now have to use GHUB and redo all my keybinds for every game I play."
I've checked the drivers on LGS. They're the newest release. Windows doesn't recognize the drivers anymore though.
"So annoying, Windows had gotten better about drivers lately, but there's no fixing some stuff I guess"
Alright it won’t let me join the event but I’m down for raid tomorrow. I have 0 clues as to what anarchy is though.
Thanks Ghost
anarchy is just the raid exotic @Pentan
The raid exotics are the only weapons I'm missing
Anarchy seems nice. Did a crown of sorrows with a guy that said if you have it equipped he’d kick you because he didn’t like cheese haha
That's wack
It saves so much time
"I could understand that mind set fo riven, but for crown it's a little silly."
"My mindset is this, if people don’t cheese how are others gonna feel morally superior?"
Lol he was probably mad because he doesn’t have it
“I got it and I immediately shared it” was his statement. Which means nothing cause collections hahaha
Sharded*
"He actually kicked like four people throughout that run for various things, that was the moment I thought “Yeah I should just find a clan...”"
i think it's silly when people hate raid strats lmao. like...sorry people don't always have time to do full runs.
"I’ll always be cool running raids with first timers, teaching/learning strats and roles but sometimes I only have 30 minutes and I want to stand in the Warlock puddle and pew pew"
"like obviously anyone's first time through a raid should learning it legit. but once you're good at it, it's totally fine to do an easier strat for time conservation and farming."
I've only ran last wish once the legit way and I was the leg person of the group.
The Xbox portion of the clan has a tough time getting raids together
"yeah I've been told haha. i mean, real life is a thing, and in those cases cheeses or easy strats are the best option."
for when you do end up getting something together.
"I have no problem doing raids either way, but cheese goes faster and there is less to remember"
exactly. i don't always wanna have to think about what I'm doing lol.
Lol. First time I did last wish all they told me was shoot the mouth not the eyes and don't die.
i love to hear that😂
"My first crown I asked mechanics, people said “doesn’t matter shoot crystals” and the only thing I heard was a dude shouting my name and “CRYSTALCRYSTALCRYSTAL”"
Still beat it but it wasn’t until a later run I had any idea of what was happening
i mean...they weren't wrong tho LOL
I still haven't run crown yet
“GET BLESSING” “wat”
crystals absolutely the most important thing. everything else you can sort of follow your partner around haha.
cuff them to your wrist😂
I think crown is super easy to learn if you're a first timer and you're paired with any experienced person. we can take you through it at some point @LW Mugetsu
Yeah it’s the easiest mechanics wise I feel
"Shoot your adds, shoot your crystals, swap with your partner"
yeah it's very procedural.
The only thing that can screw your run is if people are doo doo at add clear
for sure. if you're good at that then it's hella easy. sometimes I'd just be standing around waiting bc we killed everything so quick lol.
I'm pretty quick on picking up raid mechanics
"^^
A lot of people i've played with clear adds quickly and end up with nothing to do, so they'll rush to a different side to try and help out. Then, they get busy there and forget to come back to clear their own side's adds/crystal"
Those acolytes in the very last phase with the boomers are _strong_
yeahhh haha i ain't do that...handle ya own shit 😜😂😂😂
unless someone dies tho.
In all the other raids I had most of them down by my second time
"The one thing that guy in my run said that made sense was “I could drop you on Titan and you could find knights, if you’re having trouble killing them I can’t help you”"
Light levels not withstanding
"the thing i like about crown is because it's so procedural and partner dependent, it really forces you to get acquainted with all the jobs of the encounter."
"so like, you're not always put into one fixed role and then get confused when you're asked to do something else aha."
“Who is doing downstairs?” 6 people are silent and have no idea what that entails
I both like and dislike the idea that everybody has to carry their own weight and that you cant have just one or two people driving the whole encounter
Makes carries a little more difficult
"yeah that's what i like. some raids are super easy to carry like ""just go there and kill things"" but recently it's been getting more about everyone has to be on the same page."
Hopefully the Shadowkeep raid is last wish level
Size wise at least
Super excited for it
"It should be, yeah"
I hope today's twab reveals some details about it
I'd imagine it would be yeah.
"At least the entry requirements, day 1 rewards, etc"
And a trailer would be nice
one big raid followed by a couple smaller ones has been a good model tbh.
Like the raid lairs in the leviathian
Really want one of those jackets they give for first weekend clears
i wish i had the time to actually take a shot at day 1 or week 1 clears. i was hoping this could be the time but naturally i have a game the day tue raid launches lmao.
maybe if there's a raid for the spring season since I'm done with hockey by then😩🙌🙌
"Man that makes me want to do Eater again. It's a bit too small for a raid, but it is quite entertaining!"
Especially now that we have people who two manned it!
"I don't know if you're talking about me and Oath, but we havent two manned Argos. **yet**"
oh I though you finished it!
I saw you guys attempting it after finishing Calus
Did you ever try Kali?
This time we're going back with our secret weapon
Mountaintop
Aha
"We didn't try Kalli, no"
Maybe we will in the future
I'd actually really like to try gahlran too
hopefuly before the lunas nerf
I got some busy days ahead of me but we can do it
but we're both pretty busy now
yeah absolutely
You busy tomorrow?
I finish classes at around 7 ET
Hm
I work at 9am the next day
oh apparently Jotunn has a massive close range damage boost bug
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8BbjOk7SwE
apparently you can one shot dul incaru using the right combination of buffs and Jotunn now
Sweats in Gambit be like
@RonInDune i enjoy a celestial goldy to the face. but I'd like to try the jotunn thing haha.
If everyone in scourge has jotunns we could try it on prime?
i would like to see it.
"of all the weapons I've tried on Dul Incaru, jotunn is the last i'd have though would be viable lol"
i even one cycled her using outbreak
i love the fire toaster haha.
"it's my go to pvp loadout, blast furnace, jotunn and grenade launcher, while on a titan"
the dad loadout.
It’s not too viable but I love running recluse with peacekeepers
"I actually had some success running peackeepers and the Ikelos SMG, it does insane damage!"
You move so fast
"Also tried Tarrabah, but I couldn't get the perk to proc reliably"
"I dunno if it's a bug, but the Titan exotic armour that gives auto rifle ammo automatically sometimes weirds out with suros regime"
Wonder if with the buffs a Titan running Actium and Sweet Business will be good for damage
"i have no idea what role sweet business fits, it just seems bad in every situation"
"oh wait i understand the message now. i don't run 3 characters any more, so i won't be able to do all 3. i'll just sit this out unless you need someone for one run"
that's totally fine. seems like we'd need a 6th anyway. unless you don't want to do the boss x3 haha.
yeah that's what i'm saying lol. i'd rather not run it 3 times on just one character
i'm sure someone will be on that wants to
look at Buttkikker playing what is objectively and undeniably one of the best games
"I never could get into Terraria, the artwork just didn't suit me"
that would be something that stops you from enjoying it ron
I exclusively play games designed to frustrate and anger me which is why I play Destiny
you've obviously never played terraria in hardcore expert mode
"“My blood pressure is doing pretty good, time for some crucible”"
"I had enough toxicity in my life from DOTA 2, never again lol"
Hahaha did you see they are banning people for low social scores in dota?
honestly the Destiny community is so much nicer
"Nah, you just gotta embrace the fact that crucible is an unbalanced mess"
really? dang that was long overdue
"if you haven't noticed, i'm getting into wow now that this classic thing is out. never played it before, but i'm having fun"
"Yeah @RonInDune the community is pretty good, same with FFXIV which is the time sink I alternate with D2"
I though about trying FFXIV but 13$ a month feels too much
"so if anyone has 3 characters they want to run for anarchy farm tonight, feel free to join @Destiny [PC]"

😳😶😶
So Eris ||left to explore the stars before Oryx came into the system.||
I wonder who ||Mars was meeting in her throne room then||
what i decipher through the subtext is this: gay.
Oh yeah ||Mara is *super* gay||
||for literally everyone lol||
"every character is, if you really think about it."
She had a thing with Shaxx
The helmet stayed on
also with Sjur.
and Petra.
I like the tragic romance between ||Uldren and Jolyon||
she is a woman who gets what she wants😜
Imagine Shaxx shouting at you like he does in the crucible
i respect the hell out of it.
no.
😂
"the first thing that came to mind was ""*THIS IS AMAZING*"""
"“I tell everyone you’re my favorite, SO WHAT”"
and unfortunately i can't unthink that as much as i want to.
"I mean Shaxx is extremely Pan, remember he married *all of us*"
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-vow
shaxx is an lgbt ICON and we love to see it.
||https://twitter.com/lazesummerstone/status/1140498616030658561||
"i love the last part of that tho. ""someone screams."" like I relate yeah"
Remember the shirtless Shaxx cutout in Bungie's office in the ViDoc?
you love to see it.
"Mara annointing Petra as her wrath was iconic! 
I wish they'd make more cinematics or something, sigh..."
imagine a full cinematic of that.
or a comic about them. the *content* 👀
Can you imagine being any character in Destiny aside from your guardian? You are a super legendary wielder of the light who shoulders a huge burden  and here comes a group of 6 or so people who beat down everything that has ever given you trouble before dabbing over the corpses of gods and yeeting themselves with grenades
we love that for us.
Most characters honestly think of us as insane dancing children
And they aren't wrong
That lore piece about mad dancing guardians is great
i love when they put shit we do in canon lore.
The lore in Abide The Return sword references us as well: ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/abide-the-return||
Plus this hilarious Cabal report
just traded in some ps4 games for extra cash for steam gift cards so i can pre order shadowkeep on pc...only paid $20 for $40 worth of steam credit i love that for me.
24 hr emblem:
Contest is also going to active once again:
good.
would like to see the actual raid emblem tho haha.
i actually liked the regular crown emblem more than the day one emblem for it.
Regular completion emblem
:o I still think the day 1 crown emblem is the coolest
"this day 1 garden emblem is a little bit underwhelming, I feel"
okay...that regular emblem is way cooler LOL.
i love the color scheme.
"Here's the TWAB:

http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48163"
so I'm assuming after the steam migration happens when i log in on steam it will still be my ps4 guardians?
"Should be yeah, they’ll move your current pc characters but since PS4 is selected as main you’ll still have them"
"sick. i was just wondering if like, I would need to sign into ps4 or whatever lol. it doesn't seem like we need to re download the game then when the migration happens then? unless i missed something about it in there aha."
"They didn’t say, they’ll have info on preload next week"
Probably will have o download everything again on steam :/
nice. will still take less time than my ps4 will to download SK and then copy it tho haha.
I'm disappointed they didn't show off the jacket
Still gotta log in ps4 version to attach the season pass to my account
I’ll just download it while I’m at work and maybe it’ll be 50% copied when I get home
yeah...that's a pain. I wish I could have gotten a refund but...playstation store💀 I'm just leaving my ps4 on all day for that lol.
"@Crizum If you're talking about downloading the season pass, there won't be a download for that."
just so the licenses transfer i believe is what he meant.
The wording they used was something along the lines of “once you log in the season is tied to your account” so I at least need to log in once on PS4 before season 9 to get pass credit
Which is harder than you’d think once you get that first hit of pc gameplay
essentially it's just so the entitlements you have linked to owning digital deluxe (season pass) transfers via the cross save feature.
I'm still kinda surprised they didn't milk the hell out of that tho haha.
Oooh the 24 hour emblem looks very much like something from TRON
i really do think the crown one was a lot cooler though
I don't like the sotp day one emblem either
Maybe I'm just picky
as far as day 1 emblems go yeah it is.
I don't even remember what sotp day one looks like lol
yeah it does kinda look like Windows defragmenting
I'm just excited to go for another raid title. those are really the only ones I care about lol.
Let's work together
bet.
I'm ready haha
"Haha, I missed way out on riven slayer blacksmith and shadow so hopefully I can get whatever this new one is"
"I've got the flawless scourge, but I can't bring myself to finish 100 frames and collect 6 rare bounties"
omg the rare bounties more like exotic tbh
Reckoner/Blacksmith are known to be amongst the worst to complete
it's nice because shadow and enlightened are strictly pertaining to the Raids (menagerie in shadow case)
Shadow was by far the best one
blacksmith involved too much outside the raid for me to care lmao
I still gotta get me that shadow title
"For Rivensbane, some of the raid challenges are a bit overkill, plus the flawless is *hard*"
rivensbane was ass because of the 1KV RNG invloved.
All I need for Shadow are the 4 flawless triumphs
i had petras run completed 1.5 months before i got 1kv.
go for them @RonInDune !
Shadow imo is the epitome of a raid/endgame based title.
I liked shadow too
No need for tarrabah
yup.
And a fair amount of skill was required for the bosses
the ogre one took me a few tries
once the menagerie sword drop was guaranteed it basically eliminated a huge struggle with rng too.
I just need flawless and limited blessing challenge
go do the flawless with Ron! And Matos!
"so it really was made more into a team's skill rather than ""oh so you were lucky with your drops"""
"that reminds me, with the Jotunn bug it's possible go for solo flawless Shattered THrone this week"
"not saying Petra's was easy, but yeah"
but I'm always down to help with the flawless stuff.
*technically* I need the collections. But I got a lovely glitch where my collections triumph completed when I logged in on xbox
not sure how I feel about completing such challenges with cheese
The ST ogre (Vorgeth?) fight has been my nemesis for soooo long
Loool
"I've done everything solo flawless except for that, sigh"
keep trying! It took me a few attempts too
and God don't get booped off the wall after that because thats happened to me :))
That's when you alt-f4 on the way down
"Wait, does that work?"
I thought u couldn't leave in the midfle
For solo flawless
Can't even go rally for ammo
"No idea, but at that point there's nothing to lose anyway"
ah but taken armaments is pretty op here
"So we now have 2 pc admins, yeah?"
"not sure if I'm an admin anymore, lol"
I suppose we dont really need 2
you are an admin haha
"You are, that's why you have a yellow name 😂"
The other platforms have a least 3 I think.
the raid's in two hours yeah? hope I don't get flooded out again
i don't mind adding another pc admin or two. then you guys can get the admin channel👀
@RonInDune yeah around 9:30EST
"admin channel, oh man"
What nefarious plots are hatched in the admin channel?
it's GREAT
hot tea is what happens there.
i love that for us.
"as I suspected, mods are evil"
we have CONTENT.
but fr fr if you're interested in being a PC admin on Discord and love your tea piping hot lmk.
"hmm no thanks, I'm extremely liable to go mad with power"
yeah that's definitely you😜😂
https://tenor.com/view/galadriel-lotr-loveme-despair-allshallloveme-gif-5133799
impose your will on others.
force everyone to use rat king
not even that bad tbh
"Ooooh, I'd be in for that 😂"
"I'll join, I have the catalyst too lol"
@Oathbreaker can only use swords in all 3 slots
HAHA
***inhales***
"But it is your catalyst done, trissin"
nooo not even started
*REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
:reeeee:
Mines done. 😜
?!??????
Lol when did u finish??
My buddy and I farmed it out in whisper when his dropped 😂
"Not ever gonna bother getting Rat King, nor am I gonna bother getting Malfeasance 😤"
But the collectionsssss
*No*
isn't there supposed to be a malfeasance catalyst?
"Actually, aren't there supposed to be a whole bunch"
That we just haven't seen yet
i'm surprised i actually got malfeasance. used it for a hot minute.
"Doesn't matter, it's Malfeasance"
which means I could find a better gun in my vault that's known as Service Revolver that is only a Legendary
"i like how malf looks and feels, it's just a bit useless"
though i did almost kill roaming supers a bunch of times
almost being the operative word
I know my ps4 friends used to use malfeasance pretty regularly because they'd alway play together and would team shoot
if it takes multiple of you five or more shots to kill someone
Either get closer
Or you need to practice your aim a little more
No offense meant by the above statement
oh fully agreed
"That's the thing I love about destiny. Things may not be the best, but still viable in a lot of activities"
What am I being volunteered for?
i have no idea but we're doing scourge tonight with x3 at the boss and i believe Pentan only has one character so they don't want to run it 3 times if they'll only get loot once aha.
so if you want to join...there's a spot lol.
"Sure, when is that happening?"
930 EST.
Sure I'm down.
awesome sauce.
and base Shadowkeep pre-ordered for PC 🔥
Ari is now a PC admin? God help us all
https://tenor.com/view/star-wars-sheev-palpatine-unlimited-power-super-power-power-gif-5051810
He is a warlock main...
I can now only ever run tickle fingers. Sorry I don't make the rules. I have to do a destiny Sheev cosplay now
isn't like 2/3rds of the clan a warlock main?
"warlocks rule, hunters drool!"
We've got mostly locks and hunters yeah
Those are fighting words Ron..... You wanna take that into the Crucible and settle this?
"won't be able to make the run tonight, some buddies need help on FF14 > <"
"i was about to say, the ones that aren't warlock mains are the crucible boys"
Nah. We've got a decent amount of hunter mains. And a fair few switches too.
Buttkikker and I are trying to take down fargos mod masochist mode moonlord. This fight is brutal.
@Matos no worries.
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do scourge with boss phase two x3?
@LW Mugetsu we are in raid chat if you still want to do the raid runs.
@Nahkriin @Buttkikker i can barely handle moonlord on expert vanilla. i don't mess with modded terraria much but that sounds nuts
"He has cycling damage immunity, he can only take damage form one type of weapon at a time, we finally got him though."
"double nebula blaze, gg"
#mageMasterRace
oh you mean it's like the thing in destiny where it cycles on it's own
yeah thats rough
https://i.imgur.com/nz8pcS6.png
Are you guys 5 Manning?
"Nah, you got this!!"
I would help out but I'm still busy with some stuff on campus
"well we're doing x3 boss so if you happen to be available, six is always better aha."
Okay! I'll let you know
So you guys got him down once?
yeah we were with five people the whole time haha.
Pretty dang good.
"You guys are fucking dope. Congrats on admin @Arixama !!

Hopefully all goes well with getting and putting together my pc this weekend and I can try out the pc side of destiny. Would love to meet some of ya. I’ll still devote time to ps4, but gonna at least give it a whirl here"
for sure would love to have ya join in with some PC stuff.
"Since cross save I've actually been more active on the ps4 side honestly. That's definitely going to change with shadowkeep, but I intend to hop between both."
Cool. You liking pc? Seems like the clan on pc side of things is really revving up lately
yeah i mean overall everyone is in a bit of a lull while we wait for shadowkeep haha. but i've been enjoying the hell out of playing on pc now.
"Oh, I've been playing on pc since warmind. Started d2 on Ps4 back in vanilla and fell off cause everyone I played with fell off. Now I've got my real life destiny people here in the ps4 clan and some of us did all three leviathan raids a couple weeks ago so they could experience them."
oh I wouldn't mind doing some eater/spire runs soon
i enjoy EoW a lot but i don't want to give up my 69 clears LOL.
"I need to eventually run a prestige for the catalyst for that shotgun, and do EoW/SoS once armor 2.0 is out"
"Nice! I’m excited. I’ll prolly baby it with using controller still - my only recent kbm experience in the past 5 yrs has been csgo and that went poorly - and stick to pvp on console to start, but over time I may may the full jump. I started games way back in the day with doom and quake, so the roots are there just lost. My first real experience was ratchet and clank ps2.  But I digress..."
"i've been staying on controller honestly. been getting more used to kb+m when i'm just doing public events and strikes, but controller will definitely just feel way more natural for a while haha."
Seems about right. I cant wait for those load times tho. Or lack thereof
😲
and those crispy frame rates.
Yeeeeeeees pls
It really does when you first make the swap. I ran a controller for like 3 months on pc until whisper came out.
I still use a controller to drive tanks because that controls for tanks on key board are AWFUL
yeah it
rip*
Gotcha. Aight ill stop spamming and get some sleep. Gl with the raids over the weekend
haha it's fine. looking forward to seeing ya in the pc world soon enough.
"Now I know some people here aren't a fan of the epic game launcher, but they are handing out 6 batman games right now for free. The arkham trilogy and the 3 Lego batman games"
@thegoaliebear time to aim for 420 clears then
i'm a fan of that idea.
@Arixama I have so many games from Epic for free now that it'll soon approach my steam library size
Though the only games I actually play are Journey and Control
What’s Epic?
The Epic Games Launcher
(https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/)
Is it somehow linked to Steam?
It’s steams competition
"Lots of people are unhappy with how they are competing, which boils down to paying people to keep games off steam while offering the lowest amount of features they possibly can"
It's like steam at an early stage of evolution
"Wow, just heard of Epic and I already don’t want to use it"
Think Magikarp to Gyarados
They have some good exclusives though
Control is the best game I've played in many years
It's a better deal for game devs because they get more percentage of the sales
Yeah that's the only reason i support them
Even though Tim Sweeney seems to be a bit of a weirdo
not in a good way
UNLIMITED POWER
https://tenor.com/view/vegeta-dragon-ball-z-unlimited-power-over9000-power-level-gif-12316102
@Destiny [PC] ^ would love a 6th for tomorrow night. just finishing two boss checkpoints.
Don't purge me guys!
I'm still here!
CnC!!!!
noted 👍
just in time i was going through clan roster now haha.
Work just keeps me very busy right now!  If you ever need me for a raid or something Ari can ping me.
"same, havent played d2 in a while due to work/life shit"
It'll be a lot easier with new light boosting everything to 750
lmaooo.
Gooooooood
looooooooooooooooooool
"I did Levi dogs last night, got 72 spores with 5 people and honest to god one shot the dog with the toaster"
Oh hey Xûr's selling Orpheus Rigs with Traction and Karnsteins with Enhanced Grenade Launcher Loader
i will be on tonight if anyone wants to do anything at all. might just chill in some regular menagerie runs.
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48153
spicy.
I'm glad it actually give a decent reason for why we're getting the narrative previews not instead of the days leading up
See now I'm starting to wonder if Eris made another wish on her Ahamkara bone and effed something up
@Destiny [PC] I'll be on around 8 est tonight just doing regular menagerie if anyone wants to join.
Omg the grind is over ...
1998 glory
nice!💯
!! What happened?
I feel like I getting better at anger management
Dont know what happened but congrats!
I've been grinding for the recluse and i got enough points to get 2100 by reset
"Ooh, big congrats!"
basically been playing comp 2 weeks straight
if anyone needs comp help let me know
It only took me 2 days to get recluse
sounds like a weird flex but
i got super lucky with the group i joined for it.
@ovenjohnson still needs his recluse too
bloody hell man I'd take you up on that offer but I'm still trying to get good myself
"2.5 hours, 11 win streak, done...LOL. it was kinda surreal."
Oath gave me lots of tips
i think minimum games requires is 16? assuming you win 16 in a row
I got to like 10 before i lost one
thats the dream right there tho
16 win streak
i was at like 1000 when i started it.
I'm around 1300 right now after a whole season of grinding
16 streak will net you Fabled.
i haven't touched any form of pvp since i got it lmao.
The worst part about getting fabled is the minute you do your opponents go from seal team 6 to a bunch of potatoes
and you'll run into a bunch of recluses and other cancer in comp
yeah it's annoying to run into recluse/mountaintop combos way before reaching fabled
atleast the number of not forgotten/lunas have dropped off completely
but the number of spare rations have skyrocketed
"Because they applied a console nerf to pc haha, and now that it’s not Luna’s it’s SR, and if that gets nerfed it’s Bygones"
"That's what happens when you gut a gun, sorry to say that but it's exactly that."
Something will always be meta and that meta will always be the worst
lets just hope we dont get a clever dragon meta in shadowkeep
"i havent played Destiny 1, but I keep seeing videos about it due to the pulse rifle buffs"
"The damage increase for pulses aren't enough for that, IMO."
Erentil with rangefinder firmly planted
I'm waiting for Graviton Lance to become stupidly op again
Just ban shotgun apes
Also they should try to find some way to make sidearms viable
Increase range by about 3m before dropoff begins
"Within intended ranges, Sidearms aren't bad."
"Did a 1v1 against someone. No HUD, the Gambit Prime Sidearm, and an Aachen sniper. Pulled a We Ran. If I got a bodyshot, I'd push hard and spam Lonesome for the cleanup."
"They felt okay, not great. If they increase the range by about 3m it'll do it."
Crizum said erentil and i immediately thought of @Oathbreaker loool
Why's that lol
Cuz your roll is nasty
Different roll but yeah
Thing maps
Stupid tropical storm knocked out my internet.
today @Thawxtem almost managed a flawless run of ST
All 21 deaths came at Dul Incaru
aah so close!!
"i'm sort of filling in for my supervisor at work right now and if they like me they'll promote me (assuming the position is open, it's complicated and i don't have all the information). because of that, my schedule's a little wonky. basically i'll only be able to play on thursdays fridays and sundays until further notice. sorry, can't fill for scourge tomorrow night"
how do i know if shattered throne is up this week
need it for izanagi
"It's up every 3 weeks, specifically whenever Petra is in Rheasilvia"
Me and Thawxterm ran it today
yeah i know its every 3 weeks just wasn't how to tell because I havent been keeping track
do we have a 6th for tonight?
bc if we don't have one for sure I'm not gonna get on. i have a game tomorrow so can't stay up waiting around for someone.
I got work and a boatload of differential calculus alongside quality assurance work. No can do for me.
yeah lol i have a ton of work to get done for next week so. it's cool tho. we have the checkpoints until tuesday reset.
Is it just 3x insurrection? I don't mind helping out
Yeah no worries we'll get it whenever people are free
"that should be like, what, half an hour?"
maybe a bit longer
It's actually 2x
only 2 yeah aha.
We finished one
"oh, nicee"
if we have 6 for sure then i don't mind hopping on.
I'm actually at home tonight lol so I'll be able to help out if ya need me
Oh then I'll be on within 30 mins
Let's get this bread!
yeah looks like it haha. i can be on around 9. the earlier we start the better.
I’m just doing strikes for wendigo so I’m good to go whenever
I can be on whenever
"If it's cool with thawx and mugestu, we might be able to start half an hour early it seems"
@Thawxtem @LW Mugetsu ^ you guys available to start around 9?
My internet is still down. Tree limb took out the line.
oof. do you think you'll be on tonight at all?
Not likely
"i mean, we could still 5 man it if necessary, but always better with everyone."
Yeah I'm not happy about it. Can't get anyone out until Monday afternoon.
that's rough as hell. but hope it gets fixed then.
we can still 5 man it.
I can join as 6th if you still need one
that would be great.
9 pm thats in 15 min right?
"Sorry, I was eating. I can do 9. (I think it’s a different time zone, so I’ll ask: that’s about 15 minutes, yes?)"
to both lol
"i'm curious, what FOV do you guys play at?"
110 I think
okay. i've worked up to 105...think that's where i'll stay at aha.
It can go higher than 105??
105 is max
wait
"are armor mods also going to become ""unlocked""? or just weapon mods"
"basically, should I be dismantling my armor mods"
I think armour mods won't be useful for armour 2.0
idk i've just been holding onto all my mods until i see exactly how it works lol.
I think you should dismantle weapon mods
for free mod components
"All I'll dismantle are the weapon mods, rest can wait"
I think keep 1 of each or something
"Save one of each weapon mod, don’t need to save armor I think"
ah I see
so I can go ahead and dismantle armor mods then
Here is the list of all the weapon mods in the game if you think your missing something
Anyone looking to run crown of sorrows?
"Can, helping with Izanagi but free after"
always down for a raid but tonight i'm headed off early.
"if you want, we have an lfg post maker that you can use to set up a raid for any time you're available. we usually use it to organize stuff in advance."
cool ill check that out
the command for it is `!lfg create`
is anyone in here on the lock and key part of the izanagi quest
the special pyramidion mission
...we just did it...
ZZZZZZZZZZ
i just did my shattered throne
and _it requires everyone in the fireteam to have it_
REEE
i actually ended up finding others on the same step in LFG we did it
now i just gotta upgrade my chalice
https://tenor.com/view/saturday-night-live-maya-rudolph-uh-uh-no-no-way-gif-3735378
my 5 page essay when i wanna play destiny
"Hey guys, I wanted to post this instead of being silent with this whole thing:

Got an invite to a clan that a number of my buddies are in, and after some deliberation I've decided to join. That being said, I fully intend on staying in the server and if you guys need a body and I'm available I can jump in. Made a hell of a lot of memories with you all in the past year or so, and you've all been great. Like I said, I'm not intending on going anywhere but I wish you all nothing but the best ❤"
"You all are some wonderful people, don't ever forget that."
@Destiny [PC] who would like to do a Crown run or Scourge anarchy farm on tuesday night? usual 9-9:30 EST start time.
What's that 7 Central?
8.
"i'm only good for sunday, thursday and friday nights now"
i could do thursday night too.
I might be in class. But if I'm not I'm definitely down! Put me as a maybe
"cool. i'll make an lfg post for it. you can add yourself as an alt if you're not sure, but i'll make it for 9:30 EST."
"wait, which raid do you guys prefer LOL."
I'm definitely down!
"Oh man, if I say crown does it just look like I got anarchy and dipped on scourge?"
"hahaha nah i don't care which one. if it's crown i'll only have time for the one run, but obvs if people wanna do scourge we'd grab the boss phase 2 check points."
I'd probably be down for a raid gotta double check when some assignments are due
"sweet. well, i'll make it for Crown, but if people end up wanting to do Scourge when the time comes i'm cool with that too."
if im a maybe do i hit the question mark?
if ya'll dont mind giving me the low down on encounter i'd like to join been through once b4
for sure.
"As soon as I know my line is fix and my connection is up and running I'd be down, but I won't know that until tomorrow afternoon."
Can't jump in as an alt... Something about platform conflict
hmm...weird.
"Ok fam. What's the play since I now have a pc (yay!) and have enabled cross save? I heard about releasing something for free in the past week or so, but what content do I need to buy on pc? Also, should I just wait for shadowkeep to get a better deal? For instance, if I have all but played out all the content of forsaken and expansions on ps4, then should I just wait til shadowkeep launch to get d2 on steam and roll out then? Will I still need to purchase old content if I want to seamlessly do activities from forsaken?"
you will still need to purchase forsaken on pc if you want to do stuff from it on pc.
the annual pass of forsaken was given for free last week. but you will have to wait until oct 1 when the steam migration happens to buy it now because everything was taken off the blizzard store.
"season pass licenses transfer now tho. you would still have to buy base shadowkeep on both platforms you want to play it on, but you would only need to get seasons on your active character account to transfer the license."
"so i would just wait until Oct 1. vanilla + y1 will be free to play, you won't have to spend too much of forsaken+AP, and then you can just get base shadowkeep on pc. we have to redownload the game anyway bc of the steam migration so you can wait to see where you want to store the game too."
@Destiny [PC] i'll be on tonight doing regular menagerie runs. just chilling. if anyone would like to join lmk.
"so apparently SKyburner's Oath has infinite range: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky4WUuKFTw0"
oh I saw that video earlier today
it made me regret doing the catalyst
That's going to be my secret recipe to get to Fabled
don't use Skyburners
TTK is awful
better to use even a No Feelings with Box Breathing
There's a misunderstanding here
"The opponents will see Ron having equipped a skyburner's oath, and think to themselves ""oh man, he's putting a handicap on himself, there's no way we can match against him!"" and then leave the game"
Exactly
It's a psychological trick
which raid would you guys prefer tonight?
also Shadowkeep official launch trailer in one minute.
One week left!
hell yeah!
"So I should be home by that time tonight,and I've definitely been missing destiny"
looks like pretty good stuff. looking forward to raid and endgame most tho like usual.
@Arixama and we have missed you😩
"Fun fact, rural Nebraska has like no data coverage for me"
"I 100 percent was going to hop in on that 3 x scourge the other night, but I ended up getting home like 20 minutes after you guys stopped."
you were with us in spirit
that's why two people got anarchy
"I think since we have 2 people who aren't as familiar with the raids, scourge might be a bit easier to do and can also do anarchy farm again."
I smashed my face against Iron banner last night and it was fucking awful. Definitely would be down to do either one
Still love that we got two anarchy drops and they went to Criz and Crizum
Gotta start doubling up on other names for drops
love that for you.
"It'll be great once we hit steam and can change our names at will. Full raid team of ""Anarchy plz bungo"""
"i feel exposed without ""the"" in front of my tag on blizzard lol."
steam brings me back to greatness.
So people are saying this looks like trials armour?
Those are 100 percent the gloves
I will need a trials carry plz
looks like it. i really like the hunter set so would be nice if i could use that again.
use my flawless ornaments on it😩😩😩
the hunter boots make my guardian thicc as hell.
As a Titan you gotta try real hard to not be dummy thicc
"Less so now, but year 1 was bad"
I want to titan cosplay Big hero 6 again
I expect they'll bring back the trails armor in a different activity honestly
Time for spire
Maybe part of menagerie?
@RonInDune slap a white shader on that chonky boi.
Glowhoo better come back
Not menagerie for sure. Hopefully we'll get more nine story
Just a disgusting neon chonk running at you full speed
if they bring back trials armor maybe tie it to a glory rank or something.
I'd say that's probably likely. Since *in theory* they're making glory easier with the 3v3 and solo queues
"""pinnacle crucible gear"" honestly it's not a bad idea."
should make a pinnacle vanguard set too. that would be neat.
It’s a terrible idea unless you work for a boosting service lol
I think the changes will help a bit.
The worst part of crucible is how garbage it is before 2100 and how sweaty quickplay is
3v3 is more like d1 trials anyway.
After 2100 was the best games I played this season cause people weren’t getting streamer boosted
"Honestly, pinnacle armor is a fantastic idea since it will mostly be cosmetic anyway"
That chest is defo the trials warlock set
^^ to both haha.
"I suppose, I wouldn’t be against something like armor for valor and glows for glory kind of a thing"
"Pinnacle ornaments would be perfect, actually"
a pinnacle armor set for each would be great. tie it to the pinnacle weapon quest. even more reward for efforts.
Just watch them tie an OP mod to legend glory
🙄 I wouldn't doubt it lmao
“Auto reload your grenade launcher on grenade kills”
GG mountaintop one eyed
Grenade launcher kills*
nah next they'll have like the jade rabbit catalyst at legend
"They won't. If they were going to do that, they would have already since the mida catalyst is there."
Jade rabbit is already in I thought?
"but the thing is that the pvp population falls to shit again once people are done getting the pinnacle stuff. and if you barely play pvp anyway, it really doesn't affect you."
Yeah it is I have it what am I asking lol
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1176542109916004352?s=09
Sounds like they gotta make the game fun
If people are playing PvP just to get the best weapons and immediately drop out of PvP they gotta do something to make it worth playing aside from “make the weapon grind longer”
I know some people don’t want to get sweaty in quickplay so they keep skill based matching out of it but that’s only fun for people who stomp
So the bottom tier drops out and doesn’t care to get better because why bother
So people who don't enjoy pvp are playing pvp for their weapons to use in pve since they're good weapons
exactly. and that will always be the issue. pvp is incredibly unforgiving especially to newer players who never have the chance or time to get those pinnacle weapons. because the only people who stay in QP are the sweats who feel like they're special stomping on others with all their pinnacle pvp weapons lol.
I think Recluse and Revoker were fine in their quest design tho.
"They were, MT was terrible because it reinforced bad habits"
but again...i haven't touched pvp for months after i got recluse. so the longevity factor isn't there at all really.
Just saying for me the least sweaty matches shouldn’t be locked between fabled and mythic glory lol
but i agree with MT being awful. i just never bothered with it bc i 1. hate pvp and 2. couldn't willingly play awful just to get a gun I know I'd barely use.
Revoker was probably the best because you could just gain and lose glory and eventually you’d get the number you needed
yeah. 3500 is a solid amount but with no loss penalty it didn't feel as discouraging.
Problem is mt is amazing damage in the current sandbox 😦
"The only reason I'm even getting it I cause I jokingly asked my buddy if he'd get it for me and he was like ""get me these specific perks and I will"""
"GLs are great in general. and with all the weapon buffs and changes coming, i think a wide variety of loadouts are going to be seen."
I like being able to roll with different stuff that can aid a bunch of play styles. so I'm excited for the changes.
yeah towards the end of the wendigo quest I really started to enjoy fighting lion
"it's a complete different method of fighting, but even more interesting"
i happen to love the black armory auto rifle. so with the buffs coming in going to try farming out a good roll on it.
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1176542833613783041
blessed.
"I'm excited to be able to look the way I want, and be able to change perks on the fly. Plus, the infinite power level up will be great because it'll make it easier to help inexperienced raiders complete encounters easier"
Get preloading PC bros
PRELOAD
PREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELOAD
ALRIGHT LETS DOUBLE OUR DESTINY DISK SPACE BOIS
WORTH IT
ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT
i think I'm gonna move it to my SSD. get some of my now less played games onto my HDD instead.
So like we at 300 gigs?
It’s 80GB apparently
the entire game?
not bad at all. SSD it is for me then.
It’s gonna need double that to unpack tho
yeah i have plenty of space. this is the only game i keep on my SSD.
I wish I could add one more SSD to my laptop
i still have like 490GB free on my ssd haha. not an issue.
bloody hell lol
this laptop came with a 256 gig SSD and that's all I'm stuck with
i just went with a 512GB SSD for D2 and OS. plenty of space and then a 2TB HDD for other games and files.
Thinking I want to put another ssd in my system but I didn’t build it so I don’t want to screw anything up haha
Technically I think you could make an image and clone it on to a new bigger ssd @RonInDune
"Yeah I might en dup doing that eventually, I just don't like messing around with the primary drive"
Or once I've settled down I'll build a proper desktop
Anybody not have shadowkeep preordered on pc try downloading it?
Did they release the Mars community challenge emblem yet?
nope. no word on it either lol.
hmmmmm
I think I get my code on Saturday?
Nice! Does the deluxe edition come with a disc?
Not on pc for sure.
Also since we're talking about steam stuff
My steam is filled with troll games my friends bought me haha
i just have base shadowkeep preordered on steam so when i go to preload will it still do the whole game along with the Shadowkeep?
"Yes, because of newlight"
I think the way Destiny works is you download everything but they just gate you out of what you don’t have
Yeah according to Bungie this is everything
For fun if you have any of the PS4 exclusive stuff log on and equip it and switch to pc
i wish steam migration was today haha
"Same, but I'm also glad its not for various reasons as well"
"I like the new steam library, looks so much more modern"
I do wish they had dropped the new armor system today though. Like they did with the weapon system last year
"It's Mayhem this week, in case anyone still needs to grind mountaintop"
Plus Valor and infamy boosts
I'm gonna get Fabled this week even if it kills me
What are you at now?
Like 1500 or so
i can't wait to get rid of the blizzard launcher next week.
im not going to do crown tonight so im going to take myself off
Trials armor in the trailer confirmed a mistake
love that.
At least they're not keeping silent about it.
Seems like we're definitely off to a good start as far as communication goes
"well the last of us trailer looked good, if a bit violent"
watching the destiny trailer and then tLoU makes me appreciate the artstyle even more
Last of us is definitely a violent game 😂😂
Yeah it's more Mortal Kombat than Uncharted that's for sure
"i love the story in TLOU. i don't see myself buying it lol, but i'll definitely watch streams of it. love Ellie so much."
Ellie does look like she's sure seen some shit
She for sure has
I thought TLoU would be a PS5 launch title
I don't know if you've seen the first game
Enhanced edition will be
I hve seen bits and pieces of playthroughs
Loved the giraffe scene
yeah that girl is hella traumatized.
"I still need to actually play through the dlc. Seen it played, just didn't ay through it."
"Hey everyone - Not sure if this is where I should post something like this, but I was wondering if anyone was looking for a couple of players to do the new raid on Oct 5th when it comes out. Me and Spitfire2266 are looking for a first day raid group. Let me know if anyone would like us in their group. Me and spitfire are quite new to this clan."
yes we will get a group together.
i can't get on until at least 8pm EST that night since i have a game. so we'll likely shoot for that time to start learning it.
I’d for sure be down assuming I can reach a decent light level
decent enough to do the first encounter is always my goal hahaha.
i should have the 4-6 off if all goes to plan!
"i dont know for sure what my work schedule will be, but ill probably be on around  then too"
but the good thing about getting a group for a day one learning is we can continue to learn together until we complete it. so knowing you have people to do it with is always nice.
but i will make an lfg post for it maybe next tuesday so people can see what their schedule might look like better then.
It’s a Saturday correct?
"Cool, off saturdays for the time being"
"i am glad because we have Sundays off, so i can stay up as late as people want to go haha."
"but it looks like we might have enough interest to even get two groups going, which is awesome."
sounds great!
I should have that entire weekend avaiable as well
available*
gonna be hard to keep away from twitch always used to watching the worlds first race but wanna get into the raid completely blind
"i always watch streams, but given that my game takes up my entire day i will likely be going into this mostly blind."
i usually like figuring stuff out first time into it and then when worlds first clear happens I'll look through a guide once they post what they did lol.
I found out quick watching some of the better streamers solve the raid is way more interesting than me banging my head into it
"yeah. i think i have like a one hour tolerance of going in blind before I'm like ""fuck it what did they do"" lol."
i wish i had the time to actually figure out a raid totally blind but...having time. imagine. LOL.
Ok so
What do? No forsaken memes.
The Forsaken stuff will be added at a later date
did you already get the deluxe on ps4?
forsaken?
i have not purchased shadowkeep anywhere yet
are you planning on sticking on ps4?
im gonna do both
"your primary account is ps4 based, yeah?"
"Only need deluxe on one, buy it on whatever your main account is"
ok so you're saying buy the $60 on ps4.....then free to play on pc? or still need to pay 35 on pc additionally?
still pay 35 on pc
ahhh. that's whack
"You will still need to buy Shadowkeep, and eventually Forsaken if you want to play any of that stuff, on pc"
you still need base SK on PC. but the season pass will transfer from deluxe version on PS4.
"season passes will transfer, shadowkeep stuff wont"
i c
will we have a 6th for tonight? I'm feeling pretty tired so i think i would be cool doing scourge and grabbing checkpoints.
Yeah I'm down for some scourge checkpoints
When are we starting it again?
9:30ish. so in about 45 mins if that's good.
Good for me. Running comp on Ps4 so I may be slightly late depending on match timing
that is perfect
So suddenly I *may* not be able to raid
Big storm just hit and my friends a cross town lost lower
Power
hope your power stays up haha.
https://www.shacknews.com/article/113196/how-to-fix-update-stuck-on-initializing-in-destiny-2
"Earlier you guys asked about which platform I plan to be my main.....if I buy the digital deluxe on ps4 and play on pc, I'm still earning everything for the season at the same rate right?"
"yup its the same characters, they just become playable on other platforms with cross save"
"ok, so technically that doesn't matter which system i buy the deluxe so long as the other I just get normal. Idk why I'm being so thorough about this here, but I'm that kinda person i guess"
that's what I thought @Arixama
So the reason for buying the deluxe on main was a tweet that basically said any seasons you bought will transfer as long as you bought them on whatever your “home” platform is
you need to buy the deluxe on whatever your active character's account is.
"so if you want to play everything on both platforms from now on, and your active characters you have activated for cross save are on PS4, then you need to buy any season passes on the PS4."
ohhhh but wait why would i rebuy forsaken then? im confused
because you still need the base licenses for that expansion on PC.
"Think of it this way, seasons will be be fluid and work wherever, September releases (Forsaken, Shadowkeep) require separate purchases to license"
"^ yup. so, the base expansions are separate add ons to the game, but the seasons are just updates essentially."
❤
"ok, so i was just reading through this...trying to figure it out...so i brought my characters from PS4 and bought the deluxe on steam. so does that mean in playstation i will have nothing?"
"You won’t have Shadowkeep on PS4 if you don’t buy it, you may have access to seasons"
and if i bought the deluxe on PS4 then i would have it here too
"sorry, i know yall just went over this with Obsolete, just clarifying for my behalf"
"Bungie's communication skills could be better in this subject, especially given they recently introduced crossplay"
"Hey, is there a reason that there is hardly anyone on my clan list in destiny? i only see two people..."
It's late at night
it's late and also are you still in the ps4 clan and were you playing on PC at that time? @the_drake1997
"because if you are, even if you're playing on PC your active clan is still linked to whichever clan you're in for that set of characters. so if you're in the PS4 clan and you're playing on PC, you will only see people from the PS4 clan who have recently played on PC as well."
"Oooh got ya, thanks"
"It was just like two people and they said offline, that's why I was curious lol"
"how i felt last night IYKYK

"Man except for a few, most of these example are pretty ugly: https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1176929207772839936"
lmao yeah.
I still think @Arixama has the best fashion sense in our clan so far
This is the best one: https://twitter.com/shackleshotgun/status/1176931772199841792
that is sick.
what cloak is that?
i like my build
the amethyst veil shader makes it look even better bc now it's all black.
"Season 5 iron banner cloak, according to the comments"
"Oooh  goal that is pretty fly, looks like Ghost from the 2nd Ant-Man movie"
that is actually the kind of look I was going for!
the black and grey shaders go best especially bc the purple jewels on the chest are fixed color.
but I'm glad the gold from the scourge gloves and lw helmet matches LOL. nothing worse than off shades of gold.
The Wings of Sacred Dawn ornament (midnight sun) kinda does that black/white theme pretty well too
idk if you saw in that thread but there was a Michelin man chonky boi hahaha
the all white eater set.
it's hilarious.
It looks amazing
watch out for that look on the next New York Fashion Week
"This'll be my next set, just gotta find a better helmet:"
I like that.
this is mine from year one
oh that's dope
this was my warlock in CoO. mars set + sunbracers + golden trace shader.
the mars chest from warmind is SO GOOD
i definitely plan on going back to the mars set for my warlock once armor 2.0 is out. it really is a great set.
put metro shift on that shit and its gorgeous
y1 titan:
oh heck it's thor
ok how the fuck did you get those screenshots
I can't wait for armor 2.0 so I can get these builds back LOL
theyre fantastic
it was when you could replay the missions in the edz or something.
OH so its the solar subclass mission?
OH when you unlocked the subclass yeah. that mission.
wish we could replay those missions
"its real easy, just delete a character and start again /s"
I'm defo getting this hunter armour back when SK is out
"I just realized, levelling up secondary characters will be bit of a slog won't it"
I always replayed missions with cut scenes. especially in d1. these are some of my favorite shots of my hunter:
that cloak was great! Do we have anything similar now?
nope hahaha :')
😿
the glow on the garden of salvation cloak is about as close as we'll come.
ornamemted Kings Fall set tho😍😍😍
oh man that looks spooooky
i want the taken armor sets back.
YEAH
I wish we could run the tincture look everywhere
some of the armor sets in year 1 were really nice so I'm happy to bring them back.
there was straight up a taken set in d1 that was like that ron
It's all Ghaul's fault we lost all those awesome armour
*zavala voice* indeed.
I'm gonna petition spacefather Calus to grant us D1 armour
I want a hunter cloak that has a feather in the cap/cloak so I can cosplay as Bloodborne hunter
https://tenor.com/view/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-bloodborne-lady-maria-gif-13969664
wait is that lady maria in sekiro???
its a mod
2 more spots open tonight. will be quick it's just two checkpoints @Destiny [PC]
"Guaranteed Anarchy if your name starts with ""criz"""
wish I could finish up with ya! heading to work rn :tfuCry:
😩
GL! hope everyone indulges in a lil anarchy 😈
If only D2 had D1 armor. #bringD3
it aint happening man 😂
I just want my Hive/Taken weapons and armor
my precious
if we don't end up having enough for raid tonight i'll just be doing forges.
zen moment/tap the trigger/and hcr on ringing nail. not bad. probs gonna farm out some rolls on it.
That's a good roll! I wish it could have zen moment/dynamic sway reduction but tap the trigger or high impact reserves both feel good
yeah. i am going to do a couple more frames for it now i think. i like the auto so if i get a good roll i'm going to keep it for SK.
"its curated roll is okay, but dragonfly is a wasted perk on an auto imo"
tap the trigger feels weird on pc to me
I like it on sidearms/smgs
i'm pretty happy with the roll i got. but yeah i'd prefer something other than tap the trigger haha. i like zen moment tho definitely a great perk for autos.
after using something with it on console where its easier to actually tap the trigger it just feels a bit weird
yeah i mean it's also weird bc with autos i want to spray around and kill stuff so likely not going to be tapping the trigger on it aha.
"Just looked at my release week schedule, got the 2nd and 4th-6th off :tfuC:"
@Arixama HELLO
look at this hot garbage
LOL my ringing nail dropped with mulligan and quickdraw.
"put on wings of dawn, top tree dawnblade and icarus grip"
You'll be a global hawk drone raining death from above
i might just do some more auto rifle farming tomorrow night. i really like my zen moment and hcr but...feel like i can do even better.
maybe sunday night we can shoot to finish those checkpoints tho. i have games fri/sat so will be unavailable until then.
high impact reserves is good with autos
yeah I'm down to finish those whenever we have a group
Good luck with your games! Score many goals!
"yeah, im usually good anytime after 7"
sounds good.
"Uh oh, people are getting errors when logging in with “This version of Destiny 2 is no longer available please see Bungie.net for details”"
Imagine if they shadow dropped Shadowkeep
The pre launch period for such a big release must be absolutely nervewracking for Bungie sheesh
"I would get shakes before updating a crappy mobile app, can't imagine the pressure for something like this"
"Oh no doubt they have to be in panic mode, expansion and launcher move AND new version launch at the same time? That’s insane"
"yeah they have so much going on rn. and especially now that they're independent from activision. i wasn't expecting everything to be smooth. but I'm glad something like that happened now instead of, ya know, next tuesday LOL."
"but also...
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/d9jbq2/blueberry_sealtitle_page/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
I'm ashamed to say I'll probably have multiple of those triumphs
hahaha. I'm thankful i don't have any.
wait i'm seeing some people say that if you have the disc for D2 on console you will need to download the entire game and delete the old version for it ?? i'm confused where they're getting that from since SK is just a normal expansion.
"only logic i can maybe see is that fact that its new light, but that still doesnt actually make sense"
yeah because it's not like it's a new game. New Light will be added to the ps store as a free download game.
it's like...you own the game already lol.
and your ps4 is going to download whatever it needs to do automatically anyway.
"There’s some issue now where it’s saying you don’t have the right version I guess, even if you have the digital version"
"Probably because of the work they are doing, something went live early"
"Blizzard people are getting issues too, plus whatever the hell happened to you Tuesday"
"yeah, probably getting people all nervous haha. like redownloading on PC makes total sense because we're moving to an entirely different launcher/library. but having to redownload on console wouldn't make sense."
but glad to know i'm not the only one who experienced whatever the hell that was HAHA.
Bungie is likely doing some kinda backend work so some things may be getting messed around with
"Depends on licensing I’d assume, new light being technically a different game"
i mean i'm leaving my ps4 on all day monday anyway...so if that's what its gotta do...then that's what it'll do haha.
All I know is that copying phase on PS4 is gonna be murder
big oof.
It means that my Monday is gonna be crazy productive at school so
im glad i picked up the digital version off ps+ and downloaded that
that's why i'm leaving mine on haha.
maybe they'll clear that up at some point.
"twab, in case anyone hasn't seen it: https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48188"
For those storing up bounties
Big good news!!!
!!!!! yes!!!
Rally banners!!! Shattered Throne resets!!
thank godddd
They finally patched the black armory grind
whoa: perk changes below
Randy’s Throwing Knife is the most passive aggressive stab at Redrix
New pinnacle weapons!
"""Ritual weapons"""
"sorry, ""ritual"""
Is that a gambit sidearm?
They specifically call them out as weaker
i think it's an smg
I like this emblem
Very 60s
garden jacket revealed as well
im so excited
aaaah
haven't really played destiny since like the first week of solstice
I'm so hyped bloody hell
So recluse did get a nerf haha
"Probably not a major one, and sounds like for PvE"
"Yeah but so did everything else, so it'll stay relatively powerful"
Maybe now bad juju/huckleberry can catch up
"I like it, people won’t feel funneled in to crucible just for a weapon"
"huckleberry is good, but I'm not sure it's worth the exotic slot"
And yeah sounds like they want exotics to be actually better than some of the legendaries
"that reminds me, wavesplitter"
Seems like they are focusing on power creep
oooh
@Arixama can finally equip it now lol
wavesplitter and anarchy are the only two exotic I don't have
There’s an easy solution Ron
Does this mean the PS4 crucible map is now available for all?
Change your name to CrizInDune and you’ll get Anarchy
And yeah no more exclusive content so wait which was the PS4 only map
Retribution?
hang on
"I know there is Broodhold, and god help you now you get to delete Thorium Holt and Red Moon armor"
That strike is so bad
"Upset there's no information about garden, like what power the encounters will be, what contest will restrict us too, etc"
I don't think they'll give more details than this:
"Also, did Redrix really need a nerf?"
i guess I missed that part
yeah that was from last week
890 and 920
"with the soft cap being 900, I dont think it's gonna be hard to hit"
Yeah plus we have some time
When does the raid launch again?
5th
hardcore min-maxing really isn't that necessary then.
No I mean what time? After reset?
at reset i believe.
"ooh, i don't know"
probably at reset yeah
"Trissin or goal if you're going for it, maybe stream?"
I'll definitely be watching
aaah I don't really stream
TIME TO LEARN
I think goal has a game
i'm not on until at least 8pm that day.
If it's like Last Wish then raid might not be over by 8 anyway
i'm gonna be setting up a day one lfg here maybe on sunday for that saturday night. i know we have people who want to get into it.
"i would like to think it'll be close to LW caliber, given that it's the major expansion raid rather than a season raid."
"Yeah, I think it's gonna be a really big one"
"so, we will have plenty to learn haha."
Can't believe the last vex raid was vault
"I mean ""eater of worlds"""
but
it was vault lol
full sized raid lol.
There might be more console completions this time round due to cross save
I saw gladd and datto and co attempt all the D1 raids recently and VoG was pretty cool but some of the encounters were really long
Shorter than Crown's opening
there were really only two major encounters in the raid haha.
Tru tru
"speaking of, @Oathbreaker we should try two man it this weekend"
Crown's opening is unnecessarily long imo
I have a tourney on Saturday and Sunday is a maybe
"ooh, okay"
flawless crown is terrible if you end up having to do that encounter over and over haha.
I would guess Crown is probably easier to flawless than either of last wish/Scourge?
"Yeah, I think so."
Even with the vessel bug my team had no problems with it
What are the odds we try a heroic menagerie run this weekend?
i could do that.
I might be able to hop on
that'd be amazing
But i'm gonna try to get a lot of next week's work done in advance
so I can grind shadowkeep haha
Yeah i understand lol
"Actually, I still need a sole survivor with firing line"
It's not available in reckoning this week right?
It's *the* gun's week
i won't be doing much until shadowkeep aside from farming these ringing nails haha.
I don't want to even use it's name after farming for one so much
So next week Trissin
"I played fair amount of reckoning last week, but never got one"
can't even imagine farming for _the_ gun before the improved drop rate
Please don't remind me
I’ve got a triple tap firing line waiting for me in the vault
Almost sharded it before I knew what it was
You know the supposed trick for better drop rates?
"I guess run T3 until you don’t get a drop, next run T2 and you should get one, and hop back to T3. It’s spare rations week right?"
but then you have to leave and re-enter matchmaking a whole bunch
Yeah only really works if you four stack
I'd rather stick with a strong team in t2 a bunch of times
Which I’m sure we could get a group going
there's a sole survivor in my vault
firing line and field prep
You're set
when did that get there wtf
i probably vaulted it after some gambit or something a while ago
The wording makes me feel like I need to spend the weekend grinding out 21% delirium and hush
"I think you can still get them, and it won't reset your progress"
Delirium feels amazing to use honestly
Lol I still haven't claimed mine
I hope that they don't get rid of the weapons or quests entirely. I've had Not Forgotten as a goal for nearly a year now. If they take that away from me....
@Crizum
Pinnacle weapons will still be obtainable
Oh good haha
"I know it's not much, but goodbye"
Don't forget to use up your eververse bounties
"damn, how do u have so many baryon boughs lol"
"actually, a better question would be why"
I used to do the dreaming city stuff on all three characters every week for some reason
In case I missed some important bit of lore
I just chucked anything over 999 so I’m sitting at 750 after buying tinctures
Those things are evil
"Alright, I didn't end up getting the crown jacket, and I really wanna get the garden one."
It looks sick as fuck
"I know it's maybe more about the completion, but I could have given you my jacket for crown"
I mean the jacket looked sick 😂
I probably would've taken it
I'm definitely going after the jacket this time through.
"Lol if I get the jacket for Garden, let me know if you want it"
"Ok, Thanks!"
although you might have to work it out with ari / anyone else wanting the jacket
"I just hope I have enough time to get to high power quickly, I have a few hard classes this year."
I've got a midterm on Wednesday
It's gonna be so hard to stop myself from playing too much
"Yeah, good luck with your midterm!"
"Haha ty lol, this weekend is gonna be work and studying"
"I know the feel, I have to work on some scholarship applications and my college essay this week."
ohhh yeah that's gonna be a lot
Collectors edition shipped 🎇🎉🎆🎊
so i have to download D2 again through steam?
can i move the files over?
steam has an encryption process
"if youre super worried about it, theres 24 hour maintainence on the 30th and you can just do it then"
how do i uninstall current d2?
options -> uninstall
"Wonder when we even get the jackets. I mean, the season is practically over and they haven’t even been shipped yet"
you talking the crown jackets?
Yah
"so doing a quick google, it looks like people didnt receive their last wish jackets until march or so. i know its not something they have made up due to not knowing the number of people who will be ordering them, so it takes a bit of time to process."
"alright I sent out a bunch of friend invitations on steam, hopefully didn't hit any wrong profiles"
got it!
"also cleaned out my friends list, i had 10 people who hadn't logged in in 5 years and I don't remember at all"
Man so gladd and chevy just 2 manned Gahlran at 720 power
The game really needs some dps balancing sheesh
"next week on your YouTube feeds: **Gladd and Chevy 2-man Garden at 20 Power, White Gear Only! [Full Raid]**"
insane to think this is the last week anything can happen between 401 and 749 power in destiny
"yeah, wow. They should bump up the power of Y1 raids and stuff to match"
My poor 10 power travellers chosen will now be crucible meta
oh no!! our low power gear that we saved is gonna get bumped up too
my fancy 10 power ace shall be a thing of the past
"Welp, I'm heading out this weekend, so I won't be able to play Destiny again until Shadowkeep. How long do you think it will be until people are willing to do the old Leviathan raids now that they include banners, even though there's the new Shadowkeep stuff?"
i bought and preloaded shadowkeep deluxe on steam today. deleted the game from blizzard.
"Actually I think the old raids will be pretty popular for a short time after release @Thawxtem , since a lot of people want armor 2.0"
idk if i'll be playing d2 this weekend so i've kept blizzard lol.
can't wait to delete it tho.
"i definitely plan on grabbing the scourge and crown sets on my hunter for 2.0 builds. titan and warlock tho, y1 stuff has some of my favorite gear for those classes aha."
"Yeah I’ll probably be doing the raids for older gear, i like last wish and sorrows stuff"
"I think the prestige levi armor is actually pretty cool, with like the purple glow and stuff"
yeah that is a nice set.
i might get that back on my titan.
"Still need the shotgun catalyst, didn’t do much Y1"
lol I need it too
never got the acrius catalyst somehow
"Telesto and Sleeper as well, I have t even done normal spire or eater"
ooh.
"well, we gotta take you through those some time then."
Spire is fun
i think my mom is bringing my other monitor today after my game so...won't be capped at 60fps anymore lol bless.
"So far behind the curve on pc stuff. I’m just upgrading to an ssd today, let alone a better monitor"
ooh nice!
i had my 60hz one since I was still playing on ps4 then but now I can have my 144hz glory lol.
"I’ll be solid until Cyberpunk, at which point I’ll spend a whole lot of money I don’t need to"
haha i feel that. I am looking at getting a 2700X and 2070 Super maybe come the end of this school year for me. then i won't need to think about upgrades for a while.
I think that’s the season pass exotic you get if you buy the annual pass
That impact and range is disgusting
i want to see the lore for it now😩
Do u mind putting a spoiler tag on those?
"Sorry, I’ll jus delete cause I don’t know how on mobile aha"
```||like this||```
"Xûr's selling Helm of Saint-14 with rocket launcher reserves, get it while you can!"
I guess that's gonna be really helpful for riven after shadowkeep
and nokris too
"One more benefit of pc, I can swap the enhanced heavy lifting/heavy ammo finder helm out for the launcher reserves one mid fight"
If that’s even worth doing?
You think they are doing a round of nerfs so they can bring back the ballerhorn?
I honestly don't know how worth it it is to pick up since exotics are immediately being upgraded to 2.0
My uncle got the game a while back. We finished warmind last week. After we do forsaken I'll definitely have to take him through Levi
raids are fun
"I'm also looking forward to the new dungeon, that should be really interesting"
Going to solo flawless that one too!! If possible
"It looks like they took the pyramidion, corrupted it with hive and gave it about 20 doses of steroids from the bits they've shown"
"You were undaunted by the Mars Community Challenge.
All players who qualified by completing a Nightfall will receive an emblem in their Collection today.

Yay!!
"So if Xur's dropping all year 2 exotics next week, can we get wavesplitter immediately?"
"If it still works the same way, yeah"
So anarchy will remain my only nemesis
I think they mentioned somewhere that they're changing fated engrams somehow though?
I think just updating them to include year 2 stuff I thought
Wonder how many exotics we’ll be getting per class
Ruin wings pls
"I remember there being something about changing it to not guarantee exotics  you don't have, but I also could have dreamed that up"
With heavy ammo finder around ruin wings would have to juice up like a roid rager
Twilight Garrison please
Hahaha oh god yeah if people are angry about one eyed
Would love garrison back
I'm hoping we see dark drinker and the other exotic swords from taken king
I'd love some sort of Warlock movement exotic (not astrocyte verse) like stompees/lion rampants
"Yeah, that'd be pretty great"
"top tree dawn + wings of sacred dawn is the only combo I know that can do what lion rampants do, but it's so much slower"
The only improvement they could make to warlock jump is making it not continue momentum
They should make it like how Jesse flies in control
"I gotta disagree there. Having to hold space to ascend is cool, but removes the perk of just being able to double and go, plus the inherent infinite slow fall would break so many things"
Warlock jump should still continue momentum
Otherwise you can't do the fun stuff with worldline
is there anyone who would be willing to help me get whisper of the worm
"Sure, ofc

But im not home rn"
i just end up running out of time at the second add room
its so frustrating
Are you soloing?? Getting that far is really really good
i thought it was a solo thing
Nah it's built for a fireteam of 3
well that explains it lol
I've got classes and other stuff till pretty late today though :((
no worries i understand
"If you guys decide on a time, I might be able to join as well. I still need to do whisper on one more character"
"Okay, so I recieved the emblem notification, but my emblems I was holding were full, and I can't even find the new emblem in the collections, nor postmaster"
It's not in collections?
I can’t even find a space for it showing if I got it or not (unless it’s hidden/“unknown”)
probably the same issue as the lord of wolves one
"it doesn't go into collections until a later patch adds it,"
anyone have a succinct list of new stuff in year 3? want to share with a friend
Best I can think of is the release trailer
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LFYJTudJ540
Skip to about 40 seconds and it starts listing the new stuff
Specifically this is the free content ^
"Armor 2.0, revamped nightfall system, finishers"
Plus the website does a reasonable good job of summarizing everything: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep?ciid=48001
got my 144hz boyssss
i missed it haha.
What's a good background too
that background is so cool
yeah i have the Aksis one as my phone background. i was happy to find one with all four of them in the same background tho!
Hmm I just realized I haven't changed my background in a couple of years
Gotta look for some cool Destiny bg
this is my current one
it shimmers
is that using that steam animated background app?
"Wallpaper engine, yeah"
"I've never tried it, does it use up much system resources?"
"I've never had any issues with it, but I'm sure it depends on resolution"
My current desktop is very creative and fun and full of energy.
I remember being absolutely obsessed with Rainmaker once
"made the fanciest desktops I could, they were janky as heck and made my system crawl but it was certainly unique"
Wonder if there's a good Destiny themed rainmaker mod
Looked around for it a while about a year or so back. Couldn't find one
new desktop
Oh man that looks super cool
I'm v jealous
there ya go
@Arixama have you played control?
@RonInDune and i both have
its soo good
they did a very good job building the world and expanding their universe.
remedy are my fav game devs alan wake and max payne are my favourite games of all time
"i wouldve loved to see quantum break references, but im glad we got some alan wake ones"
yea when i found the page from his typewriter i screamed a little
and all the bright falls references
I'm waiting for shadowkeep to blow me away but for now Control is my undisputed GOTY
i think sekiro is my goty rn
I went through the painful task of getting all the achievements in sekiro
but worth it
who was it that wanted to do the whisper mission?
i might be able to help tonight if i'm feeling well enough after i get home from my game.
Good job man
@Arixama when’s mountaintop happening?
In 40 double kills
gj!
anyone available to help me with the heroic whisper mission?
I'm going to go for Fabled today but I'm pretty sure it'll end really badly
Good luck @RonInDune !!
I might be around later in the day @SSimpson
I'll chant Oath's name everytime I'm losing
"Out doing my real world dailies, should be home in a bit if you still need help @SSimpson"
What're you at @RonInDune
1530
"Just got a redrix with ricoshet/full bore and range masterwork, might keep it around"
so uh.... just won an in-house tourney for 1000 silver
In another Discord
anyone running some raids later want to get the clan bounty for raids with a clanmate done
id love to run last wish im ashamed to admit ive never done riven legit
"Most people in the pc side of the clan haven't done riven legit, don't feel too bad 😂"
"I’m not ashamed to admit that, cause nobody ever wanted to when I ran it haha"
i really want to it looks like an amazing fight
“You wanna do Riven legit?” “You wanna teach me?” “So rockets it is”
dont feel like ive earned my 1k voices😂
"Going through old emails, I found my code for Forsaken+season pass pre-order"
Huh did you get it twice?
No. I just never deleted the email.
Overly paranoid
One can never be too paranoid
I think we have at least 3 people who've done riven legit on the pc side of things?
I've tried and failed
no one on lfg ever wants to do it
i think about 15 of my LW clears were legit riven.
you get a 1k voices to drop?
not until my 39th chest opened.
worst experience in the game for me. i nearly quit playing.
geez
0/10 would recommend.
just finished my raid exotic collection last week
got anarchy and tarrabah in one week
i dont think tarrabah is as garbage as everyone says
i don't have either of those but my new philosophy is that if it's not required for a raid title i don't care lol.
I just want tarrabah to be 100% on exotics
still need sturm
and worldline zero
Anyone down for Gambit prime later this evening?
Worldine zero is fairly easy to get these days
"@SSimpson poke me next time your around and we can do heroic whisper, aside from that @Matos if you don’t mind me using a bow I’ll probably be playing some prime"
i don't mind doing some prime as a 3 stack. if we get a 4th even better. i won't be on until like 9:45-10ish tho.
I’ve got @Donpablo with me
I can do some gambit prime
@CrizMobius you can have my spot whenever they're playing I'm actually gonna head to sleep when i get home.
well my fabled progress is not ... progressing
down to 1478 now
Man I don't know how you guys did it
Every single game is against a 4 stack rocking lunas or reclus or MT
i definitely got lucky that the lfg group i rolled with was so good. but now that the only people left in pvp are the sweats who have all the weapons...i can't imagine how frustrating that must be.
i would help but i am not in the mindset for that currently haha.
"It's all good, kinda my fault for leaving it for the literal last day of the season lol"
"i mean, start of the new season might not be a bad idea to get it finished. with the new ritual weapon, will likely have people using other stuff."
I think the most important part of pvp is communication
I grinded fabled for recluse a long time ago with littlepants
"I did get a bunch of hate mail, if that counts lol"
and then did the same thing again this season for mountaintop
"with the addition of the 3v3 and solo queue playlists, i think that will help a lot too."
"yeah, I think so"
yeah the solo queue playlist might be a godsend
like even just having 1 person to work with is such a help
getting stacks will be good and if you have to play solo at a given time you know you can get in with other solos.
and only play against other solos
"yeah, hoping it really makes it better."
Comms make it so much better
"Take it from me, where I don't always 4-stack, I make sure I have at least one other person with me"
Being able to communicate with someone and turn situations into 2vX's increase your chances of winning gunfights massively
"yeah. my team that got recluse with me wasn't like we were all god tier players. we were all 1.2-1.4 KDs but being able to talk and know who was going where, who was together, made everything so much easier."
"yeah I've won 1 out of 7 games I played today, and the one we won there were 3 on comms"
I think I'm done for the season
i wouldn't bother burning yourself out with it.
Agreed
you're at a nice glory score right now. come back fresh when the next season starts and finish it up.
Seriously. The tourney I won today is a major showcase of that. The team we faced in Grand finals was almost definitely better than us in terms of pure skill. We were able to call out and leverage our advantage over the other team by playing *our* game rather than theirs. Comms and playing with someone is key in comp or scrims.
i think the solo playlist will help a lot because it will really come down to someone's individual skill. and then they will be able to increase their awareness and team play by recognizing that there will be more success by sticking with a teammate.
"If people have PvP questions, seriously, just reach out to me in a DM or on here. If you need advice just ask for it. More than happy to help. A year ago I was a half-baked potato in terms of skill, exactly a year later I've won a tourney against some nuts players."
"switching to 3v3 will give it a D1 Trials feel, which will be a welcome change and I think will make things more intense and competitive."
I wish it wasnt survival why cant we have skirmish
i don't mind survival that much. just anything but countdown LOL.
woah I just heard a new (to me) dialog from Tess
Something about how she's not the kind of awoken who fits into the dreaming city
hmm...interesting. i don't think i've heard that either.
survival is way better than countdown my god
i despise that game mode
if anyone would like to finish our 2 insurrection prime checkpoints tomorrow let me know @Destiny [PC]
if not I'll just be doing some forge farming.
heck yeah I'm down
I can be around if you need
I won't be around unfortunately. At least until very late
no problem. I'd like to finish them but not a huge deal if not.
i think id be down
cool. likely would be around 9pm est. shouldn't take long.
At what time?
I can be on then. Probably
9est so 8pm central for you @the_drake1997
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tonight.
"ive never done that raid but i would like to learn, but if you are just trying to get it done fast i can sit it out and wait until another time"
well we are only doing the boss. if you want to jump in i don't mind teaching that it's an easy fight. but if you want to learn the whole raid will just have to see if the others have time to teach the whole thing!
"oh well with shadowkeep i dont expect anyone to teach me lol its all good, if you guys need people ill always help out"
and yeah i know its only one boss tonight no worries
it's totally fine if you want to learn the boss tonight we're happy to teach you! and we also might need a 6th lol.
"it doesn't take too long and we have 2 checkpoints for it, so there are two opportunities to learn the fight even more!"
Also with shadowkeep coming up people are going to be rerunning all the raids for armor so im sure there will be plenty of opportunities
^^ definitely. i know I'll be doing scourge and crown a lot for those sets.
and im not a bad player dont worry lol
but yeah if you're available tonight feel free to hop in. we're happy to teach you the fight!
"i have raid experience, alot actually, i just never played destiny 2 much after release"
anyone know how you will get crucible armor for 2.0? (wing therorem)?
rank up packages ?? i honestly have no idea.
"damn, its one of a the few good warlock armor sets"
@SSimpson don't worry haha we are a very chill raid group. we'd be glad to take you through the fight.
new keyboard coming this wednesday😋🔥
Siiick
What kind of switches?
outemu blue.
"First mechanical keyboard or just a nice upgrade? Either way, life changing 😍"
how about both 😜
i'm excited as hell for it. comes wednesday so i'll be able to jump into Shadowkeep using it.
also just downloaded Office apps on my PC for school work i feel so powerful 😂
Does this clan have people on ps4 also? I’m mainly but I do have friends getting back into destiny that can’t afford one so I’ll be on ps4 sometimes too
Indeed we do
yes.
Mainly pc* sorry typo
Okay cool
"So technically we have separate ps4 Xbox and pc clans, but we share a discord, so if you're in the pc branch of the clan and you play on ps4 you'll only see the people who are online on Ps4 in the pc clan"
Wait @thegoaliebear you moved to pc?
yup!
Yeah I'm perfectly with helping someone learn the raid tonight
"Whoa nice, I'm torn between staying on PC or ps4"
Oh but cross play... hmm
i just saw that keeping up two platforms would get way too expensive for me lol. i'd rather use the money a new playstation costs and put it toward upgrades.
Fair point
Join us nex
Wider field of view..... m+k precision.... _those juicy additional frames_

"cool idea:

"@Destiny [PC] ^ for those who were interested in getting into the new raid next Saturday night, here it is!"
Good luck you guys!!!!
Anybody know what light lvl min will be for raid?
920?
"I believe the first encounter is ~900, and the last encounter is ~ 935"
But those aren't the barriers to enter
You will probably be able to enter the raid so long as you are 870+
That's my guess
likely yeah.
i would say at least getting above 900 won't be too bad and will be ideal. but there's no need to get over 920 as stated it won't provide any advantage.
I'd be down to do raid on sat just dont want to be too low
"900 is the soft cap, right?"
i wonder what the best route for leveling is...just jam through the story and do milestones after that? or like...? what lol.
I'm not sure either
"If 900 is the soft cap, that means blues alone can get us there"
It might be a good idea to abuse a loot cave
Can vendor tokens you think
And jump up to 900
I dont think vendor tokens will up your light
Do they??
I've got like a million calus tokens in my vault
"i want to do some min-maxing involving my warlock and hunter, but not going to go crazy over it."
YEAH CALUS TOKEN LOL.
if vendors help I'm gonna be on that so hard hahaha.
😦 saved crucible tokens hope they work
I wonder how much the new difficulty settings effect loot drops
"I don't think it changes loot, right?"
"Or maybe it does, i don't know about it"
"Higher the difficulty higher rewards, at least thats how it looked with nightfalls"
"Oh right, that part"
im so hyped for this expansion
i'm looking forward to creating builds we've never really had that
as in depth
here's the specific on what powerful rewards come from what:
RIP Pinnacle weapons
so it seems maybe grinding out the story and then doing milestones is a good way to go.
I know that in forsaken you could use vendors to up your light
or doing some milestones before story too. that all would work.
From what I've heard ||We'll be underleveled for the first story mission. I believe it's going to be set at 760 or so. ||
but yeah @MrJ if you'd like to try the raid with us on Saturday for sure join up on the lfg post!
that makes sense.
getting to 900 likely will be decently fast.
Gonna get the emblem this time. **i must**
do you have a team already trissin?
haha I believe in you!
"I do, yes"
"A few are from my crown team, a few I haven't met before"
you will get it and then you can flex on us peasants 😩😩😂
"lool, who knows if i'll even get it or not!"
garden's gonna be real big
"like last wish size, we're assuming"
what emblem?
How close were you with crown?
and i mean... only like 3 teams got that one
"okay for crown, we got to the final boss in about 4.5 hours"
which was pretty good time I think
@Pentan day one raid completion emblem
but then one of our guys
he got hit with a hurricane and his internet dropped
trissin you mad man
and we had to replace him with a pug and from there it was all downhill
I really hope you get it tho. I'm really hoping that for one of the smaller season raids I'll be able to take a shot at a day one emblem.
ahaha thanks goal!
but probably not until the spring season when I'm finally done with hockey lol.
Anybody obtain/have info on where in collections to find the hive event emblem?
I found it on the first page
it's in the events section for the emblems
I’ll look there when I get home thanks
It's a white rarity emblem
Here @Thawxtem
How many LFGs for the new raid do you think will require “1st day completion of CoS”?
"Lol, not many don't worry"
"I didn't see a single day 1 crown lfg looking for day 1 scourge completions, and day 1 scourge isn't even rare at all"
"i really enjoy the posts like 2 hours after worlds first that are like ""must have experience"""
"^
this part is fair"
i think those are more common than people wanting actual day one comps of a raid aha. still just as ridiculous tho😂
"If our team is on the boss and looking for one person to fill in, we expect they've completed all the parts up to the boss and are familiar with the core mechanics"
I'm really wondering how complex the mechanics will be in garden
I'm so curious
like this
"If your looking for a specific encounter on day 1, experience needed is understandable, but the lfgs for the full raid on day 1 asking for experience is ridiculous"
^ yeah that.
god i remember vog. my first time trying i had no idea what it was and i was like 3 light levels under
i don't even think i had full legendary gear
i enjoy knowing that it's a vex raid tho.
i love to hear that haha.
"we finally made it in the door and i was like ""wait that wasn't it? that was so hard!"""
bungo should bring back old raids
legitimately want old raids back
i'd like to see how crota fares against grenade launcher meta
probably not well
i want WotM back😩😩😩
some of the most fun I've ever had raiding.
it's just.. so...*good*
I remember once where we killed aksis like RIGHT as we wiped.
"people slept on icebreaker for the first encounter of crota raid. body shots caused explosions, thing was busted for hordes of thrall"
oh what the heck
ALSO GIVE ME SUNSINGER BACK PLEASE
icebreaker for the darkness maze part?
it was beautiful
never thought of that
i see how that works
just wait for them to group and no-scope
lol yeah.
"mark it as spoiler, i don't want to look at it"
@Chance @ovenjohnson ^^^ see hilarity above
also i may have mentioned this already but i uninstalled D2 from battle.net and bought shadowkeep deluxe + preloaded it on steam so it's ready to go
yas.
Hey so question that may have been discussed here
sadly trissin i can't join you on day 1 raiding. i have work that day and i just got a promotion so i don't really feel like calling out is the right play 😂
Menagerie rewards from heroic come as masterworked the first run of the week right? Would that be a fast path to an upgrade?
So you don’t have to dump a bunch of materials on new stuff
🏏
@Crizum i don't see why it wouldn't. if you do a run on each character that would be a nice upgrade for each. or just extra cores as well aha.
"but also you get 3 powerful rewards a week from the chalice, so even regular menagerie would be a good option for a boost."
i sell my soul to bungo
yes. i agree.
oooh I didn't know there was a cricket bat emoji
@Chance you sold your soul to me
"lol, no worries pentan. I think our group is already full anyways, so don't worry about it"
stfu ur name isnt bungo @ovenjohnson
anyone doing anything tonight?
We're doing Scourge a couple of times
Not sure if we have enough people yet
Otherwise I'm going to try to get to 70000 triumph score
looks like we still need a couple.
@Matos You want to join in? It shouldn't take more than 15 mins if all goes well
hit me up if you still need one when you guys are forming
looks like you'd be our 6th @Matos . Shayne hasn't done it yet so we'd just be teaching him the fight if you don't mind that!
yea thats fine
@Oathbreaker @Trissin gratz bois
2 MAN ARGOS DONE
NIGHT BEFORE SHADOWKEEP
woah!
Congrats guys!!!!
"Nice, congrats"
https://clips.twitch.tv/SuccessfulScaryGorillaHassanChop
Have overwatch comp practice on sat night wont be able to do raid. 😦 I'll unjoin the lfg.
aww...no worries tho!
"😮 that's cool though, what rank are you mrj"
"im 2500 now, took a deep dive after being away from overwatch for a while was 3500"
"ohhh, damn that's pretty good mrj"
if you guys still need one for insurrection im down was gonna do it anyway
we just finished our checkpoints!
oh anyone get an anarchy?
nope haha.
but i did get a rampage/quickdraw on my ringing nail so...happy about that.
Got my hard light catalyst done. 1000 kills is a bit too much sheesh
Also 70K triumph score woohoo
whats up yall
love to see it.
I want recluse and mountaintop so bad lol
Told you that you could do it
Haven’t even started
"well mountaintop is easier to get now. Recluse isn't too bad and I know Ron still needs to get it, so we might end up being able to get 4-stacks to help grind out the Fabled rank."
Remember that a) today is the last day to do it and b) comp next season is 3v3 survival
my boi looks so good
Looking for 2 people to carry me plz in 3v3
wait why is today the last day for Mountaintop?
"It’s not, it’s the last day before rank resets and next season it isn’t 4v4 is what he means"
last day of the season to go for it
tomorrow at 1est there is 24 hour maintenance so D2 will be offline and unplayable
Randy’s Throwing Knife will be mine
"well, i am certainly down to get the pvp stuff now that i know there are people who are chill going to those weapons haha."
"so if you havent dismantled all your bright dust stuff, make sure you get that done tonight"
I'm actutally shooting ppl with my pulse rifle right now for whatever that weapon may be.
Redrix
"Holy cow Ari, congrats!!!!"
Gad damn
"Oh hey question for maybe Oath, or whoever else knows a bunch about drops"
I'm v v jealous
Hit it
"I missed my chance for service revolver back on season of opulence, but Hawthorne randomly graced me with one yesterday, is that now gonna be in my rank up loot pool for tokens?"
I don't actually know. Gonna go ahead and say yes?
If it's dropping in the clan engram probably?
Obviously I don't work at Bungie so I can't confirm but I'd think that's the case
you might have gotten the year one version back in the day as well
"Yeah, if you got the Warmind version you have it unlocked already"
"Maybe, but I couldn’t get Zavala to drop one previously and I’m saving tokens just in case so I guess I’ll confirm Tuesday"
And Shaxx is about to be fed like 3k cookies
Check your collections for the S3 Service Revolver
"Oh, yeah that’s there. I must have just had poor luck from Zavala"
Zavala is a fickle bitch
Ari can confirm just how many times I have yelled at Zavala
I think I'll try one more time for Fabled
If I get it I'll get both Recluse and Mountaintop so I'm pretty hyped
nice. might as well go for it.
"only thing to lose is glory, so really nothing to lose"
"theres no reason to keep eververse bounty notes, right?"
But you can dismantle them even after shadowkeep drops for dust
Shit I still have 300 to burn through
Oh also no use in buying fireteam medallions
@Arixama congrats welcome to the club 👏🏻
"Goodbye, Forsaken."
"Hello, Shadowkeep."
Well this went well
I think I'll wait for next season
most people are doing a last minute push
would not have recommended
it is finished
i'm about to uninstall it haha.
"I think I'll wait until I can launch the game on steam, just in case there's stuff to sort out"
I’m like 2k away from having a reset in Gambit which would finish part of notorious hustle and I think I’ll just avoid getting 21% delirium haha
"welp, there it goes haha."
and now to uninstall blizzard.
adios
self care.
"Just over 36 hours until Shadowkeep. Get your affairs in order, get your doctor's notes ready to call in to work, and have your energy drinks prepped."
*We do not condone actually calling in sick if you are not actually sick.
@Destiny [PC] would anyone want to run the main story together tomorrow night? I'll get on around 9:15 EST and will likely be playing for a while.
Pm? If not I'm down
yeah 915 pm est.
i don't get out of class until 745pm tomorrow lol.
Damn lol I'm on night class. Maybe next time
"well, I'll be playing every night for a while this week haha. so I'm down to do more of it whenever."
"@thegoaliebear if you don't mind that I'll probably be through it once at the point, I'd definitely be down to run through it on another character"
that's totally fine!
I'm also considering deleting and remaking a character to experience new light as a 'new' player. See if there's any major differences
cool. yeah i just wanna get through the story tomorrow night aha. will probs be watching streams of it during the day too.
"I've got the next 3 days off of work, so I'll be playing right at reset 🎆🎇🎉🎊"
"Heyo peeps. New to the group here, but not new to the game. Me and a buddy of mine will be attempting the 24 hour clear of the raid to get the unique Emblem and to let everyone know we have no life. If anyone here has plans to do the same, wanna try getting a group going if we can grind out to 890+ for the raid by the time the raid drops on Saturday?"
"^^^
That's great, and welcome! I'm also chasing the day 1 clear, but unfortunately I'm already part of another team atm. But if anything spots come up mid run or anything, I might let ya know.

Btw, what are you + your buddy's battletags?"
*steam accounts. 😜
"No, battle tags"
raid report lol
"Gonna be honest - We're good at the raids but unfortunately haven't done them nearly as much as we'd like to. So if you check the Raid Report it's prolly not gonna be very impressive. PS4 LFG is usually a mess, and our clan is relatively inactive so getting a group going is rough.

I'll find our exact tags and edit the comment here.
My BT: Kitpaws#11113
My PSN: Kitpaws"
"Okay, no worries!!"
"I believe some others in our clan are also going to be giving it a shot at the new raid on day 1, but I'm not sure of the details"
!LFG search
@Kit we've got one set up not starting until 845 eastern that we need two for it looks like
Ok sweet. I'll let my buddy know. How much time are you guys planning to dedicate to getting it completed?
"I'm not sure what peoples time limits are, honestly."
"I’m west coast so I’ll be around until the east coasters can’t go on, unsure if @thegoaliebear has a game the next day or not"
What time does the raid launch? Can't get to most of the sites from work..
10am PST?
"@Arixama  I'll go ahead and sign up for it - If something comes up and we get into a team earlier, I'll go in as an alternative"
Sounds good!
"@thegoaliebear I’d love to join but I don’t get off work until 30 minutes after you start, so I’ll put myself as an alternate just in case"
Hmm wonder Bungie is planning here: https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/30/bungie-will-release-at-least-one-non-destiny-game-by-2025
Possible Myth or Oni remaster?
i don't have games on sundays. all i have is my afternoon game on saturday so i can go at the raid as long as people want to stay awake lol.
"so honestly...if we have a full group and we're all leveled decently enough, i don't mind a serious attempt at it looking up how teams trying worlds first have gotten through encounters."
I'd rather learn it than bang our heads against a wall not making any progress ya know lol.
@Thawxtem that's totally fine. i made it a bit earlier just so we know people would be online around then. but i don't mind starting a little later if it means we'll have a full group!
but @Kit i am legit fine attempting the raid all night and into sunday if people can lol.
Nice. Depending on if I’m also running the raid all morning then I should be good to raid up to 1-2am if not all night
"Jacklukeson, who joined earlier, should be our 6th. Just waiting for him to finish up the registration"
"Fam if things go as planned I will be playing pc first when it launches. My birthday is Wednesday, and I have the day off so I plan to get as close to a 24 hr stream in as possible as I just spent this past weekend retooling my stream.  If anyone wants to join up and play post campaign I’m down."
"Iiiiiiiiiffff my experience goes well I’d like to try the raid on pc as well, tho I’m more likely to do it on ps4 first. I guess that’ll be a wait and see kinda thing. But i have the weekend off."
"Damn, I'm just going to take things at my pace, like I always do."
I normally do that but with how things lined up im gonna make an event out of it lol
@Kit sweet. we also try to keep the same group for a week 1 completion if possible given that we'll be spending a lot of time initially in the raid together aha.
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) I'll definitely be playing for a while each night. gonna try and crank through the story tomorrow and then focus on leveling after that.
Yep yep @thegoaliebear - id like to raid too but idk how to join lmao. Says battlenet isnt linked but it is on my profile. Also with the switch to steam not sure how that will work. But ill be available
And if you wanna play while leveling thats dope
as long as you have cross save enabled and you have linked your steam account for cross save everything will be there.
Ya. I meant on here lol warmind aint working
For joining the raid
ohhh...yeah...it likely won't work for the entire maintenance now unfortunately lol.
but i will know you're an alt for that. i think we have a 6th rn but we'll see how things go as we get closer to it. we'll definitely have a group for it tho.
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) try joining as an alt now? bc we just had the 6th person join it.
i also found out my 1230 class got cancelled tomorrow. so now can play at reset for like 2 hours🙌
https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1178732398512463872?s=19
imagine getting into that server and muting it immediately.
I'm just hoping we get discord integration again
"Its currently basically a news and update channel, so I'm have all notifications turned on for it"
but...twitter.
but also that || dark intro screen || we love that for us.
"I have a lot of notifications that come from Twitter and since it groups them into one, I'll be more likely to see them coming from discord"
Doesn’t work @thegoaliebear
i have the server muted but whenever i check discord I can just check it aha.
"Well maintainence has started, so that might be effecting it"
@thegoaliebear what time you gunna be on tomorrow? Right at reset or a bit after?
right at reset until about 2:45 EST. then all night haha.
"Sick, unless something goes horribly wrong, I'll be on at reset as well"
sounds good💯
Soundtrack is up on YouTube
"First 25 minutes of New Light, i.e. the Cosmodrome mission is up on youtube: ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ebBrn3_kE&feature=youtu.be||"
ooh nice.
"You pick up a ||Khvostov||, wonder if they're that back as an exotic"
Also wow is that mission pretty
could just be a nostalgic thing.
Is it the mission we played for Thunderlord?
Or no I guess the D1 mission
Different weather
Yeah the D1 mission
without Dinklebot sadly
Dinklebot was not good
"He sounded bored and I don’t blame him, but it was just so flat and dry"
yeah honestly i didn't think he was that great.
Very true but I could listen to Peter Dinklage read the dictionary and not be bored
i feel like the voice we have with North just sounds more...idk...believable for our ghosts.
like it just fits ya know.
"I was gonna say they need to stop getting famous people to voice characters cause it’s hard to get them back, but they’ve had Lance Reddik back more than Hawthorne’s va so I dunno how they choose these things"
"Nolan bot is indeed very good, but he's in literally everything these days"
I actually read an interview with I think it was Matt Mercer? Or could have been Nolan. A lot of voice actors have crazy range but they go in the booth and are told to do that one voice
"Wish they'd have gotten someone like Logan Cunningham, whose voice has a ... different personality"
I was scared we were getting Nathan Drakebot lol
I've never played or seen much of Uncharted. How good is he there?
Does he do the Nathan Fillion thing
"He’s good, but now most roles he’s in want him to do that voice"
"Dinklebot was like, bored Tyrion reading a book out loud"
True lol
Does Jen Taylor still do Cortana? Bungie tends to stick *to* their VAs
She does I believe
They only killed Cayde cause Fillion got busy >_>
😱
"Nolan North is a phenomenal VA, having actually seen the way he preforms when given leeway to do what he wants"
Cayde is dead? NOOOOOOOOOO
Shit sorry!
That's some spoilers man 😦
/s
To be fair every guardian kinda is so
"I mean, Fillion said that bungie didn't even reach out to him for forsaken, so it hard to know the actual motivation there"
"Yeah I dunno, maybe he cost more than reddik and Torres"
Destiny 3 will be the story of Cayde-7 taking down the deepstone crypt
And no idea why they got the dude from the mummy for Osiris and Deadpools girlfriend for his ghost
Oh wait Sagira was Morena Baccarin????
Stephen Fry was in Warmind
"I actually have a head cannon for how like, the destiny story could end whenever the franchise ends. pretty emo tho haha."
At this point the entire cast of Firefly has been in Destiny
How do you think it should all end goal?
John Carpenter helped on the Shadowkeep soundtrack
Oh now I'm excited
"okay strap in boys and girls - so it has to do with Calus and continuing his story and all the lore about how he has ""seen the end."" essentially it follows the idea that we have become his Shadow and it could be like, the Universe actually is coming to an end. so we're trying to prepare for that. and when Calus proposes we become a Shadow he promises that even tho he will be the last being alive, we will still be by his side when the end comes. so basically a cinematic to end it all could be like, we're standing with Calus as the universe collapses or something. and we follow his wishes to be the last thing alive. we take our Ghost out, emo dialogue ensues, and we crush our ghost. then, like, everything goes black, and the OG Destiny title music starts playing as the game credits go."
"and then after the credits roll, there's a post credit cut scene where our Guardian wakes up in like, an alternate universe perhaps ? something that allows ideas of a story to continue."
Something like this: ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/opulent-duelist-greaves||
Yeah that'd be a good ending
"Calus is very much our nihilist sugar daddy, so I'm fine with going out in style by his side
||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/mcxliii#book-the-chronicon||"
"Also we are no longer seeing the guardian level by their name, just the class"
"Levels are gone, well the 1-50"
Everyone just starts at 750 light cause if they nuked us back down to 1 we’d riot
The class signs will be nice to see who is what at a glance though
Man those upgrade costs are insane
stacking up mats is important and not infusing/upgrading until you get closer to cap unless you have an absolute god roll on something lol.
I'm usually good with letting my guardian look homeless for a little while.
helps in the end when I'm ready to infuse and upgrade my fave gear.
Feels like they do this every time
Make insane costs for upgrades and let off the gas on them like two months in
The good news is you don’t have to look like a hobo all the time with the ornament system
The best thing about the grind is experimenting with all kinds of weapons
I learn how shite sidearms are every time an expansion drops
LOL yeah mood.
but for sure I'm grabbing those EV ornaments.
pooping those on EVERYTHING.
POPPING OH MY GOD
I'm not even gonna fix it.
that just about sums up my monday.
:justright:
love that for me.
i watched three minutes of that video....
"for those who might also have ps4 or xb1 characters as their main account:
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1178804165964812289?s=19"
and i will delete a character and use the khovstov
forever
"just make sure you log into the game on your main account first, and then you will be all set to go back to pc."
yeah i might delete my titan. throw all my fave gear in the vault and make a new one so i can play that mission and feel nostalgic haha.
i am still in awe at cross save for this game tho lol. i am so happy they made it a thing.
It'll be up as a daily heroic story mission apparently
can i get it there?
yeah according to some weirdos on reddit
so basically confirmed
So will we all pop a whole bunch of achievements on steam the first time we log in?
probably. the achievements for ps4 and xbox auto completed on login
I wonder what dark days Luke is talking about here: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48187
my body is ready
but is it really
Can't wait for tomorrow evening really. Might stay off of social media entirely for the day
i'll be watching streams in class haha.
"Probably in reference to the reception of launch D2, and the back and forth with Activision"
Man this feels bittersweet:
lol blizzard d2 walked so steam d2 could run.
"Also reminds me I never did finish Diablo 3, did half the campaign and got bored"
Oh yeah prepare for the greatness that is steam
When you check the library page for Destiny 2 do you have Forsaken content showing up in the dlc tab?
could be the migration of the licenses?
with the maintenance i wouldn't be surprised if something like that pops up early.
they said the licenses wouldnt transfer right away might not even transfer till midway through day one or something
Yeah I just saw online some people were getting it showing up in their dlc purchase history so I was wondering if anyone here had that
"yeah mine has the Forsaken stuff and the standard Shadowkeep listed. everything except Shadowkeep is labeled as ""installed"""
so we will likely still have to download the shadowkeep update then?
my shadowkeep is listed as downloading
hm...I'll check again later tonight. idk lol.
"i only have shadowkeep listed as well, so definitely weirdness"
oh yeah that is weird haha.
my guess is that it is probably wonky stuff going on right now as they migrate literally every PC players account to steam haha.
"This is what mine looks like and i just started installing after doing $35 shadowkeep version. Its installing 80gb worth, so I’m assuming it’s on track. In the purchase contents it said both Destiny 2 and Destiny 2: Shadowkeep"
No mention of forsaken anywhere i could find
Mine showed up just a little while ago
"Where, can i ask? Like a separate piece of dlc or under the installed game?"
if you don't have forsaken on pc it won't show up that's still a separate purchase. but after it installs the 80GB the year 1 stuff should show up as installed.
It looked like yours until about 30 minutes ago
but yeah Criz that's exactly what mine looks like.
So the opposite of mine. Thats interesting
I didnt play d2 on battlenet tho so when my dl is finished ill take a peak and see if it changed to match yours
Ohhh i saw your msg goal - so you’re thinking there will be another update for sk tomorrow?
possibly the patch download yes. at least that's just my guess aha.
"The 26gb~ equivalent that we preloaded on ps4? Would make sense we’d be able to do it on pc too. Fuck me ive spent all day stressed l, dealing with problems, i even uploaded a video of me exploding to invisible shit.
Ima go play some zelda"
Deal with this tomorrow (with my pc staying on reeeeeeee)
hahaha love that for you. but possibly yeah it makes sense. the game is definitely bigger than 80GB lol.
"Mine hasn't updated to have forsaken. Generally with steam preloads, it downloads the entire thing encrypted and the last bit of the download that happens at launch is the decryption of all the data."
"Went to battle.net and it auto-loaded the Destiny start page, and I love the Titan helm they chose for their picture"
the shadowkeep download will not take long tho. it took my ps4 20 minutes to download the patch which is what it took my pc to download the entire game that night LOL.
"If you're on Windows 10, I'll recommend checking if auto updates have installed KB4522738"
"One of hte things it fixes is some audio problems, best to be on the safe side"
So this is what my installed DLC page looks like:
So everything seems ready
where you find that at?
On the game page itself
oh i will have to look at that.
Make sure you're on the steam beta branch
It's so much better
steam beta
From Steam settings -> Account
i did that. i like this a lot more
mine still just has shadowkeep checked
basically your 2nd picture
whatever
I think that means everything's fine
I hope
"ya. i didn't have forsaken on battlenet, so everything seems gucci. ill see ya'll tomorrow. thanks for the help"
cheers
i just sent out friend requests on steam. weird that people weren't able to find me haha.
so this means i will be good to go tomorrow right?
Yup that seems perfect
"Barring unforeseen catastrophe, you're good"
also yes this steam beta is so nice.
modern and clean i like it.
Yeah I like the material design/metro UI style
Much prefer to the old blocky aesthetic or Apple's skeuomorph (now abandoned)
my shadowkeep isn't downloading
"nvm, those are just the unlock keys"
T-minus 5 hours until Shadowkeep. :ghost:
i think my body is ready but only time will tell.
"If your body fails, ghost will just revive you. :2Smart4You:"
facts.
"Stuck at work for the rest of the day, can someone who is able to play check if vendor drops can go to 900 since it’s a soft cap"
"theyll definitely be able to drop at 900, but i kind of doubt theyll be able to upgrade you by themselves"
I forget how it worked with Forsaken. I can see how that makes sense though
"with forsaken they were able to upgrade you, but gear was also level locked."
"The contract I’m on at work is ending the 11th so I’m out of this job soon, which means there’s nothing to do really. I get to sit in a room with no tasks and just wish I was playing. Maybe if it gets real bad I can use the remote play app"
@Destiny [PC] Steam license transfers are complete!
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1179057038262800385
"turns on ps4: ""PSN is currently undergoing maintenance"""
:youtried:
i should be fine with the season pass license tranferring tho right?
I'm still gonna try to log into the game on ps4.
Umm as long as the account you sign in on is your main I think you should be fine
"weve got an hour left, so theres still time. im scared to log out of  my ps4 now :derp_blob:"
so my ps4 characters are my main and they are cross saved with my steam account.
I'm assuming that means i can log into them on pc and be fine then?
"Yeah you should be good, you’ll still get the season pass you just may not get any collectors edition stuff until you log in your PS4"
okay sick.
but yeah I'm not logging out of ps4 now lol @Arixama
we love to see this.
"i picked up my ps4 copy like an hour or so ago, and have been logged in ever since."
"Bungie: * is preparing probably their biggest release for the Destiny franchise in an hour *

Sony: yeah let's do psn maintenance right now!"
it might be good tho my friends list just popped up!
yeah i would say definitely try to log in on ps4 first
yeah i do not want to risk anything. this is a huge move for them AND for us so I'd rather make sure everything on my main character account it set.
"and they are really making sure people are careful with it too haha:
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1179064067148771328?s=19"
it definitely sounds like if youve set up crosssave you should be fine no mater what platform for season pass
@thegoaliebear since I’m in the same circumstance - can u send a confirmation msg here or wherever if/when it works? Won’t be home til 6. Thankies. Hope it goes smooth
yeah i will for sure let you know. while i assume I *would* be fine logging into PC since it's cross saved with my ps4 as my main account...always better safe than sorry.
"I'm thinking that, for this week, I _might_ **temporarily** join a different clan for levelling and day one purposes, and then switch back to WIPE as soon as day 1 is over"
"go for it. same deal as last season, yeah?"
"A few different people, but yeah. There are quite a few bonuses for doing stuff with clanmates, and i am gonna be levelling through shadowkeep with my raid team"
So yeah. Just wanted to let people know
we will miss you for the one day 😦
"hopefully you actually get the day one completion this time, traitor. :shocked:"
Good luck Trissin!
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48198
thanks @Samakain !!
thank you!
okay everything is listed as installed on steam 🙏
"mine is sitting in downloads, is it supposed to be there?"
this is what mine shows.
"yeah, it will download the last bit at launch to decrypt everything"
"all the dlc should be listed as installed, but destiny itself wont be quite yet"
Gah I wish I was ready to launch as soon as it dropped
it's 2:30am and I'm up and I'd like to posit that timezones are bullshit.
I wonder for those of us who don’t have forsaken thru battlenet when that would go live on steam? I guess I’ll find out tonight. Sitting here at work like leeeeeeetttttsssss goooo
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090150/
that should be the store page for it
I am on le phone
Mine looks like a random page
i have to click it twice for it to actually go
So actium war rig new meta?
Hmmmm
Decrypting!
yayaya mine just started downloading
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) since the store page exists, it should appear at launch"
You da champ Ari (psst can i call you that?)
ari is what i usually go by since it's easier 😂
Dope. Aight guys back to work cya tonight. Good luck with everything keep me posted and most of all HAVE FUN
"if people are having issues getting it to decrypt, just restart steam!"
OH NO
it claims its gunna take 2 hours to unpack
rip. mine is at 40 mins rn.
"That's what mine said, seconds later it's at 30 mins"
Will new light players start at less than 750 light?
i think they start right at 750 ?
"Mine jumped from 1hr 30 to 4hrs and then back down,  so I don't trust it and I want to speak to it's manager."
base light is 750 now
yeah mine is fluctuating between 30-40 mins.
Hell yeah actium war rig @CrizMobius
"Also this gives me hope? Soft Cap: 900
All drops up to this point will be upgrades to the most powerful item in your inventory or vault"
Depends on if they count Shaxx stuff as a drop
heh heh heh... I'm gonna try and be the weakest player in Shadowkeep using a mask
Think the mask is gonna be 750 lol
worth a shot
at least it means we won't get nerfed (like it matters) during halloween event
The real way to be the weakest player is to have started a new character right before maintainence
That's why I was asking about New Light
They have that known issue where if you have a super low level character you’ll just have to delete it and start a new one
Puts you at 0 power
Man now I wish some streamer sweat did that and is saving a level 0 for iron banner
with this download i really will be playing first on ps4 LOL
Saaaame
"plan your tower visits wisely, it will probably take eons to load in and out of social spaces"
"ohno, did I say something controversial"
@thegoaliebear It will probably take 1 hour to login with all the players
_several people are typing_
like d3
"You think you know the tower load times? I was born on the PS4, raised on it. I didn’t know the game could load quick until I was a man"
"hah yeah, i'm sure the servers will be backed up like hell."
"wait, I've never known the game to load quick. I wonder if Steam will fix that..."
I think you’re just cursed
"When I really think about it, I got this computer to play Overwatch. Never have had any loading issues with it, only Destiny."
It is a hog on mine too.
...a Roadhog?
"Hey, we're all bored right now"
yeah i just swapped back to ps4 screen haha.
10 s
"""at capacity"" like 3 seconds in. we love that."
Now playable!
I havent finished unpacking though
man im in class till 5 tonight
ahhhhh
don't worry we'll still be trying to get into the game by then.
I'm at class and I have my laptop unpacking destiny right now lol
hope noone notices
i can stream it on steam from my pc in my apartment
@RonInDune multitasking
I feel like I should have cancelled class today but I'd have to put in a good reason and I'm not sure how persuasive I can be lol
And I have office hours after this
I'm in!
lucky.
i don't want to restart bc i feel like that'll just make it worse.
I think @LW Mugetsu is in as well
Anybody who isn't doing the story immediately feel like going to the Leviathan?
Says it is temporarily at capacity.
yeah LOL
its in queue just leave it and you will get in
well i got to the accepting the terms and licenses then right back to queue aha.
omg I cant travel to the tower lol
we LOVE this for us.
i waited in the 19 hour queues for tft i can deal with these queues
https://tenor.com/view/rosemary-suffer-wwe-gif-13649109
Well no use to login if you cant travel anywhere
we in boys.
i just needed to get in on ps4 so my season passes transferred aha.
so I'm assuming D2 is still playable even while its unpacking?
on PC.
nevermind got a weasel error and right back to queue LOL
wonder if there's a queue on D1 right now
by the time i get in I'll have to go to class
"game is up, trying to log in. Loving change in intro music"
"Yeah watching Datto at work, keeps getting Beaver’d in the tower"
"so, anyone want to explain how streaming works in Discord?"
"Join a voice channel, hit the go live button and anyone in that channel can join your stream"
okay i got to orbit hahaha.
running around the tower on ps4 currently
wrong platform Ari!
10 minutes til my pc is ready for it :BAha:
loving all these UI and function changes already.
How come I don't have any of my titles in Disc?
"Just prompted me about Cross-save. If I only used battle.net, I should be safe, yes?"
"I am ""unpacking"""
@Matos did you react to the post about them?
....maybe
#role-assign
alright...once I'm in the tower on ps4 i will hop to pc.
Using the app I can see the curated rolls on the ritual weapons
Erianas Vow we love to see that.
"The vanguard and gambit ones seem nice, not sure about the crucible one"
Waiting to join (at full capacity) isn't so bad since this music is so nice.
Also my triump score dropped lol
Triumph*
I enjoy the added commas in the thousand places for numbers haha
Haha eververse finishers
In orbit!
They really gonna get me to buy 2100 silver
"Welp, there is a Jotun Ornament"
Nice to rack up a million steam achievements all at once.
alrighty...and onto PC we go!
queue with me!
i can play it if it's still unpacking yes?
how close is it?
probs like 75-80%
but i was able to go into the tower and get some gear on my Hunter. so everything should be good to go now.
the queue doesnt seem to take that long anyway
now to roll up a new titan
haha yeah i am strongly considering creating a new titan as well.
Already love new quests page
i am kind of getting tired of his appearance tbh...i want him to look better too.
the armor 2.0 is very involved...it should be fun figuring out how to curate your builds exactly the way you want them.
i want to experience new destiny. and also im thinking of not running an exo at all
see...i kind of like the idea of my titan being an Exo. idk why i made him a human.
I'm baffled with them leaning on the new eververse stuff why they still haven't added more character customization options and a barber or somethin. Seems like a no brainer.
I've had the same haircut for 2 years ffs.
i think being able to change hair styles and have beards and stuff would add to the continuity of our characters as well.
exactly.
APPARENTLY SUBTITLES ARE INHERENTLY ENABLED
If I was an exo you'd better be sure i'd be in for new detailing and body work every month or so.
"Oh damn, looks like the season pass is per character"
I dunno why I thought it was per account
i knew it...i literally have to go to class at like 2:45 lmao.
and i still have like 10 mins left on this unpacking.
ooof
:rip:
i will just be learning about the material and armor updates until i have to go. so i will be starting the story fresh tonight and will be streaming it in case you guys still want to join for it!
ill be running on a second character
sounds good!
and it's...it's done. Time to que.
RonInDune... All of our hard work for doing the dungeon with two people... it was for nothing.
"Good luck guys, will catch up in the evening"
love the queue.
"So if I dismantle something with Hive Armaments, will it give it to me back, or will the mod be lost?"
old gear
Yeah you get back your mods if you dismantle
(in Armour 1.0)
I'm just wondering if that rule still applies to 1.0 armor in Shadowkeep
only one way to find out!
"yes, confirmed."
just did it
Thanks Ari. It's the only armaments I've ever gotten
"oh shit so with that armor set you get, you can put any eververse set as an ornament on it."
"i have 2, so if i lost it it wouldne be the end of the world 😂"
Wait... will there be Vex armaments now?!
possibly
If anyone spoils anything here I will write a *very* sternly worded letter
im glad steam names actually reflect in game
Story/Lorewise or like armor system wise?
Story/lore
Gotcha yeah that I understand haha
If anyone spoils something I will 1v1 you until you cry
1v1 de_dust2 shields only
4 stock FD only Fox/Falco lets go
THAT CENSORING THOUGH
Woah who is that under Teddy hahaha
buttkikker LOL
"Nah, Captain Falcon 4 stock on FD with no items"
@Buttkikker confirmed too lewd for steam
Gonna have to change it too Bootekikker
alright I'm getting this opening mission done haha.
gl gl
"@Oathbreaker do you have access to the D2 app? You can see the curated rolls on the ritual weapons, any thoughts on the gambit and crucible ones?"
WE BACK IN THE FASHION GAME BOIS
"(If rolls aren’t spoilers I can share them, but being careful)"
Scout rifle is eh. SMG is useless. Only the Heavy is gonna be useful moderately.
Are finishers universal?
"I didn't get to play much pre-forsaken Destiny, so I think I'm a little more excited then others when Shaxx gave me some of the old armor"
"It was cool stuff, looking forward to the Titan set"
fyi im going to be rocking a green ship forever now
Don't tell me you're gonna be a Watermelon guy now
"no, green quality"
That's..... moderately acceptable
universal ornaments are the best thing ever https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/558695861169946635/628658048516227082/image0.jpg?width=512&height=683
What set is that? Pretty dope
looks like Dragonfly Regalia
nvm
"chest, legs and arms are the season of the drifter eververse set"
helm is the one from the battle pass
bond is from the CoO eververse set
Omega Mechanos ornament for the win fam.
i dont have anyone online in the clan
can i change the server somewhere?
"you came over from ps4, right?"
yes but i switched to the pc clan
maybe i have to add you on steam first?
"i know theres some issues going on right now due to maintenance so i cant look at the clan roster right now, might be affecting you?"
i can see my steam friends tho
"Woo, confirmed you can reach the soft cap with vendor tokens"
"But the poster on reddit said it took about 2,800 tokens to hit 800 so I won’t be hitting 900 with them"
its a lot of rng as well
"Yeah, if it’s weapons you lack for the upgrades I guess you could focus on gunsmith"
Maybe I’ll get a lucky exotic
its also a very god way to get armor mods
honestly you will probably level up decently through just the story. then milestones will be nice boosts as well all RNG considered haha.
I almost want to plan a raid rush day to just run through all of the old ones just for mods
should i dismantle all my old armor? the new blue stuff they gave me is better i think
i just logged o
on*
If you don’t have specific rolls you are attached to go ahead
"you can. and, if you have a mod equipped on that armor piece you will get it back so no worries about losing mods."
i deleted everything except my Crown and LW gear aha. until i get to running those again that armor will stay.
what about weapons?
"Weapons aren’t changing, so you can keep what you like using there"
ok so keep my old weapons i like? and i can use them freely?
i just will need to infuse them correct
everything got bumped to 750 i believe. but i wouldn't infuse anything right now.
stack up on mats for when you're over 900 and whatnot. especially with how many blues and not great legendaries you're likely to get now while leveling.
yeah lvling with blues is fast enough
oh my god hawthorne sells raid banners by 10s
Costco pack
So servers are down?
are they? I got booted into que but I just thought it was being wobbly.
everybody got booted
Oh dang!
Seeing stuff like this makes me think Shadowbringers probably set the standard for launches
"""There's a lot of requests coming into the game server right now! It told us to chill out for a minute instead of giving us useful data, so we're all going to be little Fonzies and be cool until the game server recovers."""
"The message on help forums, in a dialogue box."
yeah...guess it wasn't so bad that i have class until 745 lol.
no part of me expected this launch to be smooth. i can't imagine how ridiculous it must be with New Light. maybe just a learning experience that they should have  launched New Light a week later? but it's here haha.
"Peak engagement possibly, if anything maybe they should have released new light back in September to get people hooked before Shadowkeep"
Yeah it would have made sense to launch new light early.
"i mean...it's done haha. but yeah, a game like this and all the content offered in New Light...i can imagine a ton of people have picked it up."
I've only done the first mission of shadowkeep 😂
deadass same hahaha.
I went and turned in all my tokens at the tower. I'm up to like 835 light
this sucks
hate that for you.
For anyone else who is currently waiting
Knock knock
Who's there?
Buddha
"Okay, buddha who?"
Weasel?

love to see that the streamers are still able to play tho!
Streamer pass
we love that
💀
crashed out of queue
i guess tonight i'll try apex season 3
emergency maintenance
yeah this is gonna take awhile
imagine the suckers who took today off
rookie mistake
I took day off tomorrow which is in 9 hours soooo... might go to work if this isn't fixed by then 😄
I think TR3-VR got into Destiny servers
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1179142336820867072
That twitter thread is toxic.
welcome to social media
where everyone is given a voice and 90% of people should not have a voice
HERE WE GO
nope fake news
Hopefully the maintenance doesn't take too long but I'd rather that Bungie takes the time they need than rush.
I did log in once
some poeple get to character select
"I don't mind bad launches honestly, most big multiplayer games do these days"
just get reset to last place in queue
"I did start a nightfall a couple of times, got Beaver within a couple of minutes"
my screen has been like this for a solid hour
some people actually have a queue pop up
https://i.redd.it/ems53dv4mzp31.jpg
Look on the bright side
It can't get any worse!!
(maybe)
what queue number are you guys at
Let me know when the servers are up.
queues moving now
21K in queue ><
love to see that improvement.
Well I'm back home and glad that I didn't miss much
Anyone else finding that they're going _up_ in queue?
yeah i'm watching Lupo stream and he went from 6.8k back to 7.2k
I think as the evening progresses more and more people are trying to log in
I don't think Steam's used to the Destiny setup yet
@thegoaliebear obviously I won't be running the story on a second character tonight 😂
LOL maybe not even one character 😂 😂
"At least you have class as an excuse, I've just been watching the office"
Bruh I dont even.
I finally made it back in after 3hr of queue. And it immediately kicks me out
Selected character and bam. Error code weasel
yeah i guess it is some kind of consolation about that. might even go out for dinner after haha.
"I mean, maintenance is still going on"
"So those of you who have been able to play, how is it? I won’t be able to get on until Thursday :("
Oh also if you could @me with your response so I can see it later id appreciate it. On break at work rn
"Yeah same for me @Kit , I got to character selection and chose my character, but didn't even make it to orbit before I got weaseled"
"@Pentan well i was able to do the first story mission at least, and it was very good. i like the UI, visual, and armor changes. really, everything seems to be great. no only if we could play it haha."
"@Pentan Of what little bit I did get to play, it's real fun. Armor 2.0 is nice, Eriana's Vow is a very fun exotic as in it feels powerful and the gunplay is smooth, and I thought the new strike with the tower was really cool"
"Awesome, I really can’t wait"
"Lol, neither can we. But we've been sitting here for like 4~5 hours now lol"
will Benedict vendor work for turning in tokens for the PL boost?
"i would assume so, the others all do"
perfect.
"I left for 2hrs  it's still broken? Oh dear, as frustrating as it is a lot of people inside bungie are having the Worst Possible Day. poor bastards."
it seems like people are getting in and staying in now.
"One in my fireteam is chilling on the moon right now, he hasn't been kicked yet"
WE BACK IN BOIS
"Great! I'm still at the capacity que, so if you could just ask in general for a bunch of people to log off that'd be swell."
"about 10786 of them, roughly."
"Ps4 worked real quick to get in, waiting on pc for about 10 min and slowly going down but I have a stream on in bg and ppl are staying in. And able to play with no connectivity issues. Seeeeeeeeeeems as tho things are getting fixed"
Ps4 was smooth
The censored my name!?!?! wtf
too OP got nerfed
Too lewd
hopping on now.
I’M HOME
Time to unpack for decades and go to bed disappointed
I think the Canadians have invaded
All I get are Beaver errors
Wait it unpacked while I was at work?
Nice!!
Anyone @here know how to use lightbar on ps4 to open up director? Rn i have to hit m on keyboard to bring itnup
Try the options button?
Wont let me remap
i just accidentally deleted my 2.0 warlock solstice boots > <
should be able to pull them from collections?
I don't think you can yet.
I just want wing theorem 2.0. Curcible tokens give you year 1 armor.
@Arixama @thegoaliebear wanna play later? Im gonna hit up the campaign dunno where ya’ll are at
Yeah hey will people not show up in the clan if they aren’t in your friends list?
My main acc clan is tied to ps4
So i can only see friends list thru steam i think
Yeah but I dont see Matos
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) yeah we are on the third step in the story.
down to play whenever.
Cool @thegoaliebear do u know how to remap big middle lightpad on the pc
"Yeah how odd, you can’t see clan members unless they are also friends"
@thegoaliebear @Arixama got it to work
Had to remap in ds4
ahhh okay. glad it works now!
peek that power level
i have recruited a kinderguardian into shadowkeep
do I have permission to slap him a discord invite
sure thing!
hell yeah
Just finished shadowkeep. Damn.
nice and congrats!
"Ty, that was a lot of fun"
I just finished the first mission and now lore hunting and doing lost sector at 780 light
pretty spooky!
would not recommend doing the lost sectors at 780
you're clan first I assume
"Not sure, maybe"
Plus I finshed up the ||riskrunner catalyst|| just by doing its mission lol
"||The aerodrome was so cool to go back to, especially with the low light players all around||"
Found a bunny
||Yeah I found one near Crota's chamber||
how do you mark a spoiler
Put || around the text
|| before and after what you're typing.
so one on each side?
No two on either side
| | <spoiler text here> | |
Clan rank up haha nice job yall! :clan_discord:
Bestest clan D2 let's go
"Just over 900 power, gonna start doing powerfuls now 😄"
its over 900
@Trissin daaamn you cray
@Arixama @thegoaliebear have ya'll done the strike yet?
yeah we are on the steps to get the Moon armor set.
yooooo I just soloed that strike it was incredible!
I think that's my fav strike so far. and soloing the boss was quite the challenge
it was a good strike for sure.
I'm done for the night. Got up to 898.
Got all the moon armor and a couple of the weapons. Working on the handcannon kill to get the loud lullaby.
Anybody for a Nightfall Ordeal?
Right now?
But I can wait if nessicary
Give me a second and I'm in
Anybody else?
Work prevents me from saying yes
Just shoot me an invite when you are ready
Need to accept my friend request via steam
||I was wondering why all those ghost were following her but then it hit me. It's her raid team that she wiped||
@Arixama @Thawxtem would you guys like to work on the story stuff again tonight?
Anyone seen the new catalysts and stuff?
One guy in my team finished the Cerberus+1 catalyst yesterday
I got the Cerberus+1 yesterday from the first thing I killed on the moon
"Also, for those that don’t check reddit there’s a free powerful engram for being a Bungie rewards member"
"I see, did u finish it?? It sounds like a good catalyst but he said it was pretty useless"
I got the graviton lance cats on Friday and getting the cosmology kills is a pain.
"I did not, I know it restricts the range if you hold square"
I feel like that’s a PvP centered catalyst cause the gun was already seeing some use right?
"Oh, interesting. I didn't see it much in PvP, and personally I'm not a big fan of using it in crucible"
But I can see how that would help it yeah
"Also nice @LW Mugetsu , but yeah that one's kind of a grind"
I thought it dropped in PVP but I got it running strikes
"In year 1 it was from faction rallies, and then in year 2 they kinda just released it to any activity completion I think"
Same go for sunshot and sweet business
"@Trissin I got and finished the cerberus catalyst, seems pretty cool but the ||alternate fire mode reduces speed dramatically||"
"ohh, okay"
Anyone planning on going into the raid blind on Saturday?
@Infernosi ^
don't think there is another group yet as a couple people are still unsure of their day 1 plans.
@thegoaliebear I would be getting on at around the same time as yesterday
okay sounds good! i think you should be close to where ari and I got now. and i don't mind re-running the extra stuff you have for the drops lol.
Anyone up for some crucible?
i would but i have class soon :(
Anyone figure out how to get year 2 armor as 2.0?
Vendor stuff you mean?
Like the vanguard/crucible?
Anything that drops is 2.0. Any thing you pull except for exotics is 1.0
"I'd definitely like to do a day 1 blind as well so if we could get a second group, I'm in"
i think it depends if kit and jack find a group to try it at launch. so hopefully we will know for sure because we might end up still needing two.
but i will let everyone know once things get set for sure. we will likely have enough for a second group tho.
I'll gladly join a group doing it.
awesome. i will keep yall posted.
So best part of Shadowkeep is drop kicking cursed thralls
Gonna try to kick one in to fireteam members and see what happens
i loveeee the finishers. it just feels so fun and looks badass.
I straight up paid for those legendary ones
hahaha love that for you.
Drop kick was just too good
isn't there a finisher or two in the season pass?
There’s the Belgian kick yeah
i like the base hunter one and really enjoy that it changes the elemental animation for your subclass.
I like that if you jump and do a finisher it can change it. Spiked a servitor like a volleyball
on hunter you literally toss an elbow right to the face haha it's great.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=hHWFmId7zNQ
"@here I'm looking to do the nightfall 100k in a few hours. I matchmade it with a 1.6 multiplier, and it partied me to a 780 and 860 with a 1.0 and we got 38k score with my teammates contributing not much"
100k should be super easy
just don't want to matchmake it cuz I'm not sure what's going on there
if i didn't have class and a lunch date i totally would. but i won't be on until like...845ish tonight most likely.
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) i should be down depending on the time. I’m in a meeting at work 1-2pm CST but after that I’m open
"And @Ransom should be available too, if you need a third"
Ok @Kit my steam is my name here. If you wanna add me when you get in we can work something out
Cool I’ll send you a friend request. I’m online now and will be playing through my meeting but I can’t dedicate the time until it’s over. Won’t know when/if I’ll need to speak up lol
I'm ElwinRansom on steam
What LL are the nightfalls? 750?
there are different levels of difficulty to them now.
and as the PL goes up the modifiers go nuts lol.
"Oh, I see
You don't pick the modifiers anymore?"
"Kinda like d1, where they rotate?"
i think so? i haven't looked much into it but i have a quest to do the nightfall on adept difficulty which is the 750 one i believe.
Ah ok
i have like 1.6k simulation seeds i should probably turn a bunch of those in LOL
Im up for some nightfalls later as well
That haymaker finisher is great.
I wish I was damage immune during it
I thought you were immune for the duration of the finisher?
I think I've been killed through it though
"lots of times, especially when I was underleveled and doing lost sectors"
For sure not immune haha
I wonder if the raid will have any mechanics like using finishers in sync or using finishers on plates etc
"Interesting idea, although I don't think that will appear"
Who knows!
Can you imagine a raid boss that will just revive forever until killed by an unprompted finisher?
"Oh that would be really interesting lol, a raid boss that can only be killed through a finisher"
"Or like, you need your whole fireteam to run up and finish at the same time"
That would be so awesome
Yeah like it could be segmented and everyone damages and finishes their own spot on the enemy. Would put peoples personal dps above party dps though
Couldn’t have the tractor cannon carry
new keyboard came today!
it is so click clacky i love it.
oooh apparently ||bunnies love rice cake||
yes. haha
HERO NIGHTFALL.
DONE
@Kit and @Ransom  ty vm
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) what kind of drops did you get from the NF and high score? PL wise what was the jump in the slot?
you are not immune in the finisher
just go into a group of thrall and finish one
"the others wail on you, you may have some damage mitigation"
I believe you just lose a bit of aggro
oh I think one of the lore books is bugged
||Inquisition of the Damned||
@Destiny [PC] i am hopping on now if anyone would like to continue story stuff.
particularly the Mysterious Disturbance mission.
"Well, 24 hours is over. I ended on a sweet pvp note. Only game I played, after delirious I went pretty positive and felt great with controller. threw that stereotype right out the window i was stuntin on some fellas. But I need food. and sleep. Take care yall. 

For those wondering (basically no one), I got to level 12 in the season pass. Have no idea of the pace of that, wasn't really focused on it. Got to 906-7 power, with some powerful stuff in easy access. The 1st level of Nightfall is relatively straightforward and simple, and the 920 tier is fucking brutal. Mostly because it is a huge spike in difficulty and there's some strategy involved for sure. @Kit  and @Ransom were a big help in us getting thru it, props to them. 

I'll prolly hop on for a tiny bit tomorrow, might play more pvp. The new map is actually really good, even tho I only played it once, I think it's well designed. But I'll def keep prepping and maybe squeeze my way in for raiding this weekend. I know there's already a group. Idk I need to figure that shit out since I'm gonna spend time playing ps4."
"Anyway, game is awesome. Bungie did a phenomenal job with this sandbox imo"
Have fun fam
doing A Mysterious Disturbance mission rn if anyone would like to join.
you doing a second character @thegoaliebear?
still on hunter haha.
Hey guys do you know if theres a set group for garden of salvation yet and what time you guys would be starting
@Spitfire2266 we have one set up for saturday night at 845pm EST.
"Wow, so many people in our clan interested in day 1!!"
"depending on what people's plans look like closer to saturday, it looks like we will definitely have enough for 2 groups."
Glad we have so many keen raiders
Make a second group!
It's the first time I'll be able to try for a completion day one.
"WIPE will get World's first , you heard it here first folks"
hahaha definitely.
"It may be a good idea to gauge what everyone plays, would it be best to try and set up two groups of 2 of each class?"
hoping to start at launch if the second group is open to starting in the morning/afternoon
I'd love to.
Too bad I’ll be out of town on Raid day otherwise I’d jump in on this group too.
"@Kit @Ransom looks like a second group is looking to form to go into the raid at launch. if you guys would prefer that, then that's all good we have alternates for the night run."
but just lmk!
Apparently I'm not getting progress on ||Eriana's Vow catalyst|| doing nightfalls?
Is it only playlist strikes?
it says strike activities so yeah i assume it's only playlist strikes.
@RonInDune a playlist strike gave me 1%
Gonna take awhile
Ooooof
But check out what you get at rank 11 on the season pass
Oh  yeah the ||bonus catalyst progression||
Should get it soon I hope
there's a few available
I’ll be down for the at launch run if that gets arranged
I’m on hunter btw
got to 902 tonight...feels good. will be on tomorrow doing more weekly challenges for leveling.
nice! keep it up
hit 911 its gettin pretty slow might need to swap to my other character
gonna finish off crucible and gambit see where im at
Deathbringer acquired
"Is there anything that has stated what this is yet? If it's storyline, a simple yes/no will do."
||yes||
I'm on the final step of the deathbringer quest.
Poor one out for the two sweeper bots they brought to the damn moon.
"Here is a broom, and here is a near infinite plain of dust.  Off you go."
"i will just be doing milestones tonight. plan is to do as many as possible but will probably work on bounties and strikes, crucible, gambit, and the nightmare hunts if anyone might like to join."
@thegoaliebear 👍 would love to
Eww I loaded in to the tower on PS4 to pick up my free engram and that stutter in the tower and menus...
All my silver is on my Xbox so if I want to purchase stuff I have to log in on that and it is jarringly different than PC.
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) awesome. i should be on around 8 EST.
when i first logged into ps4 when SK launched i saw those 30 frames and i was like
Is silver such that my 300 on ps4 and 1000 on pc need to be spent separately?
Yeah for whatever reason
yeah it's weird aha.
Apparently Devrim is giving out +0 to your current light level beyond 900
"Useful for grabbing stuff to even out, like if you have one lower level slot you can’t find a powerful drop for"
@thegoaliebear ima be on like 10ish. Preds home opener
Ill be on before that too
Like 6-8
holy crap have people seen ehroar's new vid
That a good holy crap or a “how can that happen Bungie!?” holy crap?
**good**
i really really need a shotgun with one two punch now
maybe i'll farm some menagerie
because holy crap that damage is actually insane
Now I’m interested cause I got the spoopy moon one
"Just watched it lol. Can’t do the monte  carlo part cause One Small Step is a primary, but hey if I spec everything for melee regen I can still ruin gambit"
Will they disable titans for world first race?
Oh god I watched the rest of the video
"“One-Two Punch/Liar’s Handshake was something like a 40 times damage buff, this new Titan method is like times 80” 😂😂😂"
:unacceptable:
Hotfix plz
Fix it after we all get 24 hour raid clear emblems
It’s for sure a glitch cause what’s happening is you aren’t being taken out of your sprint when firing the shotgun
"@thegoaliebear Yea, I think @Kit and I would prefer the initial release launch group as we're trying to get the 24 hour clear emblem, who is heading that group up?"
We're both around 911-912 as of last night
no one as of yet. once the api is up I'll see who we have for the night run and who else will be available for a launch attempt.
but doesn't seem like anyone will be *not* ready for it in terms of PL.
I think it's up now aint it? Ishtar and such is working now
so @Buttkikker and @Thawxtem you guys have the first alt spots for the night raid day 1. yall still good for it?
"with so many people, why isn't there a launch group and a night group?"
I'm not sure how many of those in the post as alts are available right at the launch tho.
"i know there's like...4 who said they would be, but they aren't from that post i believe."
so @Kit @Ransom if you guys could join that one ^ and take off of the night run that would be great so we have the groups set.
Well.. if the other group doesnt get going then I don't want to lose my spot in the later group.
It should let you join both right?
gotcha that's fine!
@Destiny [PC] ^ we have a day one raid post set up for saturday at launch. if you will be available right at launch and would like to attempt it make sure to join the lfg post above so you have a spot in the group!
@thegoaliebear I put myself as alt because I won't be available until 9pm CT (10 for you)
gotcha. we will probably start around the scheduled start time so no worries we will have people. but I'll definitely keep you updated.
welp
pretend noone saw that
My question still remains
copy paste error lol
i didn't see it but now I'm curious lol.
bunch of random gibberish
love it.
I'll probably stream the learning stuff on Saturday
yeah i won't be able to watch like...any of it bc of my game. but. I'll definitely try to look at stuff after and I'm not opposed to knowing the mechanics beforehand for as far as the launch groups get.
but if people want to try it blind at first I'll totally respect that aha.
how do I do that
do what
the raid
oh on the lfg post there is a + and ? and -  if you want to join the launch group just hit the green +
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dcqiia/destiny_2_subclass_guns_and_other_symbols_in_your/
im playing in the night one
thats what im going to stream
"@thegoaliebear I'm trying to join, won't update :/ API still unstable?"
@Ransom  you clicking the +?
!register
:DESTINYDAB:
What is everyone planning on running?
I'm running warlock.
Hunter
Warlock
if we could get these groups set that would be great. ik some of yall in the launch group are in the night run as well and i don't want people to get screwed out of that run if spots are taken up that aren't really occupied and whatnot.
"also, you guys will have to re-register with Warmind because of the steam migration in order to join future lfg posts!"
"@Trissin still thinking about that Ehroar video, if it doesn’t get nerfed Titans are just gonna roll in Garden of Salvation like"
"no, it's not actually that useful"
Maybe good for dealing with majors and stuff
But being underleveled makes it way too risky
you will die too much
"even for like boss dps, can't risk getting stomped"
"True, depends on encounter design I suppose. Still, 6x higher than a honed edge shot is nuts"
We'll see!
Raid trailer is up || https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&v=LxIOfW3UTKI||
yeah honestly i don't think it will be that useful. like Trissin said being underleveled makes playing your life way more important especially if you're trying to learn the encounters legit without someone dying every second😂
Good thing it's a fairly generic trailer and not much is spoiled
So you’re saying I shouldn’t yolo dropkick majors?
if you want to go for it😜
Gonna photoshop that Thor Ragnarok scene of “don’t smash” to have a Titan helm on Hulk later on
"Oh by the way, when ||the runed chests spawn, if you're too close they can kill you|| Found that out the hard way last night"
"Also, looking at the clan stats on Warmind is pretty fun"
https://warmind.io/s/325997662715248642
"yeah, it is cool to see just how much people have done."
Some people have insane comp wins and kda
How does @CVPPIECAEKS have 104 kills in a qp game wtf
https://warmind.io/rank/325997662715248642/203
can someone briefly describe raids to a newish player
"Stand places, shoot stuff"
also group puzzles
"what’s the reason for them tho, are they just like limited time strikes"
"they're the ""endgame"" so essentially they're the culmination of the overarching story-line of a given expansion."
"Basicallly lots of group puzzle solving while killing ads, think of it like a massive strike with a lot more involved mechanics with exclusive loot"
"They are 6 person, non match made, pinnacle activities that have mechanics in them that require a certain level of skill and communication that reward the highest level gear"
"Think of it like Portal 2 multiplayer with actual guns, if you've ever played that lol"
I can’t do either of the times here
We'll be doing the raids loads and loads of times later on
You can still get it first week after the contest mode is over
don't worry about it. we run raids a lot so once we have the mechanics down we will be doing it quite a bit for the loot and happy to teach others the encounters.
"We have some excellent sherpas in the clan, @thegoaliebear, @Trissin, @Arixama   etc. have taken us through literally all of the raids till date"
@thegoaliebear this is a weird champ moment but I actually don’t know why I’m not able to join. Says it there is a registration error and I need to connect to Steam. But I’ve done that on Discord and I’ve selected PC here. Despite being really dumb at this what do I need to do to register for Steam so I can join the raid?
you just need to re-register with Warmind so do the `!register` command and sign in with your main bungie account again.
well i totally missed the raid lfg registration feelsbadmna
was at school
there is still a spot open in the launch group i believe.
@Spitfire2266 ^
Not on computer yet
@RonInDune mountain top lobby
need 2 spots one for me and one for kakashi
hshmoobshmoob now lol
Crucible anyone?
@CrizMobius i can i am just picking up some bounties. need to do the weekly challenges for the drops.
@thegoaliebear Sure let me know when you´re ready
what game mode did you have in mind?
"@GustingWind have u played any menagerie? That's pretty close to a raid, except menagerie is easier and a lot faster. Raids require a little more coordination and more communication"
Nope I’m just getting like really into the game with shadowkeep
i'm fine with whatever honestly. just need 4 matches in regular and rotating modes @CrizMobius @Snorlax
also just went to orbit so joining up now. in FT Alpha chat if you wanna comm.
alright cool
If you folks have a spot open in 20 min or so I’d love to join. Almost home
1 s
"Hey cool. Warmind, sometime........you aight."
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) we just loaded into a match but we're in FT chat
kk I'll load up soon. @thegoaliebear
"Damn look at that, Fireteam full!"
good luck you guys!! I'll be racing you ;)
you think theres enough people for a third team?
"Finally got wayfarer, those braytech weapons were a pain."
Congrats! Yeah it's such an annoying grind
It took me 3 months to get 18 kelvis
"Ou, hopefully but I don't think there are enough other people to form a 3rd day one team atm @Spitfire2266"
We can see
Maybe!
Buttkikker had trouble with that one too. I'm glad they made the grind more generous.
Feel absolutely free to LFG if we can't form a 3rd here
I might be needing help with the final step for deathbringer
hey guys whats the trick to get 100k on the nightfall
"I don't know how the new nightfall system works. If you're using the score card, blackout + match game + famine is a good setup that doesn't hurt too much. Also turn that power handicap _the hell_ up"
"new nightfall has set modifiers. i dont think you can 100k on adept, i think you have to do the higher difficultys"
Adept gives around 40k at best it seems
Are the scoring cards still in the game?
"Or challenge cards, I think they're called"
"For regular nightfalls, not the ordeal ones"
wait why is our clan tag shortened
waht the hecky
Name is too
what the hecky
i want a refund
why was it changed
was it forced
Seems like it
I presume it's a glitch
They rolled out a patch to the WEASEL errors that truncated (shortened) clan names. It'll be fixed in a later update
damn rip
The steam names are really dumb.
People that have names that go have the screen coming up in kill feeds in crucible.
Miss the B.net system for that.
Ran in to “I creampied Jesus”..
"So yeah, glorious steam names"
just dropped ina  strike for me
oh heck
very nice
sitting at 916 on my first character hopefully i can get 920 by saturday
"@Infernosi you made the switch to pc as well? Glad to see you here. Looking forward to playing with ya Saturday. If you wanna do prep hmu, I'll have to add you on steam. Also playing crucible, you know I'm always down. ----- if you have a crew/are wanting to build one for comp (or whatever that is now lmao, lemme know)"
will be playing tomorrow shoring up some bounties and quests
Sounds good.
"Currently, I'm hoping to enter the raid with early 20s in power level, but maybe I'll get higher when grinding glory ranks"
holy moly the comp playlist gives insane power drops
went from 916 to 919 in 3 games
so happy
didnt realize every sub rank drops a powerful
Yep.
just need 1 power more on any piece should be 920 was worried i wouldnt be able to raid on my main
My plan for tomorrow is to hop back on PS4 where I can still do decently at pvp and go as far as I can.
"Speaking of which. Reposting from pvp section since this applies heavily for this section and people transitioning from console to pvp, like myself. Please ignore the commentary here, I was losing my mind with sleep deprivation after being awake for 40 hrs straight and on my 24th hour streaming.........ehh. But really solid news for those anxious about using controller on pc for pvp (like I was). Hope this helps anyone:"
https://youtu.be/LxhvE0c6rPI
also @Spitfire2266 ty for the heads up on comp. Will be grinding that tomorrow for sure
awesome im probably down
i would be down to get into some comp for those drops today. got nothing going on so i can be on at any point.
and also don't mind making some progress on earned glory for the pvp ritual weapon aha.
I would like to play comp too
I need all the weapons
awesome. I'll ping you guys when I'm on might have two groups since comp is 3v3 now aha.
I'll be sure to say hello if I do end up queuing tonight and run into you : )
"Lol, I might be grinding some PvP tonight as well."
"Lol, well if you end up needing a 6th let me know"
I’ve been grinding so much crucible it’s not ok
"Like, the addiction is present"
I’ve been avoiding powerful rewards on Titan until I finish up Hunter at the very least so I can hit that 920
But I’ve been wanting to run some crucible so if people want to group at some point
I won't be able to raid day 1 so I'm personally less worried about getting to 920 or whatever really
"I misunderstood and thought you needed to clear by this next reset for the jacket, turns out we have until the 14th so it’s less of a pressing thing for me haha"
well it seems like we'll have enough people for comp today at various points lol. I'll probs be on kinda early like 5 EST unless i end up having plans.
I finish teaching at 6
Should be free after
@Destiny [PC] ^ for those who will be on tonight and would like to get a 3 stack.
well i cant play till later anyways
Re-register with warmind
ah thank you
i got it to work now
cool. I'll be on for a bit anyways tonight.
Prob be on 6ish tonight. Still want to do that mission too @thegoaliebear if you finish the step you’re on
sounds good. I'll probs hop on a bit earlier to finish it.
hopefully i get decent rng with my drops tonight. I'm at 909 so I'll be fine for raid I'll definitely get over 910 tonight.
Apparently you can turn in resources to devrim to round out your gear level if you have some items that are below and keeping you behind
They’ll drop at your max level
Also get and do all the dailies you can go push up your artifact rank for them extra spicy levels c:
"Thinking I’ll skip grinding on Warlock, just finish my powerfuls on Hunter and do Titan to hopefully get past that 920 mark"
yeah i need to try that again. i got unlucky last time i tried and got same drops for my already highest slots lmao.
I’d join up for pvp but I’m gonna help the fiancé through the story and then prolly run with my buds on PS4
Haven’t played with them in awhile D:
no worries have fun haha.
and finally hit 910 🙂 the grind continues.
Isn’t comp 3v3 now?
it is
3v3 survival only
good riddance for countdown
thank god haha.
Matches feel so much faster now
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) i am on the last part of the exotic quest so we can do that as well when you're on tonight.
going to do 3 gambit matches if anyone would like to join.
fellas where do I add my Steam profile to the Warmind bot
I can't find it
just do the `!register` command again.
sick thanks
about to be doing the absolute bare minimum in these gambit matches lmao.
Just enough to get 8 bounties done
i'm not that committed lol.
Can just do the prime bounties anyway
Just generate 8 of them cause they're super easy to do
"my policy is, i'll pick up gambit bounties and if they don't get done by the end of my 3 weekly matches they're never getting done lmao."
the prime daily ones for the different roles are easier.
but even then. i'm still not that committed.
How many powerful have you burned through?
gambit is my last one.
also have 4 more crucible bounties.
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1180209638744055808?s=09
they're actually disabling the reload grips too
Wtf? Even Peregrine Greaves?
With the new punch combo?
"I'm sorry, that's stupid. Those two, unless they're bugged and allow for bullshit easy buttons within the raid, shouldn't be disabled."
"Oh shit, that's right"
Grasps didn't need to be touched
The Jotunn ornament should now be made free for day one finsihers now imo
That shoulder charge/12P combo is actually nuts
"Well, that’s assuming they didn’t have a bug that was less publicized"
"No, no bug"
jotunn and greaves i get. don't really care about grasps. but it makes sense. prevent everyone from running titans and doing stupid shit.
"I mean that being said, it's a legitimate strategy"
Grasps disabled for the auto reload
Nah there's gotta be some bug
Transversieves auto reload and they're not disabled
there's been no case where a worlds first was not counted because the team didn't have enough class diversity
So running all titans shouldn't be an issue
i mean i don't really know why it would even be insanely useful given that people are gonna be dying a shit ton anyway trying to figure out the mechanics lmao.
Transversives require you running around for about 2/3 seconds
but i just understand where they're coming from. it just puts everyone on a more level playing field come raid launch.
With the greaves it’s probably because whatever they touched screwed up and are allowing something that shouldn’t be happening
yeah. there had to be something else going on for it to be disabled.
And while most people who stream and play a lot have them it would honestly suck to have a real shot at world first and get screwed by the rng of not having an exotic
@Crizum Did you not see the video of 1-2 punch and the greaves..?
Its absolutely broken
No I did I mean they bugged something when fixing the liars handshake thing
"Yeah, as such it needed to be disabled for the raid launch to give everyone a fair chance"
You couldn’t shoot without losing momentum before Shadowkeep
I was talking about grasps having some unknown bug
"like, ik most people who legit go for world's first are the streamers, but putting everyone at the same playing field is definitely the right move."
"Even world first aside, first 24hr is still big"
But yeah they likely would've just ran in with 6 titans to get that spot
For the grips.. I'd say its because they want to get rid of the **instant** auto reloading stuff. They were pretty serious about it in their talks about how it effects the game and why they're removing the function from barricade and lunas. I'd say it makes sense for them to want it gone too from the other. Probably just need to disable the ability for it to proc off burn/dot damage
"yeah i think that was more precautionary across the board stuff for the auto reloading. if you're on hunter you're likely to be using OR, RF, or CN. but grasps could definitely be used to give a potential instant advantage in dps stuff if teams really wanted to go that route."
yeah for sure. toss some hunters in there with grips and mountian top or swarm..
"Not that it would be any different from how things were before, but its not their goal with the new sandbox"
i just like that they are taking the measures to make sure everyone has the most equal shot at completing it since you can never wager that everyone attempting stuff like that has all that gear.
Yus
I'm super glad they're doing it
"Maybe, but if that was the goal why didn’t they touch them when they did the barricade and lunafaction adjustments"
"Maybe it slipped past them? I mean, I never heard of anyone doing it until right at launch"
could be.
They got a shit ton of items and combinations in the game. Their dev team cant test them all.. prolly no one thought about it lol
"Yeah but like, it’s the perk of the exotic haha"
"Yeh, but i meant burn/dot damage causing it to proc. Idk lol :idk:"
https://twitter.com/CommandantLuna/status/1180210552985067521?s=19
The issue with ahamkara grasps
oh. wow haha.
@Trissin @Oathbreaker
"yeh, burn damage"
But that's how it's been working for how long now?
thats not an arguement on why it shouldnt be fixed/disabled tho :b
right but the whole point of this is to take away auto reloading stuff.
in other news. TIL its national taco day
ultimately it doesn't do anything negative to the raid launch. so. it's fine aha.
why do these essence weapon quests not drop powerful the first time that annoys me lol. i wish they did.
I wish the milestones at the tower were still powerful :(
uhhh yeah...lol.
I got scammaz'd at first
I thought they were. My friend pointed out that it was just legendary gear now
After I had done almost all of them
i really enjoy getting a 910 prime and having it drop as an energy weapon when my energy weapon is 911  when four of my armor pieces are 908 lol.
@Destiny [PC] working on leveling my warlock now until i play comp. just starting the story and char is at 856.
if anyone wants to join or has an alt they want to work on as well.
Goal do you know the trick to getting your alt characters to 900 right away?
"Did they not specifically say that they were gonna leave Sealed Ahamkara Grasps alone though? If not, then fine, I'll let it be for day 1 stuff but if you leave something as is then remove it because that's the way it's worked and you feel like that's gonna break things, then you shouldn't be leaving it as is

Dunno if that makes sense"
They specifically called out the grasps as something falling to the wayside because of lunafaction and barricade
@SSimpson you transfer your weapons and then pull a blue armor set from your collections. then you get the armor pieces from the season pass. then pull the blue set again until the PL stops increasing.
But I don’t think they intended for burn damage to trigger them
"Right so if they don't want them left at the wayside and leave them unchanged, then immediately remove them for Day 1 stuff.... That just doesn't make sense to me."
They probably intend to patch it but can’t get it out in time
average people end up anywhere between 850-870 so you'll get to 900 just from the story drops and whatnot scaling up @SSimpson
"But the burn damage has triggered them since Forsaken, has it not?"
Yeah well Bungo
Yeah I just got my warlock and titan to 905 in like 10 minutes lol
"So the excuse becomes ""Yeah well bungo"". Trust me, I know that there's a load of ""Yeah well bungo"" shit that's gone on, especially with regards to PvP, but disabling something for Day 1 raid attempts because it's really good now that you've removed every other source of it and that's how it's been working for over a year now.... Idk, I think that's really fucking stupid lmao"
Oh I agree I just try to remember they released whisper in to the sandbox only to nerf it when it was functioning as intended
I also think it’s likely they wanted to fix it but couldn’t get it figured out before Shadowkeep. But who knows cause communication isn’t always their strong suit
"I mean I didn't like it at the time, but that was big power creep and in hindsight needed to be done. It was too versatile at times. Meanwhile, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps aren't the best for everything, and likely are relegated to specific bosses that you can get the burn damage consistently on"
Which bosses can you not get the burn damage on?
@thegoaliebear That Gambit Attitude makes me sad
i hate it so much.
gambit is the best thing D2 has given us
My father just told me that we have some plans tomorrow. I should be home in time for the raid but I figured I'd give you guys a heads up in case I'm late. Feel free to use an alt if I'm not back in time.
which raid group is this for?
It would be for the later attempt.
okay. we do have alts for that so we'll be okay. but i don't mind starting like 10-15mins later if needed.
"Okay, thanks."
Eating some tacos then hopping on
"On that note, did we ever figure out a second group for day1?"
yeah there is one at launch but as far as a later attempt group there is only that one.
FAM. We using Rat King right?
If anyone wants to do their powerful gear im up for anything.
Im looking to finish my last char today if possible
Bruh. I just. A dude shot my missle out of the air in front of me and killed me with it >:C
@RonInDune @obsoleteXeo (Grebe) grabbing dinner and will be good to go if yall still wanna do comp.
Hopping on very shortly @thegoaliebear - tacos are sacred
"Oh I won't be on for a while, if someone else wants to go in till then"
Kit RIP
this years crucible is even worse than last years
how is that possible
@Matos Skill based matchmaking
it was cbmm before
so SBMM is the reason heavy drops more?
didn't think ti would do that
Hahaha
Yeah it’s terrible
it was very...not fun the other night haha
The fact that I'm getting matched with absolute idiots does not bode well for me lol
ay lmao i got monte carlo
jelly
I'm on @thegoaliebear doing some random things like black armory and then bounties
cool. i'm hopping on now.
is suros regime better with the rapid fire or slow fire
rapid for pvp definitely
i prefer slow for pve
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) we are in FT Alpha good to go whenever.
raiding or? Also goal did you want to do that mission
yeah we need 3 more to start ASAP. 2 more if we wait for Ron.
Which mission?
Raid?
@Crizum which one would you be interested in? Thawx was looking for leviathan raids.
"Oh I’m down to do literally any raid most of the time aha, just would need pointers on EoW and SoS and slight refreshers on normal leviathan"
I'm down for a raid.
i would likely have time for a leviathan+eater.
join in the raid chat if you wanna do it tho haha.
Haha ok
ah you guys have 6 already
^ you can join
ty yt
"The humble monly bundle early unlocks for next month just got released today and they're cod wwii, crash bandicoot trilogy, and spyro reignited"

"@Infernosi @Peronix @CrizMobius @obsoleteXeo (Grebe) 
@Ransom and I are up to 920 for tomorrow. Gonna pick up a few extra weapons/armor in case I need to infuse. Any suggestions on what we're looking to bring in?"
Short range and far range options
Ad clears and dps for both slots
Gear with the mods
"Barrier, etc."
Spare infusion material in case we need something in the middle
"^^
I would recommend some gear like izanagi, outbreak, whisper, maybe deathbringer and MT"
"@Kit moutaintop, recluse and anarchy would be a good start then adapt from there"
maybe also infuse one exotic for the subclass you're most likely to run but no need to go crazy with it. I'm 915 and put on an exotic i pulled from collections and I was 913.
so it won't bring you down so much. but if you really want to maximize your PL for the last encounter getting one up is probably good. but even then you will get drops along the way from the encounters anyway so maybe not too important as the weapons.
so for tonight @Crizum @Arixama @MrTster @Nahkriin @Buttkikker you are all still good for the raid? i know Nahkriin said he might be a little late but long as everyone is still available that's all that matters!
"@Kit outbreak might be good. Izanagi could be strong. Sole survivor or another sniper with firing line will be dope. Recluse, loaded question, spike grenade launchers, swords w whirlwind, auto rifle/hand cannon for combatant shields, im trying to have my bases covered"
"That said idk what my light level will end up looking like. Rn I’m 916 but power and robe slot are way below (like 906 and 909), so im gonna do deathbringer mission to shore up 1 and then hopefully get the robes from essence on moon - devrim wasnt nice to me and i couldn’t find robes"
that PL is perfect for the raid and yeah if you play at all before launch time just see what kind of drops you get before you infuse. i actually modded up my armor set the other night just having each piece with 5 energy slots and going from there.
Unless the earth explodes I should be on
"I’ve got spike grenade for all elements. Outbreak, mountain top, recluse, bygones, telesto. I forgot to finish deathbringer but I’m at the end of the quest"
I’ll pull izinagi
@thegoaliebear I'm good to go
I am stream ready
good luck to our launch group! hope you make a lot of progress and get that day 1 clear! :destiny_logo: :clan_discord:
"^^^
Best of luck!! I'm gonna be racing you guys :beeGLHF:"
can't wait to see that 24 hour play time in D2 for you today haha!
"sweet guys, SBMM"
"""rEnEwEd FoCuS oN pVp"""
"always remember this, take out crucible in Destiny and pour those resources into the good parts of the game"
200 IQ plays
Nah crucible is fun
pvp is bad.
"Destiny PVP has always been bad. If you want a solid PVP experience, there are so many other options in the market right now"
Did you see the 60 fps Halo reach MCC gameplay?
nah I think it’s fun
our games last night were split evenly between teams with literal potatoes followed by literal Unbrokens. possibly influenced by everyone's glory reset. but. no way SBMM played any role last night lmao.
"What Destiny does better than others is the PVE, double down on that to set yourself apart from the competition"
"people think it's fun and whatever, but it's not...*good*"
you can have fun with it teddy but there is a reason no one cares about Crucible in the wider sphere
pve has always been the core of the game.
It is good tho
Yeah obviously
@Matos i find there's also no longevity to it. people get the pinnacle weapon and then don't touch it after that.
"SBMM seems to try to average out the teams, rather then make everyone of the same caliber."
Funnily enough Destiny PvP still has a bigger playerbase than CoD right now
"what will make me quit Destiny is not getting bored of it, its the fact Bungie keeps making go into the Crucible time and time again"
beginning of season when pvp actually serves a purpose for leveling people will jump into just for the sake of getting the weekly milestone drop.
"Rainbow Six Siege, CS:GO, DOTA/LoL for the RPG PVP"
"so many better options, stop wasting time and resources on lost causes"
If you don’t like it you don’t have to play it lol
...but we do
for quests
for meta pve weapons
"same with comp. the powerful drops are nice but now with the raid and vex offensive, people will drop out of that once they get the 2100 glory for the ritual weapon. or those that don't even go for the gun will just...not play it now that they have endgame pve stuff lol."
for powerful drops to level up
do i keep going?
You don’t need those weapons to play the game tho
It’s not a requirement
"that is a bad argument.

if we are looking at requirements, then you don't need ANYTHING to play the game"
Recluse was really the only weapon that seemed worth the grind to me. the prior pinnacle weapons were definitely pvp oriented which is always how it should be.
you can use your khovstov from mission 1
you're still playing the game
You can use what you like
Some weapons are better than others yes
That's true but also quite naive in a realistic context
"i think overall, pvp is just unwelcoming for new players or those who missed out on certain weapons. so that certainly doesn't help the player activity in it long-term."
@here launch crew im grabbing lunch and showering then popping on stream and ready to go! Got to 919 and have a diversity of weapons. Have not yet used anything on armor mods but can do if necessary
HYPE HYPE
I like destiny pvp lol
I’m not even using op weapons either
It’s fun to find some secretly good weapons
Yeah I like PvP too especially cause I'm frequently really bad and it's often hilarious
i can't just like...play it solo haha. i have to be with another person or group to motivate me to actually play well😂
@Matos The example picture you gave was horrible. That look to be a very competitive game and a close one at that. Just because you finished with a high kill death doesn’t mean you should always win. I think PVP is really fun and really creative and it’s easy to get very salty and upset about it because you run into a stack team. But that’s going to be the case with any game as well as sometimes you always don’t play the best and sometimes your parents don’t always buy the best or vice versa. The problem does live with SB am in though but the picture you posted was a poor example of it. I do think there should be more of a ranking system similar to overwatch or league. Also for what it’s worth never usually as a game to equate to anything being good. That was the worst experience I’ve ever had in a video game and saying that D2 pvp is worse than that is a stretchhhhhhhh.
Also speech to text really coming in clutch here
Also bungie has acknowledge the pinnacle weapon issue
"@CrizMobius  and company, I'll be in the chat shortly. Gonna stuff my face with my lunch real quick"
20 mins have fun yall!
Yep yep this zax gonna be op
good luck with the raid guys
Anyone heard anything from  ElwinRansom?
Hes in our other discord. He's just about ready
Setting things up and ill be joining
good luck to the PC raid teams!
"Dropping PvP out entirely would kill my enjoyment of the game. I play this game because of PvP, PvE is fun but it gets so fucking boring. It is the exact same encounters on lockout each week. There's no variety. You play PvP and it means you actually have to think about what you're doing rather than just being bored because of the same shit, just different day. I have found no other PvP based game that is even remotely close to how Destiny feels. There's a reason I've stuck with this game. It's the Crucible."
"I enjoyed Borderlands 2 for a single playthrough, even with friends. Subsequent playthroughs are the exact fucking same. There's no variety. Oh, yay, bigger numbers, they deal more damage. Otherwise, it's the exact same. Borderlands is entirely PvE (I will say that it is a great game, not trying to knock it or anything, just as comparison) and my hours in it pale in comparison to Destiny."
"And comp MM is really fucky right now anyways. I still highly recommend getting a team to play with because trying to solo queue is possible but it's hit or miss, even with Freelance being introduced."
"Even the PvP players don't care for quests that force PvP on people. Give the option for PvE. Make everyone happy. But for quests like Thorn, PvP players didn't bitch about having to go into PvE for it. They want the gun, they'll go and get it. Take a step back from the salt and look at things objectively."
"@thegoaliebear Yeah I'll be around for sure, just hit 920 before sleeping last night and I'll be leveling weapons a bit before we go"
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) Let me clarify then. Destiny 2 PVP is the worst PVP Shooter experience in the market today.
hope that's nuanced enough for you
"We gotta stop whiteknighting Bungie on this things. Destiny 2 is in year 3 and as a franchise into year 6(!). It's getting really tiring telling myself ""It will get better...In the future they will fix x,y or z"""
if you don't like the game don't play it.
simple
"As for PvP the issue I mainly have is, sure I could NOT use Recluse/MT etc but when those are the main meta option for PvE, and I could NOT finish off all those exotic quests but if I'm a purely PvP player I don't have those same issues?"
Not having MT/Recluse for PvE isn't the same as not having Anarchy for PvP
Ritual weapons are a step in the right direction cause they aren't OP. Crucible has a harsh learning curve though for new players
"Hard disagree on it being the worst PvP shooter. Yes, there's bullshit moments. Every fucking game has bullshit moments. You want to tell me that this is less enjoyable than COD with its near instant TTKs and little options for skill based outplays? Because D2 has good TTKs, good expression of skill in methods of outplaying someone, good movement, good gunplay. Matos, how often have you, or Ari, or ANYONE, heard me bitch about Bungie not fixing something yet? The PvP community doesn't give them a pass. We play the fucking game though because it's the game we have."
"I'm sick of hearing from you that the Crucible should be removed without question or hesitation when I loathe Gambit yet still say it's decent. I can see the good within a mode. Evidently, you can't."
"I think the best example of the way they *should* be doing the pvp weapon exotic quests is the thorn quest that was mostly ""do this pvp or this pve thing"""
@Oathbreaker well said
Just speaking for me again
"I apologize for the salt, rage, whatever, but come on man. A year ago I hated PvP, now I'm at where I am. I just won a fucking tourney. You put the time in with this game and its PvP environment and you'll get rewarded."

where is eyes on the moon mission?
im confused
"||Start by talking to Ikora, on the moon  there are those vex symbols on the map and if you hang around one long enough Vex start coming from the sky. Kill them||"
How’s the raid going
Just got online
Good luck raid doggo
We are at the second encounter now
@Ransom
Between the Crown of Sorrow raid weapon and the Vex Offensive weapons I think someone over at Bungo has a thing for dirty guns.
how is the worlds first stuff going overall? what is the furthest people are getting?
"Reddit isn’t loading for me to check, but about an hour or two ago ||a few teams were at the final encounter assuming Triumphs are correct||"
oh sick.
Yeah people are definitely at the final encounter and they've found almost all of the hidden chests I think
"Also it's incredibly, jaw-droppingly beautiful"
What weapons are people running in the raid?
"Eriana's vow is pretty good, plus snipers for damage"
perfect. I'll be looking at the encounters before our night run if people don't mind. would love to know what to do so we can really make a legit push for the 24 hr clear considering we're starting much later!
Massive raid spoilers here: ||https://redd.it/ddrbh5||
The plans I had today fell through so I will definitely be on time.
WOW they're fast
awesome. i really think we can do this guys😄  people are already at the final encounter and we are at good levels!
I'm rooting for ya folks! You got this!
who all is in the 2nd group?
I am not
"Oh crap, spoilers for the vex thing but ||The Undying Mind? Nice throwback||"
WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME
one guy in my team's internet went down
i swear
NOOOO
every time I do a day 1
Oh nooooo
you got this still
angery
I believe in you
"@Matos I'm in the raid right now so I have no idea what the replies were like, but don't get mad at me. And don't share your disappointment and frustration into a public forum to cause that same sentiment to people who are enjoying and trying to enjoy the game. RAGE in games. Did you see my last video on pvp? I'm raging the fuck at teammates, the game, whatever. But I do that as part of my enjoyment of competitiveness of the game, not as a ""THIS GAME SUCKS WAAAAAAA WHY DOES PVP EXIST"" - PVP exists, it will always exist, and its important will vary to different players. If you're not having fun. Listen to @Teddy. Don't play. Bungie just made changes so you don't have to"
/end rant
"so for tonight it is me, ari, tster, crizum, nahkriin, and buttkikker confirmed. let's get it boys!"
Hold on I think my Internet is having issues
Hope Raid Team 2 has a blast! Good luck and have fun
If anyone is streaming let me know
"Internet on my PC seems to be trashed. Can't even pick up a wifi signal after restarting. Sorry guys, AT&T keeps finding ways to kill my sanity"
:C
"Damn, that sucks"
"buttkikker, Thawxtem#1347, CrizMobius, Sabre"
anyone know of videos or guides for the encounters yet? just watching datto stream currently.
"Oh, right."
@thegoaliebear my stream for the last encounter xD
@Infernosi get Sabre in there with you guys if he's on and leveled.
Broman has it

@Sabre Do you want to help us with encounter 2 in the raid?
|| spoilers ||
|| https://www.twitch.tv/videos/490608705?t=02h56m27s ||
^^^ our successful first raid encounter spoilers included
Clan Ascend apparently just got world's first

so...roughly 6.5 hours for world's first. not bad at all. we can definitely do this.
Indica just finished
GOOD.
i don't mind the rest of that group. just can't stand gladd lmao.
@here anyone down for the 2nd encounter of the raid? Peronix had internet issues
Here's the worlds first completion end : ||https://clips.twitch.tv/MoralUgliestHamOSsloth||
yeah if you can explain to me how to do it and Ill join
k sabre join our discord and then you can find us on thru clan on destiny
voice channel* lol
The winners: ||https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1180626468847570945||
There was apparently a 2 minute difference between 1st and 2nd
||https://twitter.com/kingkeoua/status/1180626169441341440||
So apparently world's second was an Xbox team and not Indica?
Can anyone confirm?
if it is then thats amazing
"hey guys i have 5 friends who have never done a raid before, so i was going to take them through the first one, we need one person, is anyone willing to help?"
how's 8:00 pm team having it?
this raid is fantastic
"Team 2: Reset buff on 2, Clear 2, Help 1 or 3 Angelics

Team 1: Reset buff on 4, Clear 4 then 1
Team 3: Reset buff on 4, Clear 4 then 3

Full Rotate: Help 2 angelics
No Rotate: Stay on 1 or 3"
aRo - T1
i had to leave
if someone wants to learn about the raid
there is a spot open
in raid bravo
aggghhh this freaking boss
is so annoying
this takes forever
Which encounter?
the boss
thats why im upset
So if anyone wants to run the ||Divinity quest steps in the raid|| after contest mode is over lemme know!
"@RonInDune I think ||you need to run the whole raid doing steps after each encounter yes?|| I know myself, @Arixama and @Buttkikker are on that step"
"I think so, i haven't seen any video outlining everything yet"
"||I went into the raid to see if I can do anything solo, but it's impossible||"
We may have a group forming for later if enough are interested
||The first tether requires atleast 4 people I feel like||
Hmm maybe I can join after contest is over
Only two hours until it’s over
I'll be available around 6 central
depends when i finish my work today but yeah i think like 7ish est i should be good.
Lol Titans can solo ||grab all Voltec charges in the garden using the same method they can solo Dul Incarnu||
have to stop around 11 tho. but without being level capped i think that first encounter will be much better LOL.
Is it similar to the ||Spire mechanic wher you can pop your super and greed stacks reset?||
"Yeah, ||using banner shield you don’t die and your stacks stay at 2, you can then continue to grab stacks and it won’t go beyond 2 so you don’t die||"
how exactly do you start the divinity quest?
||Go to the start of the raid  location in patrol||
||Kill what you see until a boss and it'll drop the quest||
"||On the moon load in to sorrows harbor, head to the lunar battlegrounds and turn left in to a cave to get to the raid portal, kill things until boss spawns. Lost sectors on Nessus after, kill Vex in the Incursion, then you should be on the raid step||"
"i had a thing where it said ""requires eye on the moon"" or whatever for the vex incursion is that what that is?"
i have no idea what quests or whatever i have at this point I was way too tired last night to remember lol.
"For that you gotta hang around after any public event on the moon, not sure if it has to be heroic"
After the event is over you’ll see vex invade and you need to kill three gate lords and a mind
Go talk to Ikora to start that
oh i have that then i already did one of those yeah.
"The Vex Offensive feels very rewarding BTW, maybe not quite as good as Menagerie but way easier"
"Yeah, at some point this season I wanna set up a group to go for a deathless run for Undying"
That should be fairly easy
well i will be going for both Undying and Enlightened so. count me in whenever we get to that point aha.
I did a personal deathless run until I lept off the ledge trying to explore at the end
well I think I'm giving up on my Ludum Dare run so I'll probably be awake at 6-ish central
alright. as it gets closer to the evening we will see how many people we have for a potential raid. getting through that first encounter would be really nice and hopefully have enough time to at least start and get used to the second encounter.
If we're on power the first encounter shouldn't be quite as annoying hopefully
Not getting constantly one shot helps
yeah the first encounter is 890 i believe since the boss is 940. so we will have a level advantage going into that first one and a little for the second encounter.
Oh I'm still 917 I think so later encounters might be tough
Maybe I'll do some PvP to get quick light
i would be down for some pvp as well for the drops. do those powerful drops only come from comp or do they also drop from ranking up valor?
"Comp is just faster cause you get glory and valor, but they should come from all rank ups"
There’s also the 100k nightfall if anyone wants to try that with me haha
oh sick. hm...maybe I'll see what that solo queue playlist is like but quickplay is usually easier for me if I'm solo aha.
oh I'm down for that too!
I need to do the 100k Nightfall as well
sweet. when are you guys available today?
anytime really
okay. i am going to try an get on for a bit maybe around 230 est.
That should work for me
rip no emblem :(((
"we got the boss down to like, a quarter-ish hp"
after 2 damage phases
aww :/ well congrats on getting that far tho!
"Dang, well there’s always next time!"
Jelly. Good stuff @Trissin
how do i get to the raid entrance from patrol?
If you wanna join me I can show you
sure thing.
how did you guys do in the raid?
Which group?
"Haha, ty kit. Excited to complete the raid with out clan in the future!"
It's a fun one.
"Later group didn't get past the first encounter, but we were only able to try for an hour or two"
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to join me and criz for some pvp?
I made it to the final boss but didn’t end up finishing wasn’t sure if the clan needed extras would be happy to finish with the clan. The group we were in had a really self centred ass that would take any ideas
So that means a bunch of people will get the emblem who haven't finished during contest
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i stopped going at 10am pdt
cuz i thought it was over
we were so close
we got through multiple damage phases and got the boss low
AHHHHHHHHHH
😭
Oooof
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to join for the garbage that is comp pvp?
sure give me moment
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/de454c/you_can_farm_vex_invasions_on_the_moon_for/
doin that rn actualy
"@Destiny [PC] who would be interested in trying the first encounter of the raid tonight? so far i know me, ron, crizum, and ari would. so we would need 2 more."
I can
So Sweat and co. have one phased ||the consecrated mind|| using mostly izanagi and wendigo.
Want to fill the last spot? We have experienced
||https://twitter.com/Sweatcicle/status/1180984815648198656||
Oh and Teawrex posted all ||the Divinity quest steps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ9ChUOphNk&feature=youtu.be||
@thegoaliebear I’ll join
@thegoaliebear I might be a available depending on the time
I'll be back home in a few hours
i have a hard stop at 11 est. so. any time before then.
Are you looking to only do the first encounter?
likely will be all i have time for yeah.
@Arixama give me 5-10 mins finishing vex offensive lol can't believe that was censored 😂
it wasnt censored for me?
oh weird it was on mine haha.
What are yall up to right now? Still PVP?
@thegoaliebear @Matos
yeah we are in comp rn.
invite me whenever
we are doing quickplay clash rn if you want to join?
watching for when someone leaves
Gotta restart real quick first
"Hey so can any of these Leviathan keys be accessed solo?
Irrigation/Drain/Pipeline"
"Irrigation you can definitely access by yourself. Drain and Pipeline are watcher rooms, but drain is pretty easy and you should be able to solo that one"
"Pipeline might be a bit more difficult, but I think you can do it
It's the really big watcher room with 2 floors and the colossus, where you enter & exit from pipes. (Near the throne room)"
"Ohh yeah I remember, thanks trissin!"
And keys go away at Tuesday reset?
"Hey @Trissin in encounter 3 ||how were you damaging the boss? He runs so fast, stagger mods?||"
"I think so, unless they're in your postmaster"
"@Crizum ||Big thing here is that tether slows the boss down a little bit. Our team used izanagi, whisper, darci, and 1kv for damage||"
"||Lack of hunters may have been the issue, no tethers||"
"||Part of it is just hitting those shots, they're easy to miss but izanagi's does such big damage on those crits||"
"||A lot of encounters in garden really demonstrated the power of izanagi's burden, it's definitely the meta moving forward. It doesn't depend on heavy ammo, and can output so much damage - both as a total in reserves, and also as immediate burst||"
"||Izanagi's is how Sweat and co. used to one phase the boss, and did so pretty easily||"
||They pre placed wells all along the route||
"I ||wanted armor, of any slot, got a shotgun and a bow :/||"
Lol I got the bow too.
How is the bow? Oh and has anyone here gotten ||Divinity yet?||
"I'll get that eventually, it's on my big todo list"
I'll need to get that catalyst for izanagi's ASAP
"It's actually pretty busy for me this time of the year in terms of irl stuff, but I think my current goal is to snatch that new raid title: || _""Enlightened""_ ||"
"I think there are some others here who need to run heroic menagerie as well, and I don't mind joining"
Yeah I don’t mind helping
maybe we can knock out a quick run tomorrow
so who would like to do the first raid encounter maybe the second one tonight? would be around 8est for me. I'd like to try it before reset! @Destiny [PC]
I don't think I have anything going on!! I'd be down. What light level is ideal?
890 for first encounter and 900-910 for second i believe.
"Ok, I'll be ok then. I'm like 904, 905"
okay i made a post for anyone interested. @Destiny [PC]
ey ill actually be around! def down to learn this!
okay cool. just make sure you are as close to 910 as possible for the first couple encounters.
I should be 920 on all classes and getting Izanagi's catalyst rn 😄
okay great.
@the_drake1997 just make sure to add yourself to the lfg post so your spot isn't taken don't want there to be confusion tonight aha.
"Added myself as an alt, won’t be home until about 30 or so after the start time"
so full group and a couple alts in case awesome.
Just watched Ehroars video on the raid exotic. Need to get that thing lol
yeah. i am more concerned with completing the raid first haha.
Seems like the quest is account based though. Was running titan last night and eris had the final step as an abandoned quest for me
Almost had the third encounter down but it was almost midnight
if you have to get it in one go of the raid then I'm not concerned about it right now haha.
but it seems easy enough to do within the raid itself.
Huh there'll be a Destiny 2 speedrun at GDQ this year
https://twitter.com/Shockwve/status/1181008724208558080
"AGDQ, yeah?"
Probably!
It'd be great if they do a petras
Hopefully that'll be a donation incentive
I'll be on around 630 before the raid to grind out some strikes for Edgewise and the vanguard shaders/emblem quest steps. if people wanna join then lmk!
also for the crucible quest for the emblem. it says reach valor Heroic. i am Heroic III and i played an extra match but it still didn't tick the box as completed. is this a bug or like...what? if people have had the same thing lmk.
Are you maybe glory rank heroic 3?
i'm valor heroic 3. not sure what 1450 glory corresponds to tho.
heroic 2 for glory. but it specifically says Valor rank Heroic. so i am confused why it isn't registering aha.
"Looking at the quest online I’d bet on it being glitched since the previous step was also heroic rank, so maybe see if it checks off when you get the next rank"
yeah it is probably glitched. figures haha. guess i'll just grind out the next rank before the raid then.
Hahaha in the raid you can ||push the third encounter boss off a cliff with smoke grenades|| excellent callback to ||vault of glass||
can we try that lol.
no need for those snipers now😂
"So, for those who have new raid exp... recommended light level/fast way to reach said level?"
if you're over 890 you're fine for first encounter. boss is recommended at 940.
so. essentially just doing your milestones that give powerful rewards.
"if you have the time start leveling another character for more min-max strategies. but not 100% necessary. also, ranking up in comp or Quickplay gives a pretty powerful reward."
Competitive crucible if you can get wins is a quickish way to get your power up after you do your milestones
so i would honestly recommend playing some crucible lol.
I’m at like 937 after comp and leveling hunter before Titan
But we had a guy in my run last night at 900 for the third encounter and he was doing good
i also don't think the crucible rank up powerfuls are limited to one. when i dropped a rank in comp then ranked up again after winning i still got a powerful drop for it.
every glory rank up is a powerful right now
no clue why
The only reason we didn’t get the clear is it was midnight and the ||motes team|| couldn’t figure it out
I'm not in a huge rush to complete the raid tbh. i have a ton of IRL stuff going on so if it takes me an extra week for leveling and learning I'm fine with that. I'm focusing on getting the Undying badge stuff i find the ritual weapons a grindddd lol.
I just want to move forward on the moon/ unlock vex offensive
I just want a jacket code
Plus I want to get undying and enlightened and they aware both so grindy
haha i respect it. I'm broke so i wouldn't get it anyway😂 if i end up in a group that completes it this week I'll happily give my code to someone.
Plus if I get the clear/experience it makes it easier to help out clan runs haha
enlightened I'm less worried about considering it's all raid related and the raid will always be there. but with undying it's seasonal so i want to get the grindy stuff out of the way asap.
"oh wait, undying is limited to this season and won't be obtainable after?"
"Correct, vex offensive is this season only"
"So you’ll need to do all the ritual weapon quests, and the shader/emblem quests"
are they long?
they are grindy yes.
"Crucible is, as expected, the worst of them"
"^
no surprise there"
what kind of grind is it?
yeah I'm about 40% overall done with Edgewise and i hadn't even curated my loadouts for it.
like complete vex offensive 100 times
or like slay 5000 vex
or idk
"complete the offensive, kill a bunch of stuff with different weapon types...defeat the bosses."
that doesnt sound horrible
yet
it's pretty standard and then there are also a couple for killing stuff on the moon using various subclass elements.
it really isn't a *hard* title...just super grindy.
"hmm, kill stuff on the moon is kind of annoying
there arent very many ads around"
"By far the worst part is the ritual weapons, and the only terrible one is crucible cause it’s all scout rifle kills"
not even mad tbh. jade rabbit is my child
farming lost sectors i would imagine would make the subclass kills easy.
"okay, I think i get the gist of it. it does sound sorta tedious but I think it could have been a lot worse"
i'm really really glad the pvp is scout kills and not something else
I'm almost done with my arc kills. void I'll do on my titan tho bc...melee kills haha.
because scouts are like all I use lol
Final blows is only annoying cause it’s a 6 person match made activity
I'm at 86% for my SMG multikills as well. I'm really just focusing on doing one weapon type at a time since it clearly progresses quickly that's after only 3 runs of vex offensive.
it also could be worth getting a full team of 6 together so people can let others farm out the kills.
These may be frustrating
"|| Rapid Assault: In the Vex Offensive, close the warp gate before 10 minutes elapse.
Precise Assault: In the Vex Offensive, close the warp gate before any gate node is activated.||"
how exactly does tgat work?
essentially just burn the boss into oblivion lol?
"I guess so, may want to group up for it lol"
"I also think the bosses rotate, so maybe it isn’t possible this week"
is vex offensive a 6 person activity?
yeah...kind of like for some menagerie triumphs getting a full group made it easier to coordinate.
It is yes
Warlock tickle fingers melts ads super hard
"I see, does the boss have any mechanics?"
or just a sponge
this week you have to break his shield using void craniums that drop from minotaurs.
then there's like a 20 second damage phase before he goes to the next area.
i do think a coordinated team with full heavy could melt him. last night my group of randos got him down to about a third health in the first phase.
The more people that are firing on it at one time the faster the shield breaks
I'll probably run it with a group then
I’m sure something like weapons of light rally barricade or Luna well Izanagis could destroy it
Seems like you could just delete him
"We've killed him in one phase pretty regularly, with melting point, bubble and izanagis"
and killing the boss closes the warp gate?
I haven't done vex offensive yet
yarp
"Yeah, again that’s assuming it’s possible on this boss and not the ||Undying Mind|| since it’s likely on a rotation"
Oh nvm it counts as closing just checked my cleats
so @@RonInDune  you should have that triumph then assuming it's possible on any boss. but if you don't then it's likely another boss.
I'm down to try one phasing today if people are on before the raid.
I think I do maybe
You have to get all the triumphs for season of Undying as well
So that gate lords eye power bonus is a grind
I'm trying to crank out the weapon and shader/emblem quests first.
"Oh yeah, apparently I heard that people got the day 1 emblem for completing between 10am and 12pm the next day due to the maintenance"
but also that during that time contest mode was turned off??
so that means some people got it without contest on?
how much power bonus do you need to get on the eye for the triumph? the max which is 15 right?
20
There is no max
so just hitting 20 then.
"is there even an efficient way to increase the levels you get from it? like, does xp earned from bounties help a lot maybe?"
So the guy that finished the season pass has a +13 on the gate lords eye
And his method was || The majority of my Exp (after Season Rank 50) came from Eris Bounties. I would buy as many as I could for 3k Glimmer and then head to the K1 Logistics Lost Sector to complete them. On a good run I could finish all 5. Delete Tidal Lock as it's trash... then repeat. It's very grindy but you get a level about every 3-5 Lost Sector runs.||
Garden of Salvation t-shirt:
tempted to do that exp grind on reading week
shred through the season ranks
I'm already at 26 or 27
I'm only at like 12 lol
been working and studying
"||1,400,000 exp to go from a +13 on gate lord to +14||"
Sitting at plus 6 power I believe
😭 i wish I had a fall reading week
yeah i think I'm +6 as well. I'll have to do that lost sector/bounty farm tho in between doing other stuff haha.
what's reading week?
study for exams.
ohhh
It definitely makes sense for the grind to increase  the grind past like +10
I only have 1 exam after reading week
at least at my university we have optional classes all week so...i just stay in and do nothing lmao.
we have an away trip during our reading week so i can't even have that full time since we're gone Thursday-sunday  :))))
i cannot wait to be done with this lmao.
"I try to not set midterms that require extensive revisions lol, mostly if you've attended class you'll muddle through"
I have midterms essays due in like 3 weeks and they're both 2-3 pages so not bad. but I've started to outline them now so i can just crank them out when I'm ready.
Hey @thegoaliebear your favorite just three manned Garden
Wait was it Gladd you didn’t like or Goth
Gladd.
Yeah it was him lol
i just hate his attitude.
not my vibe lmao.
anyone down for a quick heroic menagerie tonight?
i don't think I'll have time depending how long we go with the raid.
but if we just go for a couple hours i could do a heroic run after.
@Destiny [PC] i am hopping on now if anyone would like to join. i will just be doing pvp to make progress on the ritual weapon and quest for the emblem.
50% on those scout rifle kills...only 18% for medals and kills tho lmao rip.
"Just a heads up I may be *slightly* late because we're doing a birthday dinner for my niece, but it'll only be a couple minutes"
no worries.
@Matos what time for heroic? I need to do that.. haven’t yet.
"I don't think i'll be on tonight because i'm swamped in homework, assignments, and midterms atm"
"so the gambit quest is bugged as well. says reach ""Brave"" for the first step and i am past brave by now and it did not check off."
worked fine for me
i picked it up after tho i was already Guardian II.
so it might not be retroactive ?? but i doubt that
Insane suggestion. Try logging into ps4?
Maybe there's some weird desync with cross save
wow never thought of that. i am going to try that.
did not work :/
@Buttkikker did you pick up the quest after you had already reached rank brave tho?
aight fam let's get it. in Raid Alpha no rush when everyone is here we'll get it rolling.
@thegoaliebear I grabbed it as soon as the season dropped
oh so that's probably why.
Good luck guys! Don't forget to grab the Divinity quest before you start!
i progressed to the next pvp step when i was already at heroic II and it never popped retroactively for me. so it's definitely bugged.
and that really sucks lol.
"Hopefully reset fixes it, otherwise abandon the quest and pick it up again from Drifter"
yeah but will it reset my progress?
"It looks like it’s account wide, so I dunno if deleting would reset it"
are we doing the divinity quest? I can grab that if it only takes a sec otherwise I can get for next time
i believe you have to get it in one go of the raid?
Unless you can beat the raid you’ll just be wasting time lol
funnily enough we found some  of the secret rooms on our run
How do you get that quest?
ya that's what I thought after watching datto's vid
"It's fairly easy to do honestly, you can get most of it done in one vex offensive"
yeah it has to be one go of the raid so...no haha no need to have it yet.
and are meeting in orbit? i dont see anyone online
i'm on. send a steam friend request.
doing some misc quest things and I'll join up. stream has started
yeah so deleting the quest and reacquiring it didn't work. i'm gonna try and queue into a match and see tho.
this raid.....maybe not firing?
totally fine if not. will do some other memes
well i know ari said he might be a bit late.
im good just getting all equips ready 😄
"I'll be with y'all shortly, I just have to finish up an email and I'll be on"
also @thegoaliebear what was ur steam?
thegoaliebear
thaaats right
I am home and will be online in just a couple minutes
"I love collector, I feel bad for the enemy team though."
love that for you haha.
@thegoaliebear try dc and rc
@ruGGed_koala @the_drake1997 in Raid Alpha voice channel.
How goes the raid?
@Crizum we got the first two encounters down real easy now. gonna go at it tomorrow and hopefully learn the third and get to the boss.
"if not, we will have the checkpoint to work on throughout the week!"
Cool
@Destiny [PC] would people be interested in a Divinity run/final boss learning run this upcoming Saturday? Possibly thinking of starting around daily reset if enough people are down
"Down to help, but I wouldn't be available until the evening. Although I think you'll definitely have more than enough people, so it shouldn't be a worry"
"I know there were some people asking around about it, so hopefully"
if i aint busy with school i'd be down
but once the end of october comes ill have a shitload of freetime
so i'd definitely be able to raid by then
yeah i have a game so wouldn't be free until evening time unfortunately.
@Elite1v41230 in here is where we do all our PC talk aha.
"10-4 @thegoaliebear , thanks!"
no problem !
"for those in the raid run tonight (and anyone really), here's a full guide to look at the third and boss encounters. Honestly, as much as we meme about Kackis...i do recommend his video for the last couple encounters he does a real good job explaining it.
https://www.pcinvasion.com/destiny-2-shadowkeep-garden-of-salvation-full-raid-guide/"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froVY9nlLCc
@Crizum Is this a KWTD situation?
Or more Sherpa like
"I’m 100% good with teaching what I know of the encounters, only real request is light level 930+ for the final encounter"
But even that’s negotiable lol
"Oof 930. I'm currently 922. Should I stay signed up in hopes i'll make it, or leave my slot open?"
KWTD+minimum 8 clears+must have Gjallarhorn
@RonInDune dont forget petras run
"With weekly reset today of all powerfuls, i'm sure i'll grow a lot"
"Reset today so those should put you close, plus drops for the first few encounters should help too"
"Okay cool, i'll stay in the group then. I'm free for that time slot 👌"
Awesome!
I'll get close to that level by Saturday
And @RonInDune you gotta have the Gjallarhorn catalyst too
Only Ron though
I've seen a few people say on reddit that the mechanics can be a little much but the raid itself is actually pretty easy going
so i'm not too worried
Must have done Zero Hour using Guitar Hero controller only
"Yeah the first two encounters are super chill, the third gets a little more hectic but it’s still not terrible. Most issues I’ve seen are people getting killed because of being like 900-910"
Did exotics in D1 have catalysts?
No haha
Innnnteresting
i have about an hour before class i am just doing public events for the Undying triumph.
if the severs hold up lmao nevermind.
wow can't go 5 seconds without getting contacting servers.
Are they doing maintenance?
there is an update i already updated tho aha.
maybe i have to log back in.
Ugh hate it when it runs slow
andddd there's a queue LOL
nice I thought i would only experience this once this season
hoping they fixed that quest bug aha.
Quest bug?
hoping they fixed le monarque quest too
yeah in the pvp and gambit quests if you reached the rank required on a certain step it wouldn't count it retroactively.
"so i was at Heroic II valor when I got the next step of ""reach valor rank heroic"" i got to Heroic III and it never checked it off."
same thing with the gambit ranks.
It probably doesn’t count sub ranks?
Try to get the next named rank and see
i would if the game wasn't unavailable rn hahaha.

:dudeweak:
Imagine if they had to rollback the servers 1 week 😄
i think the servers going down was Bungie's way of telling me to study.
During my time we actually studied before we played games 🤓
That’s literally never been true
The amount of study was close to 0
haha my 1230 got cancelled so i had so much time after practice. got my work done. but it wasn't enough for bungo 😩
But we studied before we played games 😉
@thegoaliebear its back up
30 mins before i have to go haha.
"@Crizum Do you agree with this loadout recommendations?
<https://old.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/ddrbh5/garden_of_salvation_guide_and_megathread/>
Cause if so ~~i'll need to hunt for izanagi's~~"
"Yeah those are all solid choices, Izanagi’s cannot be recommended enough and recluse pairs incredibly well. However if you’re at or above the right light level you have some leeway in what you run with"
"A lot of the encounters is ad clearing, so whatever you’re comfortable with"
"i never bothered with izanagis. but if you have whisper and even darci will do nicely. so no need to worry about IB being a ""must have"""
"I got Recluse and MT, but I've been loving Riskrunner lately"
"Yeah the main perk about izanagi is it does massive damage, pairs with recluse, and leaves a spot open for a grenade launcher for the bigger ads"
But for some of the encounters I was running Monte Carlo on sentinel Titan punching everyone for almost 100% overshield uptime
"@Lonk It's not on that list there, but I'm gonna go ahead and recommend threat level. I found it very helpful for some of the encounters"
Aw man I want monte so bad
Threat Level + Recluse got me thru lots
Threat Level over the EP Shotgun?
"the good thing about the weapon buffs overall is that you can make a lot of things work. there's really no ""oh you must have this to be successful."" sure some weapons make the job easier, but there's a lot of viable stuff out there."
I'd do threat level yeah. so you can pair recluse with it.
Recluse is just too strong so it kinda makes it hard to recommend a different weapon in the slot
"Oh right, same slot"
"Thing is, you can't run EP and recluse together"
Recluse with anti-barrier rounds in it can also go through the Angelics shields
yeah...recluse is just too good haha.
"Anti-barrier is busted, you can just chew through hobgoblins even when they go to heal"
i put an overload mod on recluse and anti barrier on breakneck and that pairing did some hella work during the encounters last night.
"crap, don't have it yet feelsbad"
If you have mountaintop that also works
"that's fine, there are other good kinetic shotguns"
i think i prefer sg over mt for some encounters
Oh yeah! The new moon shotgun can roll with one-two punch and you can farm it on the moon
"||those minotaurs in the second and third encounter chase you around, so with MT you'd blow yourself up a lot||"
"*oof* my #1 enemy is self destruction, lol."
and #2 is wide pits 😅
"If you can’t get a scourge in try for one small step, it maybe isn’t the best roll but I have a QuickDraw/1 2 punch roll and I’m liking it"
"@thegoaliebear I like your loadout, because I used that pretty much constantly last season. Minus the mods ofc"
yeah i'll try for a scourge run before saturday
Go with @RonInDune cause he cursed me to like 4 of those shotguns
yeah honestly...you can do work with a lot of weapons now haha. but the breakneck/recluse combo serves really well. i also used the moon machine gun and that turned out to be really nice for angelics and mobs in the second encounter.
breakneck 👀
"actually, we're all meta slaves. we should break out of the cycle and make a statement"
equip traveler's chosen (damaged)
run sidearms and swords
Swords in PvE and PvP
it's the way to go
Anyone who says swords are bad gets dabbed on repeatedly
(hint hint @Oathbreaker )
Gotta kill me first before you can dab on me
Also
*SWORDS ARE BAD*
They're pretty good for Vex Invasion as they constantly stun the bosses
I'm gonna try and hop on before our raid to rank up in valor and see it that fixes the thing on the pvp quest.
worldline zero best exotic don't @ me
"@Trissin Anarchy, Wardcliff, ||Deathbringer||, Bad Juju, ||Divinity||, Thorn, Last Word, Tractor Cannon, 1K, Thunderlord all say hello"
Forgetting a few likely
Ugh i'm so excited to get Divinity when we successfully finish Saturday 👌
"cos spoilers:
|| hey @Oathbreaker using which of those exotics can u do this
https://youtu.be/G4mLgFQhC7c
||"
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1181636215176433664
Thank you Bungie
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT TECH LMAOOO
THAT CLIP
swords best
IS HILARIOUS
THAT'S SOME TITANFALL TECH
the right move by bungie tbh. a 24 hr emblem should be a 24 hr emblem regardless of what happens. if they had communicated it prior to the 24 hr period being over then it would have been fine.
but imagine being a team that cleared it at like 25 hrs and having the emblem snatched back💀😂😂
I thinkn the main thing is because contest mode was deactivated
"Teams clearing garden without contest on, and getting the emblem"
that really defeats the significance of having it
Hmm why have I been kicked from the clan?
you're still on the roster.
wat destiny says I'm not 😄
could be more wonky stuff going on
o_O
oh I had to restart destiny
Any fans of bows here? Been running with a bow a lot lately and I’m kind of addicted.  I was going after Le Monarque but the new quest from Ada is busted (legend weapon frames forged aren’t counting towards quest).  Anyone have monarque/use it much?
"I was addicted to whichever the electric bow is last season, rocking that thing a lot"
"monarque is **great**, i love it."
but this season I haven't really busted them out yet. I will be soon for the Offensive triumph
😓
"bows are not really in a good spot, and I don't think I would use them for any competitive activity really"
but they are a lot of fun
"if you like bows, hush is probably worth the grind
that's a really nice bow"
"I need a bow so bad, don’t have one"
isn't that the one that's better to not be ads with?
a 'hip fire' bow
I remember getting almost destroyed in a comp game with a bow user couple of days ago
"@thegoaliebear and @Crizum managed to get the better of them just by rushing and closing the distance immediately, so that's the biggest problem with bows"
"ty for the tip on hush, i'll  check it out 🙂 and yeah using bows at short range is a bad time..."
"i whip out riskrunner when the gap is closed, usually manage to widen it back fairly quickly"
Jeez @Lonk just how many runs in vex offensive do you have lol
So many.. so.. so many
I really want the undying title so I’m grinding those triumphs hard
@Trissin Trinity ghoul would like to have a word with you
_ew_ Trinity ghoul
I don't like it
*gasp*
feels too slow for me
Isn’t that just risk runner but bad?
>:C
Leviathans Breath looks interesting
Like it’s gonna make crucible even more hellish lol
nice to know it's 500 kills each for that vex offensive triumph lol. i'm almost done with SMGs and Autos.
"@thegoaliebear challenging enemies grant bonus progress too, so any yellow or orange bars count for more"
oh nice that's probs why my auto rifle went up so quickly last night. just a couple runs and i'm at like 60% aha.
:o auto rifle kills
might be time to pull out that Sweet business
yayaya.
Already got the catalyst done too
It’s pretty nice now
i just kept breakneck on but i should try SB for the memes.
"actually, I'll do my Cerberus catalyst"
trinity ghoul would be a good option for getting that triumph in vex offensive tho. Its real good for ad-clear
I used that for getting Hush as well in gambito
neat. i like the Offensive triumphs making me use stuff i normally wouldn't aha. it's been pretty fun.
"Sweet, got Monte Carlo, also got two wavesplitter drops last night which seemed excessive."
dang nice
"speaking of bow's, we'll be getting the leviathan's breath quest soon ™"
<https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dezpaj/gos_interestingly_the_last_boss_is_easier_if_you/>
Oct 22.
if the steps are true...its very easy haha.
"yeah I agree, unless the ||strike|| is on ||thorn level|| 😰"
haha yeah i think that is more frustrating than hard per say. a good team will see something like that done in maybe 30-45mins max.
depends on what the modifiers end up being tho haha.
can't wait to start making builds around Nightstalker. going full add management haha.
Anybody wanna run for 100k in Ordeal?
if only i wasn't in class lol.
Same for work
do you have a third?
"btw, I believe you have to run it on the 950 difficulty or higher to score 100k
just letting you know!"
"Yeah, when I ran the 920 we killed everything and finished in about 12 minutes on pyramidion and only hit about 84k"
"Yeah, highest I got on the pyramidion 920 was like 89k."
"And you can't reset zones by wiping either, it'll just subtract the score you earned"
"Even if you try to get like ability kills as often as you can, there just aren't enough adds to push it over 100k"
sucks that 100k doesn't count for regular nightfalls now as a powerful reward.
I think that's fair. 100k on regular nightfall was a little too easy
What's the nightfall this week?
It’s the only non-raid thing to get you to 960
It’s a pinnacle reward so it makes sense
i believe the ordeal is scarlet keep
That's what I've heard as well
the legend/mastery levels should be pinnacle gear but i think a 100k regular could have still given a normal powerful reward maybe cap it at 940 or something.
Like a tier 1 for doing a five of swords run? Yeah that could have worked
yeah exactly.
Honestly feels more doable now that gear isn't locked
it just feels weird not doing them now haha.
Or is it locked on higher levels?
ordeal nightfalls lock gear at 950+
bc literally regular nightfalls serve no purpose now aside from if you want to get the NF exclusive item.
I mean with the direction they're taking the game I don't mind that
For example
if you're me
You'll be found in the Hallowed Lair strike for the next week
Non-stop
fucking Mindbenders
yeah I was about to say I really want the DFA handcannon and the one Sniper rifle I can't remember that's really good for noobs
way to easier to actually grind now
the long goodbye?
or silicon neuroma
The one you get from insight terminus
Long Goodbye isn't really a good entry into snipers
I have good sole survivor with opening shot/snapshot sights that I really like so far
"has the weird chevron sight, has an *okay* zoom, not great stats, and chances of getting a good roll aren't great, so you're kinda wasting time farming it instead of something like Beloved, or Twilight Oath, or Supremacy, or even using Alone as a god"
That roll is definitely good
I don't like Sole Survivor but that roll is just so good
"not as popular as those you listed, but i like the frigid jackal"
"although I also don't really snipe, so it could just be a me thing"
"Frigid is okay. 45 zoom from what I remember, has Quickdraw too so"
Beloved does feel *very* satisfying to use somehow
"Mind you, a LOT of things about sniping is just down to feel"
"I could go home right now, pick up my Twilight Oath and go slay out with it despite not using it for 3-4 months on feel alone"
"My twilight oath was PvE roll I think, with box breathing and something else"
But the zoom on that felt weird somehow
Whereas something like my Supremacy takes a good day or two to get accustomed to it because it feels too lightweight
"It's 35 zoom, lowest in the game"
i used a box breathing/firmly planted Beloved for my revoker steps. wasn't too bad and now i am forced back into pvp for Undying :)))
"If I have a rampage or kill clip on a sniper, can I bodyshot people?"
Not on 90rpms
"On 72s, yes"
"oh actually you know what, that reminds me"
I recently picked up a bow with no distractions and moving target
"Get good at double kills with scouts goal, cause those steps for randy are stupid"
Tatara is the only one that can roll Kill Clip
i'm at 54% for scout kills and only like 18% for kills and medals. it's brutal.
A million percent out of whack with the gambit and vanguard steps and I don’t even understand why lol
**jade rabbit**
Jade Rabbit or Polaris Lance
deadass why did they make the pvp one so ridiculous.
probably bc they have to get people into the playlists somehow
Is it as bad as mountaintop?
"I don’t think they communicated the quest well, apparently the best method for medals is cold fusion?"
i will try anything to make that shit go faster lol.
I mean the people who play pvp on average are gonna go into pvp willingly
@RonInDune nothing is as bad as mountaintop
"Also Oath I do have a kill clip Tatara Gaze but I've literally never used it in PvP, might try it out then"
"Tatara has a shit scope, that's the only thing Ron"
i dont like the zoom of tatara
Boxy and zoomed WAY in
im not tryna use a microscope here
"I kinda feel people don’t like playing PvP, they like stomping in PvP"
Maybe it'll be useful in the new map
disagree Crizum
It’s a subtle difference
Though scout flinch is brutal
@Crizum i like sbmm
I don't enjoy stomping unless I'm meme'ing with friends
"Oh I like it now, but it gets bad at the end of the season"
i enjoy getting a crucible quest done so i don't have to play it for the rest of the season.
See I just enjoy PvP.
"Cause the amount of six stack mindbenders or NF, dust rock etc you run in to in quickplay was disheartening to learn"
i respect that. i will always think it's hot garbage tho.
"Yeah towards the end of last season I was not having fun anymore, but otherwise I like using weird weapons and trying to have fun"
"""trying"" key word 😉"
I literally never see a 6 stack anymore lol
Not saying they don't exist
really? all the matches i played the other day had at least a 4 stack in them.
"I’m having more fun this season, but you can’t tell me there isn’t a sizable amount of players who hit their legend rank, get unbroken, and just proceed to pubstomp quickplay instead of doing comp"
Well yeah? There's no incentive to play comp anymore
Now that classic mix is it’s own thing I’m interested in seeing how it shakes out
Yeah apparently people got to Unbroken really fast this season
I think they tweaked scoring
It took 95% of the Sherpas in the PvP improvement Discord I'm in 3 or 4 days to reach legend
Right but what’s the incentive to play quickplay over comp? Six stacking pub stomps or just countdown being countdown?
"The other 5% took another day or two, and the last remaining outlier is me just because I focus on school"
Countdown is gone as a mode
i don't enjoy pvp. being with at least one other person makes it more tolerable but not by much. i do mildly enjoy stacking in comp when we're getting wins. but otherwise...nah.
Oh really? Thank god
Comp is only 3v3 survival
I really didn't enjoy countdown
like literally nothing will make me enjoy pvp. never did in D1 either.
"This is all last season I’m talking about mainly, this season so far my only complaint is how frustrating the randys quest is for the Undying title lol"
We should have clan pvp + gambit again
And before the reason to play QP over Comp was finding matches quicker
I actually really enjoyed that
Comp would take 30min+ at times to find a match
you might enjoy it too @thegoaliebear
"Yeah I couldn't join in last time, but I'm in for clan night again"
and i wouldn't mind this scout weapon quest if the medals/kills weren't so ridiculously *not* tuned at all to the other steps.
Bungie may end up tweaking it
Wait and see if you guys want
Focus on other stuff
i mean...it actually is ridiculous.
Don't burn yourself out
how many scout kills is it
"like I said, communicated poorly on the quest. Double kills with scouts give like 100 points for medals?"
yeah literally wtf LOL.
okay 450 is a bit high
goddamn
Bungie and wording things well? What universe are you guys living in
if i'm at 54% on scout kills alone...you should probably be around 35-40% for medals/kills if it's tuned properly.
but it's not.
so it's awful.
"Not disagreeing that it's a shit quest, mind you"
For reference here’s Gambit
lol its like the sunshot catalyst
get 500 kills with the gun and 1k kills with the ~~sunshot~~ sunblast perk
Which is actually dumb lmao
the gambit isn't bad at all and it is a nicely tuned weapon quest tbh. requires a decent enough grind but not too crazy.
why does it even list 500 kills as a requirement when the ~~sunshot~~ sunblast kills are harder to get and count towards kills anyways
i only played two matches the other day and already at 80 multikills.
yeah the tuning is definitely weird
"It’s just so disheartening to relatively pop off for my skill level, go 30+ kills and see like a 1% increase if I’m lucky"
"and medals aren't hard to come by in gambit or pvp, so it's kind of weird how much more the pvp requires. but then again...bungo."
I got exit strategy already lol
oh crap
how is it
its pretty cool
I just got a gold medal for wiping the entire enemy team but it’s worth less than a double kill with fusions? How?
"Which is understandable, it's a shitty quest to try and grind"
"if they want to keep the 14,000 for medals/kills, then make teammates contribute."
but how does it _feel_ @Buttkikker
does it look cool in your hands and sound good when it shoots
Who knows Crizum? Unless Bungie devs speak out on it we won't know how it tracks exactly
We can extrapolate some information but we can't say for sure
also *several people are typing*
"lol @Buttkikker is literally the fastest to pinnacle weapons everytime, congrats dude!"
"From my searching all I can find it double kills give more progress, scout doubles the most, but you have to be the final blow on each kill but it’s all theory"
i just found it funny that *of course* the pvp weapon turned out to be the grindy-est
Im a big fan so far feels nice and it's got swashbuckler which is nice
the only downside is its slowish reload time
is it kinetic or energy? can't remember.
but to be fair ive been using outlaw on the vex invasion smg
kinetic
ooh...i like to see it haha.
it seems really good based on the stats
and the perks
almost like a ~~primary~~ kinetic recluse
the only reason i went with swashbuckler is the overload mod
honestly yeah i am going to break from the pvp weapon for a bit and just get the gambit and vanguard weapons aha.
otherwise surrounded/surrounded spec would be the way to go i think
"^
thats what I was thinking,yeah"
though i cant decide between threat detector and underdog
i'm about 55% overall done with Edgewise so...that's not too bad and exit strategy will definitely go quick.
Threat detector gives reload speed right?
i would probably go threat detector
yeah but so does underdog
unless you find yourself in those risky situations often
i guess it depends on playstyle
Threat detector procs more at the range you’d use the smg in PvE I feel
i think with the melee incentive of swashbuckler underdog might be the way to go but again not sure
"Threat Detector has more uptime in comparison to Underdog, especially with an SMG. You want to get close but you really don't want to be low health in PvE so"
That's my take on it at least
Using Ophidian Aspect with enhanced smg loader on a swashbuckler smg is very very good
Especially on a devour warlock
yeah that would be kinda ridiculous
you can literally never die
When I don’t have to use a scout I may try an exit strategy/recluse/peacekeepers build for a bit
Just be zoomie
and with devour threat detector would be better no doubt
yup devour is always so good
I've 1v4ed in comp last season while running devour and it was broken
"I lost for sure, but I lost gloriously"
Devour is great if you can chain the kills
Unfortunately the rest of the subclass is ass for PvP
yeah that's true
wait @Crizum i just looked on braytech at the pvp quest and it says 2/3 for Heroic rank earned. so i think you're correct about having to reach the next valor rank for it to count maybe.
but it doesn't have the same deal for the gambit Brave rank.
For the second shader?
the emblem for pvp.
"Oh yeah, it may cause I’m on the quest before it and I am listed at 2 for valor rank heroic"
So they probably mean whatever rank is after heroic
Burnished Blade it says 2/3 Valor rank Heroic earned. so yeah.
just weird it doesn't show that way on the gambit one.
i will have to rank that one up to the next group too and see if it works.
"but for Edgewise it's 1,000 machine gun kills so loading into a nightfall solo and farming lost sectors probably works well."
is edgewise any good though?
idk but i need it for Undying so i gotta.
like would you use it over hammerhead/delirium?
my guess is probably not haha. but it is nice to probably keep since it's solar.
i know Fixed Odds is solar as well but i will have to see how Edgewise handles compared.
oh hell
it looks to be an objectively worse 21%
"i completely forgot about fixed odds, immediately thought of avalanche lol"
||Raid sniper is a 140rpm with No Distractions/Snapshot on a 40 zoom scope||
"hmmm actually @Buttkikker idk, it seems like it might actually be pretty good"
^^ GoS gear spoiler just in case someone is curious
speaking of fixed odds. i should grab that from menagerie and use it for edgewise steps haha.
"same rpm, smaller mag, and rampage seems like worse killing tally"
"yeah, i've been using avalanche lol"
im thinking about demolitionist and field prep
for infinite grenades
"not infinite, but like a **lot**"
personally id prefer demo on a primary
more uptime on the gun
thats fair
so edgewise also has light mag on it.
which is nice.
tho im not sure if its the same amount of grenade regen
will probably be something to use for fun in vex offensive or something.
Get an Austringer with Demolitionist if you really want a demolitionist primary
though tbh ive been in love with smgs lately
i love dropping a fat tether and then running and gunning with recluse. been having a blast in vex offensive and menagerie with that. was also fun in that second raid encounter.
Did they tweak tether a bit? It seems to be more reliable now
i am not sure i'll have to look at the patch notes for shadowkeep again.
i will have to try bottom tree out in team activities especially vex offensive. seems like nice buffs/changes.
You like arc in PvP right?
Go be a bully and use the overshield on arc abilities mod from the gate eye with that helmet that heals you when you dodge
Striker titans can combine it with the rally barricade and oem to always have shields
Season engam reward!
congrats
i've only been seeing they've been getting duplicate armor
so i was definetly sweatin' opening it lol
"Not sure if this has been shared here yet:
https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/253859859"
@Oathbreaker & other pvp players
holy shit
a man just trying depositing a charge in an already dispelled thing in the scarlet keep strike for a full minute
Anyone up for grinding through insight terminus for the sniper rifle?
i will be closer to 915 for this just got home have to take care of a couple things first!
but very much looking forward to those spicy powerful drops😄
Some of the new shaders are dope
Some of the newer stuff in r/DestinyFashion look gorgeous
"this hunter, for instance:"
aye yo confused here
"i'm in the clan as [wi] ""We'll get it this time""
But my buddy just joined and his is [WI] ""We will get it this time"""
"youre in the ps4 clan, hes in the pc one"
dangit
They're our evil twin
Everyone has goatees
"I switched platforms, I guess I missed that step, lol"
yeah you can just send a request to the PC clan whenever you'd like if you'll be playing primarily/exclusively on PC now.
"I can send the request while in ps4 clan, or I need to leave and have no clan, then send request?"
leave  and then join
"ah that stinks, I think that will put me on clan cooldown and not give weekly rewards"
"yeah, id wait until you have the stuff from this week"
"Hey anyone get stuck in an endless loop of ""Destiny 2 server not available""?"
That’s sick @RonInDune
i know its kinda last minute anyone trying to hop into garden get a cp started?
dont have to finish at all
I believe there's actually a group in there rn lol
So I dunno if there will be enouch people available to form a second rn
all good i found an lfg
but I think Crizum's in the process of forming a team this saturday on reset
Season pass machine gun is kinda nutty
"Hey, anyone wanna do a raid? The last wish?"
Omg so many raiders in our clan now! great!
If we had 6 for last wish I wouldn't mind a run through
"Nice, so tihs makes 3 anyone else wanna get in on this?"
"Oh no, sorry @Rox but I'm not available to raid tonight"
I'm just glad there are so many people who here who want to do the raids
"Understandable. I'm just trying to find some people to play with. Not just the raids but PVP, PVE and Gambit as well."
That mainly for the people from tonight?
yeah but i don't think someone will be able to make it so we will need a sixth.
I’ll join up but if they show I can step out lol
haha awesome.
Anyone  gonna do some Gambit or Crucible?
i am currently making progress on Vex Offensive triumphs.
"Damn, haven't gotton to the moon yet. Kinda playing through the campaigns one at a time. Just got done with osiris."
"nice! don't push yourself too quickly, I find the campaign gets quite repetitive and boring if you just speedrun those missions one after the other"
"Yeah, i'm having a blast with PVP and Gambit."
"Quick question, where is Hawthorne?"
She should be in the tower at the bazaar
just finished the raid guys so excited to get my raid jacket
group i was with was so calm and collected took us just over an hour. gotta love that first time you beat a new raid
nice!! congrats!
final boss took us 4 tries we had a 960 with us that really helped with all the chaos
"@Trissin  thanks, found her. She legit wasn't there before."
"damn, only 4 tries? that's real impressive"
"glad to hear ur run went smoothly, it's always nice raiding with an organized group"
2nd encounter only took us 1 try that was awesome
on my day 1 2nd encounter took 6 hours
"lool yeah it was pretty hectic, i think my team spent a good like 3 or 4 hours on it as well"
is it just me or does it feel like the regular nightfall scales up to your light level
i tried doing hollowed lair 2 man and it was surprisingly difficult even though its 820 recommended and we are both 925
"Yeah, I felt something similar when I tried running the Insight Terminus solo."
i was hoping to 2 man farm for a mindbender but i guess i cant
atleast not quickly

Mods for armor 2.0
73% for solar kills and 52% for machine gun kills and i will be done with Edgewise lol.
still at 60% on void/grenade kill for the first shader tho. that one is more of a grind.
oh but @Spitfire2266 congrats on the raid completion that's awesome!
Hmm. I can't join :(
Did you `!register` ?
Yeap.
I had to re register after Steam
He's working in another server.. Wont even reply to my search command here
!lfg search raid
:idk:
love that. if you'd like to join for sure tonight I'll remember tho aha @Kit
"Yeah, I signed up. @Ransom  too"
!lfg join 671 @Kit
yeah guess warmind doesn't wanna cooperate rn.
but I'll remember you two are in. so I'll just @ you when we're all getting together.
A'ite.
I’ll be running Titan tonight and likely Hunter Saturday unless something happens with my warlock
Always warlock for me :)
Last night I screwed over a hunter so bad I had to laugh about it
Activated ward of dawn and the second I hit the third person view I see them jump for the tether
cool. we had the mechanics down clearly and got to damage phase several times. but we just had some issues with our boss team getting across those jumping puzzles sometimes and had too many deaths.
I’m good on gambit team or eyes
Across the jumping puzzle? You mean the part where you pick up his voltaic and shoot the eyes?
the jumping area with the rotating platforms gave them trouble
Hm. I don't remember seeing a part with rotating platforms. I'll have to re-watch the video
The copper cylinder area
yeah from the trailer
I just don't recall seeing it during that fight
we were efficient with the motes tho. we did 5-10-10-5 and that worked out well for us as far as speed went. if we didn't have the deaths we could have gotten it bc a couple damage phases it was only the motes team at the beacon for it lol.
lmaooo okay warmind.
Go home Warmind you’re drunk
Looks like he caught up
love to see that.
Someone photoshop rasputin on slowpokes face
"also, we need to rename the raid LFG to Vault of Grass"
no longer GoS
this is true.
How were you guys taking down the eyes in the detained part?
Just letting the detained take them out with a sniper?
we had one person on the left and right of detained person. detained calls out inner or outer and each person shoots their eye.
I was watching some peeps 3 man it and he just popped the 3 reds with a snip
1 shot per eye
"That’s how I’ve been doing if, or if people can’t make it in time snipe it"
if each person in the boss team tonight feels comfortable doing that then for sure can go that method.
we will most likely be quick enough with the motes as well so we won't have to swap someone to pick up a 4th voltaic.
Biggest killer in my runs has been those stupid supplicants
yeah we had some deaths to those as well. I think we just have to remember to keep on the pillars and jumping around aha.
Oki i re-watched the vid. I see the twirly part now lol
Just on the way to get the voltaic
Anywho I'm gucci with whatever role ya wanna toss me in.
"goal and i were on mote team, but i had to sub into grab a voltaic a couple times. was able to pop at least 2 with recluse."
yeah i think if we can eliminate deaths on voltaic team we won't have to swap in. we were prettt quick getting the motes in.
I might try DARCI for damage as well. see how it compares to whisper
Izanagi did work in boss phase for me
Im thinking DARCI
SHAXX MAKES SCORCH CANNON EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECTS
whisper did good damage but it was way too inconsistent getting that reload back.
DARCI has more bullets to fire and being on hunter can just auto reload dodge
it hits freakin hard too
I think the speed of the shots should help get damage out quickly
I would recommend izanagi
yeah for sure. i like how it handles a bit more too. so...definitely gonna infuse that up haha.
That's what my group used for encounter 3 on day 1
for the most part
"did better damage than whisper, darci, etc"
"Trissin, you need to remember that i nearly quit the game during black armory."
due to the 1KV bullshit rng.
I was gonna say why not both? But remembered that it's both exotic
Worship at the church of the weeb weapon
then probably darci yeah
My sole problem with Izanagi is totally a me thing but I usually run mountaintop for add clear and sometimes I’ll switch to that slot and waste a honed edge x5
and after i found out you need to do rare BA bounties for izanagis which also require rng i was just like yeah I'm never gonna do that.
okay so hold tf up
rare bounties are not actually rng from what I heard
They drop from turning in her normal bounties
Idk if its RNG or based on how many you turn in
they drop from turning in something like 25 or 30 of her normal bounties in a single week
but it's a set number
of dailies
Theres no way its that much
turned in a week
that's almost worse
if its that many
I've never done more than the required 8 bounties for her weekly
yeah...still won't do it haha. I'm not worried about old content at this stage. been doing just fine without that.
And it dropped for me still
"It could be that it’s a random chance that gets higher the more you turn in, capping at like 25-30"
Oi at least you can also do shattered throne all the time now too lol. My clan mate finally got the bounty to drop the night before reset on full curse week
"Yeah, you're probably right @Crizum  - that makes the most sense"
"that's not too bad, but also the CoS stats show avg full run to be 1hr12min.. and that's vastly under what it took our team lol"
More stats broken down by weapons used and checkpoints <https://warmind.io/analytics/raid/garden-of-salvation>
"You’d be surprised, I’ve been in terrible runs that take hours"
"A MT, Recluse, Wendingo wambocombo"
But also vault of grass isn’t terrible to run
"I'm surprised Riskrunner is 1%, I saw so many streamers using it opening day I figured that would influence it's usage higher"
"I think they used it cause they were underleveled and the arc resistance was super helpful at that level, and less so once tips and tricks were found out"
i think riskrunner would be really good especially as you start making builds around subclass elements.
man...i am gonna get my work done so quick tonight so i can grind out more for edgewise lol. getting so close.
"reminder, what's edgewise?"
vanguard ritual weapon. machine gun
Ohhhh right
~~haven't started~~
it's not too bad. I'm almost done with it.
"*cough* 👀 
<https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dch9cr/edgewise_is_not_a_good_machine_gun/f2862nw/>"
That makes me sad since I don't have 21% either
Idk I think it's gonna be good
mmm 21% is great tho. IMO anyway.
A 900 rpm mg with demolitionist
I think thats strong
I'll have to try it out and compare to 21%
i just loaded into insight terminus nightfall and farming the artifacts edge lost sector.
wait wat
for edgewise
Edgewise comes with rampage.. not demolitionist
Or is it selectable?
"Comes with both, and you choose"
Ah ok lol
"I dunno tho, that overflow perk on 21% is so gucci"
Ohhh I only need 40 more primeval kills for 21%
getting over 200 rounds in the mag is so nice
that's true lol
and no loading when picking up ammo
i just like that it's solar.
i used to have a god roll bane of sorrow that i accidentally dismantled
Is there a 900 rpm void that isn’t temporal clause?
i don't think so. there really aren't a whole lot of machine guns in the game lol. so tbh I'm glad Edgewise is there to at least add some more diversity to the weapon class.
also i do have a hard stop around 1030 for the raid tonight. gotta be up hella early tomorrow💀
Uhhhhhhhhh soooo no room for tonight? Awkward
i don't remember you saying you'd be available? maybe i confused with someone else?
I was pushing for 8 and we compromised at 8:30....i can’t do weekend
"So ya, hate to do this but anyone who signed up for tonight who was not part of the run-through earlier, would love to switch out as I didn't realize we'd have an lfg and was working so could not sign up. Also not available this weekend, so I'd like to get these encounters done with this group."
@Crizum @Kit ^ if one of you wouldn't mind. my mistake as i had confused the people who wouldn't be able to make it tonight.
"Yeah that’s fine, said I would when I joined haha, just let me know if anyone else doesn’t show up"
@Crizum ty ty ❤
"Np, get the clear lol"
gl to you saturday
"I’ll probably be braving lfg for a clear, Saturday is Divinity with the clan haha"
ooo divinity. I need to do that too
"I think there are still some spots, when I search lfg it isn’t showing though"
"also thanks, Criz. Just got home and saw this."
click the arrow
"Ah yeah there we go, still a spot for Saturday"
i would join but unfortunately i have a 3pm game.
"I'd join, but tis in the middle of the day. Prolly gonna be skateboarding. Its supposed to be really nice out this weekend"
If there's one later in the day/evening i'll join up
done!
niiiice
look at this guys name omgggg
OH MY GOD THATS FUCKING HILARIOUS!!!!!!
"So, I've been unable to play Destiny since just before the Raid launch. Is anyone available to show me what's new/play a little crucible (since it's apparently the best way to raise light)?"
Anyone wanna help my cousin and i get the whisper of the worm real quick?
"@link270 I'm no longer in the clan, but I'd be more than happy to. Add the following friend code on steam: 107833059"
"Okay, is Vex offensive broken or something? It won't let me launch even after having Ikora's quest"
Do I need to kill vex for her elsewhere?
Yeah any Vex I think
Did you do the mission for it first?
have it all figured out thanks to Ari
"damn, just got anteater on my last game before fabled."
finally got recluse
welcome to the meta slaves brother
Looking to do a 100k nightfall maybe around 3-5 est today if anyone is interested
"@thegoaliebear @Peronix @Arixama @Crizum @Buttkikker 
For tonight's run - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQbsLr5vn0"
"Clutched out a clear at 2am , that fight has the possibility to get real hectic"
i don't think it'll be that hard. if we all watch the video and are on the same page I'm sure we'll be able to crank it out tonight. i also don't have pregame skate tomorrow morning so now i can stay up later if needed.
but I'll be getting on right after class pretty much to do some milestones and hopefully gain some extra levels.
"All people have to do is their role, and they have to avoid “helping”"
"It’s not helping to pre-shoot ||tethers, because I’m trying to bank motes and kill shields, oh thanks now I can’t shoot and get to watch helplessly as goblins steal motes||"
yeah and if we want once people watch the fight we can see if people would be more comfortable doing certain roles. like last night our two teams in the third encounter we got really comfortable and flowed real well in our roles.
"It’ll be way easier with a group that communicates lol, the win I got was because someone calm joined and talked everything through"
well we definitely have a chill group haha. so i don't think we'll run into any trouble as far as communication goes.
will just be more of people getting used to the mechanics and flow of the encounter.
just reposting this here as well.
so technically by November 19 you can have Undying😄
Oh god I think I’d rather have had flawless be one of the requirements for Enlightened over what we have in phase 4
uhhh yeah LOL
||kill 20 vex with the platforms you build||
the triumphs for that title are all kinds of wacky doodle
Also ||anyone with motes can’t kill things|| in third phase
tomorrow morning I will be grinding the hell out of vex offensive tho.
It’ll be Sunday or next week for me
i literally have so much shit going on now that we basically have games every weekend and those literally take up my entire saturdays and half of fridays and i hate it so much lmao.
so I'm trying to get as much progress on those titles and cosmetic stuff as possible early on bc it only gets worse for me after like...a couple weekends from now.
"If any of yall have to dip out tonight I’ll be on late. If anyone stays up late and you all get a nice finish and wanna play vex incursions or strikes, lemme know."
Right now im gonna do some gambit and strikes. If anyone would like to join lemme know. Ill be on in a bit
I haven't had any oppurtunity to play at all this week so I'm sad
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) if you want you can swap in for me, I got the clear and trying to build a group Saturday so I don’t mind"
@Crizum ill be at a concert tonight til 11 or midnight est
"protip, just like solstice empty swords of the correct energy type count for the melee ability kills"
Ah okay I read that wrong
All you fam. Just giving the shoutout if it goes later or if ppl want the clear on other characters after that run i have a checkpoint
I blame it on the three hours of sleep
Yeah Ari apparently melee based supers also count
Oh hey they shipped Grimoire Volume II
okay...which gpu should i invest in: 2070 Super or 5700XT? I've heard the 5700 is pretty on par with the 2070 super and for considerably less money.
2070 super is clean for me but maybe benchmarks have 5700xt on par
I'll have to check out benchmarks again. i don't wanna spend more money especially since ray tracing is like...useless as far as basically everyone is concerned lmao.
but if i can pick up a 2070 super on a nice sale down the road then I'll go with that one. keeping an eye on the market in the meantime tho until I'm ready to buy.
Might as well go with the 2080 super over the 2070 super
it's like 50-100$ more
Relatively nice performance increase
"And if you want, you can get a hybrid watercooled from EVGA"
i don't want water anywhere near my pc lmao.
*Shrug*
air cooling hoe right here.
Both my CPU and my GPU are watercooled lol
But I'm running a mini-itx case so I don't have too much choice if I want it to stay cool
"i've never setup water cooling in all my pc builds, is it particularly difficult? any maintence for them long term?"
i also have a 1700X so idk if a 2080 would bottleneck that.
but i know for a fact a 2070 won't.
Custom loop watercooling is a PITA
I like AIO solutions
>> custom
😅
pre-made kits plz
Corsair / NZXT stuff has been around for quite awhile and works very well
i enjoy my absolute unit of a cooler.
Yeah I ain’t got room for all that lol. I really prefer small stuff
but i do also have a mid size build so really no need for me to spend extra money on AIO stuff.
Me and my fiancé’s comps
lil things
damn those are some compact cases haha.
yeap
but no compromise on specs
this is my set up at college.
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N882Z9R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 <-- the GPU i got my fiance
I'm running the 2080ti hybrid
yeh see i don't have money lmao.
which is why i say 2070 super. 2080 is really out of the question and I...dont really need it all things considered.
i like the looks of that case from the little there is haha.
Hmm. Yeah I guess. The 2070 super seems to be ranging between 500-600$
@Lonk looks like a nzxt case?
both my pc's have https://www.nzxt.com/products/h510i-matte-white
yayaya love the nzxt cases.
i also go to microcenter to buy my stuff and they usually have awesome deals.
Gosh I hate that store. But they got pretty much everything
lmao it's the best.
"no microcenter in FL, but I always am jealous when I see their deals on /r/buildapcsales"
Yeah they had a nice deal on my Ti.. think it was like 150 or 200$ off and then 70$ rebate
yeah i live in central FL but at college there's one in cleveland which is only like a 3 hour drive from me.
ayeee
i saved about $350 on my set up buying everything from there.
as opposed to ordering off Amazon.
"@Lonk but to answer your question from earlier, there really isnt any maintenance. You attach it like most other stuff and mount the radiator on the case"
I've got the NZXT Kraken M22 on my cpu
"and it just keeps using the same liquid, you don't have to clean it out?"
Its closed
and when you go water cooled you don't hookup any fans?
no fan on the cpu. the fans are on the radiator
aside from the radiator
"like case fans, ect"
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JF6NDC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1
You just attach that little pump onto the cpu
i think my nzxt case has 4 lol
that's it?!
i've seen build pics of people with tubes going all throughout their system
thats custom loop crap
"dangerous, expensive, and a pain in the ass"
have to clean out the tubes and replace the water every couple months
ah so that's where my confusion was coming from
"sheeeet, this kraken looks nice. I might switch"
Yeh it's awesome
the pump is all customizable and such as per the usual
got that RGB
makes the GPU faster you know
I use this currently https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/coolers/cpu-air-coolers/hyper-212-evo/
i have that one but in black.
https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Hybrid-Graphics-11G-P4-2384-KR/dp/B07MGZJP77 This is my GPU. Has a fan but also watercooled
honestly it's fantastic. my cpu stays hella cool.
"Lol, yeah i'm missing some frames cause of my lacking rgb"
"One radiator at the bottom of the case, the CPU radiator at the top"
I think my CPU maxes out around 55 degrees. GPU under full load is low 60's
"yeah, I've been real busy too @RonInDune . I tried for the day one on sat but that was all I've played this week"
same tho.
I idle at around 48
Haven't even cleared yet lol
my cpu idles around 25-28. under load have never gone above 55. gpu idles around 30 and same under load haven't gone above 63 is the highest I've seen.
dangggg
that's nice
same cooler and you're getting half
No idea what my idle is. Tbh I stopped paying attention after I got the cooling in the case figured out
but i have an i7-7700
2old
i just leave cputemp running in tray all the time 🤷
i mean still a solid CPU. i have a 1700X so certainly not the newest by any means either haha.
"cpu temp, cpu load, and ram usage %'s"
but i wanted those crispy 8 cores 😩
I've always been an intel/nvidia guy.. Have always been swayed away by the instability issues with AMD
I remember D2 peeps were pretty much unable to play for a good while cuz of issues with amd
bleh 😜
no issues here.
i do prefer nvidia gpus tho. but considering i also use my pc for work related programs and whatnot i ain't even look intels way.
8 core gang @thegoaliebear
i7-9700k meself
intel was just...way too overpriced for me considering the very marginal difference in performance I'd be getting for what i use my pc for.
~~my mistake was not getting the k model~~
Still about the stability/compatibility issue for me..
didn't intel announce recently the next wave will be significantly cheaper?
I'd rather pay the extra 50 bucks or whatever and know that likely anything I throw at it wont have problems :(
yeah bc AMD knocked them out @Lonk 😜
🤣
I've always ran amd and never had comparability issues
"Yeh, many dont have issues"
but its certainly not an undocumented issue
if you *only* game on your pc...then yeah intel is probs better. but otherwise AMD for life fam.
"Either way, it dun matter. its all personal preference"
make use of all those cores/threads. i love it.
aw shit its starbucks time
text me ur orders <3
caramel frap please 😜😩
damn that's what i like
but add salted to it ☑
yessss
"when they got that seasonal salt in stock, Mmmmm"
ill mail it to you
u have t in like
2 days
USPS
Nitro cold brew with pumpkin spice and almond milk plz
Lol ok brb
"i had the ""cloud"" several times. not sure if they still have it."
but it was great.
i had that
*once*
and i was stuck on the porceline throne all night
it was surprisingly good.
@Destiny [PC] alright this is a sanity check for myself: are other warlocks getting TITAN gear from Reckoning wagers?
"Oh yeah, that's a bug going on right now. Not just you"
Thanks Bungo
What tier reckoning are you doing?
I’ve tried every tier just for my own sanity but I farm 3 anyway
All tiers give Titan gear to warlocks
"Wow, okay"
It sucks pretty bad but I guess it’s an easy way to gear a Titan to your warlock’s light
Game is just telling you to cast fist instead of tickle fingers :punjiKappakan:
:up:
You never have to reload a fist
Ugh. That just reminds me of how warlock melee is slower/less range than both other classes
So frustrating
not even that bug could get me to play reckoning LOL.
so finding and feeding all the bunnies on the moon is a triumph needed for Harbinger LOL...in case anyone is going for that title.
argh
ive gotten 1 rice cake so far >:C
i think i have 3...wish i could send them to you haha.
*now accepting rice cakes*
"Rice and cakes don't go together at, y'all are heathens"
You’ve never heard of mochi?
:vomit:
the bunnies enjoy them.
that's all that matters.
mochi?
Japanese rice cakes
https://tenor.com/view/mochi-kinako-japanese-desserts-desserts-gif-10250527
Usually filled with various flavors. Ranging from red bean paste to melon
Pretty popular in hawaii too
Just a cute little reference to the lunar rabbit is all >_>
I just dislike mochi lol
"My wife is the same, doesn’t enjoy the texture"
Yeah. That texture is super popular there tho
blek
"Interesting, I've never heard of mochi before"
I'll see if there's any shop with it here in Houston
Oi
I'm also in houston
you can find it all over
cool cool
Here you go Ron https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tmSrULDVRPc
"If you don't yell, its not real mochi"
lol that is hilarious
I genuinely thought that was a parody at first
https://tenor.com/view/pestle-and-mortar-mochi-making-gif-3519968
:kk:
So when do you guys reckon Bungie will try actual crossplay? Maybe not on the PvP side but PvE only
They've talked about it
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/bungie-talks-about-problems-with-crossplay-1
Once everyone agree's with it I guess
I think in terms of PvE it could be beneficial for everyone
Higher populations is good
I don’t even want them to try until they can get steam working with their lfg app
hahaha yeah.
"PvP.. i mean I guess crossplay is fine, assuming they go the COD route and restrict it between platforms unless you opt in lol"
I wonder if the MCC will have it
after modern warfare come out sometime
"I think I'm in the minority who only plays CoD for the story, so I don't know how well they did"
Is there anything on steam with cross play? How do they handle names
"MCC probably will, you can use m&k already on Xbox one I think?"
"I think some of the fighting games have crossplay on steam, like street fighter"
I remember someone saying Ark and Minecraft also has crossplay
minecraft has it for all but pc
can you mod minecraft on console?
not to my knowledge
"I'm fairly excited for the MCC as well, the gunplay in the recent Halo reach demo looks so good"
Also feels very much like Destiny
They were probably working on destiny while finishing up reach
Though I'm worried the PvP skill cap will be immense
i think you can mod minecraft on console but its super limited to whats in the store
I wonder if the original Halo people are still in Bungie
Jason Jones is
Twab is out
||Are there really no new IB weapons?||
it's 500 kills each.
bring out that monarque
is that the lightning? does the chain count
"You're thinking of the trinity ghoul, monarque is the poison"
But for trinity ghoul the chain kills should count yes
"I’d guess the lightning would count, risk runner chains count"
i'm using the exotic primary bow atm
so i can use LQ in energy
wish-ender?
im trying to figure out what lq is
L||oaded|| Q||uestion||
ohhhhhhhhhhh
"it's not as bad as I thought, 20% bow kills in 1 match"
"for those in the raid tonight, if you've watched Datto's video...I think I like the second strategy they do more tbh. lmk yalls thoughts on it tho."
"It seems to be the quicker option imo, and ad clear shouldn't be a problem, so I'm down for the second strategy as well"
yeah. we're all properly leveled for it. but having 4 people outside should also help ad clearing go much faster. same with having 2 people in at the same time.
I haven’t played in like 3 days
I’m having withdrawls
that is rough.
@thegoaliebear I agree. I like the idea of having dedicated mote team
instead of having 6 different people rotating motes..
"Four to take care of boss arena, 2 to handle motes"
Agreed. The first strategy opens up the door for more confusion
Yeah it's just waaaaay too much rotation
mhm...just organizes things more. i think we will definitely have this thing tonight haha.
I wanna be team mote bois
So you want the easy job lol
Lol i just like collcting motes :b Idc wat i do
I’ll have to watch the video to see what two strategies you are all talking about. We did 2 teams finish blue then switch to red
Spawns less cyclops
it's very straightforward in the video. nothing too fancy about it but i think it's just a lot easier on people not having to worry about rotating or switching around or whatever. and you only need one team to do it.
"I mean, sounds pretty much the same. 2 people go through portal on blue side twice to get 30 motes, then move over to red side and repeat. At least that's what I get from it"
"basically 3 groups of 2 I guess. 2 on blue managing cyclops and ads, 2 on red doing the same. 2 on mote team that cover both sides"
"@Crizum same here, that's what my team used day 1"
"yeah. we can have one person from each ""team"" that go into the portal together. that way we can keep an even 2-2 outside."
my group rotated 2 teams of 2 collectors to first finish blue and then finish red
Because when you destroy the weak spot to bring the first team back the second team can go in and you aren’t spawning a bunch of extra cyclops
so efficient and much faster becuase you got 2 people clearing adds for motes
exactly yeah
Is there a reason to have 2 teams rotate collector?
Instead of just having the same 2 people do it for both sides
The buff you get when banking to remove shields on vex
day 1 was different from what it is now
I know that @Crizum
I havent played it without the contest modifier yet
so maybe the strat that I used is outdated
Yeah Datto’s second strat is the k e we used
yeh that's the strat we were saying seemed better anyway lol.
"Two in they bank, different two in they bank, first team goes to opposite portal"
I guess I’m getting confused cause @Kit is saying the same two people and not two teams
I can't tell if we're saying the same thing lol
"If ya have 2 teams of 2 going through both portals at the same time, ur leaving only 1 on each side to manage cyclops, weak spots, and gobs"
Which im assuming is NOT what you're saying
"ah, yeah I'm saying both teams go in blue"
"(1 + 2) go to blue portal and collect 15 - 18 motes.
(1 + 2) return, (3 + 4) go to blue portal and collect 15 - 18 motes.
(1+2) go to red portal and collect 15 - 18 motes.
(1  + 2) return, (3 + 4) go to red portal and collct 15 - 18 motes.

(5 + 6) remain at boss at all times"
when the first team gets out the second team goes in
"you only open each portal twice, so you only have to deal with 4 cyclops in total"
"the mote collecting teams have 2 people, so they are safer, can move more quickly, and bring back more motes so only 2 trips required (per relay)"
The only thing to be careful of is spacing out the times at which people deposit their motes
My team pretty much had this encounter down - no problems with motes/add clearing at all
Its just we didn't have the raw DPS to bring down the boss
i think what kit was getting confused with was *when* mote team goes into the portal.
"got through like 3 damage phases, he had like maybe 20 or 25% health left"
ah.
Yeah we're saying the same thing.
About to enter vex offensive for the first time lol
"Never mind, haven't unlocked it lol"
So how good is Sleeper in the meta right now ? It's the only exotic heavy that I've not been seeing at all these days
Not great.
Damage per shot is quite low.
Such a sad fall for a great gun. It's one of my fave exotics
WE DONE IT BOIS
Great job
Anyone set up a raid for later? I've never been through a raid :blob:
depending on the time id be happy to help
"Nice, you good for 12 hours from now?"
"@Arixama nice! I ended up passing out almost immediately, happy for y’all"
"@Rox unfortunately i won't be on until late tonight and will only be playing for an hour or so. however, if you know a specific day and time you would be available for a raid, you can use the `!lfg create` command to make a post for one!"
"Hey, I'm looking for some opinions.
Let's say you had a very important raid coming up tomorrow, ...maybe around reset time, and you wanted to have a good gun for it.

Which of these do you think you could finish faster?

21% Delirium: <https://i.imgur.com/LIRWjg2.png>
or
Wendigo GL3: <https://i.imgur.com/Jd7hyh8.png>"
Wendigo
Do you have swarm + spike?
Then I might actually recommend delirium instead
finish 21%. it's more useful throughout the other encounters tbh.
yeah I'd go 21% myself
I gotta get it too
it will make quick use for add clearing especially in the second and third encounters. @Lonk
Why not both? Super close for delirium and should be able to finish it in a couple matches of prime.
"Hm, okay. I'll try for the envoys then before tomorrow"
yeah if time remains i'll begin finishing the other
but i don't have so much time before then so that's why I wanted opinions on one 👌
yeah...wendigo is good BUT you have a swarm with spike so that's just fine if you did want to use a GL at any point. the encounters are fairly close range so i wouldn't recommend something with the potential to kill yourself haha.
MT 👀
Not a fan of mt in Garden
for the first encounter a GL is good. but also it'll depend what role you're doing in the encounters.
Well wendigo+mt is probably not the loadout for garden
But the first two encounters mt+21% can do some work
Just try to have an smg/auto/hand cannon with anti-barrier or overload rounds
i have anti barrier on breakneck and overload on recluse. worked real well. but definitely comes down to preference for which weapons you choose to use.
there's barrier in gos?
yeah not too many tho. just in the second encounter.
"Yeah, but in addition to barrier mobs the anti-barrier rounds can go through the shields on vex minds and when hobgoblins heal"
A recluse with anti-barrier is op
mhm. super nice. especially for dealing with angelics.
@Arixama what method on void titan again did you say was good for the grenade/melee kill farm?
@thegoaliebear middle tree sentinal with void wall grenades
I used an empty sword for most of the melee kills though
sweet. was there a certain lost sector that was really fast? i was just going to the one in archer's line.
"I know the raid counts as on the moon, I think vex incursion may also? Maybe just to save grinding the kills out until you’re done in the incursion?"
ugh realized i never played the first SK mission on my titan haha. oh well...gotta start somewhere.
"Vex incursions after public events is what I used for the grenades since you get a fuck ton of vex, and not a lot of people are doing them super consistently."
Btw don’t forget armormentarium
Or however it’s spelled
Raid and vex offensive both count as moon locations
"Also don't forget, if you've got Monte carlo thats a lotta melee abilities"
Yeah I think most of my melee was done in phase 2 of the raid with monte
"Or since you’re on pc you can load a public event flag, use melee and grenade, and reload the zone for the flag again"
whew...92% on grenade kills. those triumphs are such a grind lol.
If sentinel Titan do bottom tree
I think that refunds grenade energy on grenade kills
Middle tree is better with void wall because it applies detonator on every pulse that grant ability energy back. I used heart of inmost light for the empowerment on using abilities to get everything up super fast
Yeah I guess that’s better if surrounded and detonator counts as grenade kills
I just hate void wall
Just because it isn’t the solar grenade
grenades are done haha...now just the melee kills.
I think supers count. At least way of the wraith does
Possibly shield hits too
yeah i switched to bottom tree. shield bash kills count as well and you can get like three or four at a time if ads are grouped up.
I think people said you can use a sword for the melee?
make it run out of ammo and match the energy you need
yeah that's what i'm doing.
just farming a lost sector. went from 52% to 82% in like 15 mins aha.
@Destiny [PC] i'll be on around 1030 EST tonight just for an hour or so doing some crucible to make some progress on randy's throwing knife. if anyone wants to join then lmk.
so i have been using Edgewise in Vex Offensive and honestly it's real good. i enjoy it.
demolitionist is nice but i've preferred using rampage. thing absolutely shreds through ads.
Don't let them get a word in edgewise
If that isnt the flavor text ill be v disappointed
"the rainbow pins are back for sale, if anyone missed out the first time: https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1182717500317818881"
God Damnit bungie I just gave you a bunch of my money 😭
Atleast the shipping isn't as astronomical as usual
What was the shipping on your grimoire?
So $12
And it's $4.76 for the pride pin
Anyone else pre-order those shoes?
"I got the pin and the grimoire and shipping was just over 12, so it's flat rate shipping boxes"
:yay:
"I don't like ordering shoes online, they never fit quite right and I'm not perfectly used to the American sizes"
Ari that makes sense but still $12 ...
"Yeah, really depends on the brand.. but even then they vary between styles"
"They didnt do half sizes, so i just went with 9 since I'm usually 8.5-9"
I didnt know they were dropping a black pair till it went live. Had to scoop them up
"Shipping on my grimoire book was also $ 11.90, but it was 2day priority, not parcel"
"I want the shoes, but if the decision on how much money I get to spend on gaming clothes is shoes vs raid jacket I gotta go with the jacket :/"
I hear ya. Not sure I'm gonna pick up the jacket.. It's kinda really ugly imo :what:
Bungie should collaborate with yeezy
Yeah no please keep Kanye away
The giant black doom dorito under the moon is actually Kanye's post apocalyptic recording studio backup
I'm not buying the raid jacket haha. it's so expensive and I'd never wear it.
Pins/Seals/Books are about as far as I'm going
It’s less to wear and more to have. Goblin brain and all that
i will probably get the t shirt for the raid tho.
"That's right, anybody want my jacket code?"
I don't really buy the raid jackets
"I should have given my crown jacket too, but I forgot about it"
I remember people on reddit saying Crown raid jackets were selling for >$150 on ebay
"I've been of the mindset that if I want that jacket, I get that completion myself"
Very agreed
Wait I got the Anomalous Signal emblem and not the True Colours one
From the pin
The pin itself should come with the code? Since it was a live event thing
that's probably the general emblem you get if you buy something during the season going on at the time.
not 100% sure tho.
Yeah I see that makes sense
Probably got the Anomalous Signal from the purchase during season 8 and you'll get the other emblem from the pin itself
@RonInDune it should have added True Colors and Anomalous to your cart
You'd get an email with a link that would open 2 different PDF's with the code
"It only added Anomalous, and I got the one email. It's similar to Emblem of Synth from last season"
Lemme check the store page again
Oh this seems to clear that up:
Mine wasnt lol
I got it immediatly
welp gotta contact customer service then
When did you order it? Maybe they changed the procedure?
12:05pm
CST
for anyone grinding edgewise its heavyweight today
^^ get it yall it's a good lmg.
still skeptical of it being better than 21%
but good no doubt
i've liked it a bit more. i guess since i'm on hunter i have my dodge reload so overflow isn't a sorely missed perk on my end aha.
"Heavyweight on the strikes playlist, right?"
I think Killing Tally lasting forever and doing quite a bit more damage kinda pushes 21% over the edge
thats my thought
just the uptime on the damage
and im not sure if it was nerfed like rampage
It wasn't!
so more damage and more uptime
"But edgewise has demolitionist/field prep etc., which are very useful perks"
it's definitely worth getting. always nice to have another mg option.
yeah def agreed
AvAlAnChE iS tHe BeSt LmG

How was the boss encounter guys?
ez clap
jk it took us a few runs lol
"we called our final attempt, and actually got it on our last run"
Nice! Happy for yall
Any further attempts this weekend?
"Just the one you’re in Ron, still need a person if anyone is interested"
I have a checkpoint at the boss - I’m out of town but monday night I’d like to use it if we have enough interest
I could create a lfg
Raid ready 👍
I'm up to 931 so I think I'm ready to give it a go.
yeah you'll be fine. i was 933 when i did the boss and had no issues.
I'm at 912 with zero experience in the raid so far. Be honest: would I be able to put in enough work in time to finish the raid before reset?
"You might be able to pull it off, but it would be tough and probably require a lot of competitive crucible."
"Thawx it's doable, but you're going to need to grind fast, do literally all the bounties everywhere, plus the vex invasions on the moon"
Remember some vendors drop +0 stuff to max out your gear
Is there a particular recommended order? ex: crucible-> vex-> bounties-> vendors
I'd say that's a good order. Just make sure it's comp Crucible for those sweet powerful drops every sub-rank
Crucible give powerfuls even if you drop back and gain
Is there a limit/goal to reach for vex/crucible
namely vex
"Also, does Black Armory fit in anywhere?"
Unfortunately Black Armory does not drop powerfuls
they did away with a lot of the powerful drops
Btw @Arixama the deluxe edition ||Cryptoglyph links now forwarding to full texts: https://redd.it/dgm3lx||
some of the dreaming city stuff will drop powerful gear like the well and possibly from the weekly mission.
i went up 10 levels since tuesday
anyone willing to go through a nightfall?
There's matchmaking now
oh. alrighty then. thanks for the heads up
Do Nightfall:The Ordeal for matchmaking
The first two levels
Anyone want to come help me  kill the 980 Nightmare on moon
Oh man poor Crota apparently got Final Destination-ed to his death: ||https://www.bungie.net/en/explore/detail/news/48287||
goddam Eris is badass
(that's from ||https://www.bungie.net/en/explore/detail/news/48289||)
"@RonInDune i really like how they lean into the religious side of Hive when it comes to them and their throne world. the capitalization of ""He"" and ""Him"" really goes along with how Hive see their ""gods"" but also implies that maybe we as Guardians throughout history saw them as gods too."
That is indeed pretty cool. Plus they call us liars/heretics
Calus called them on their bullshit
"Yeah but Savathûn has already infiltrated Calus' memoires, so i don't know how much out golden space daddy can actually push back"
"Oh I don’t trust him at all, just thought it was a funny line haha"
❓ ❓ ❓
@Destiny [PC] ^ sunday night I'll be playing pvp...if you want to hate crucible with me then come on in lmao.
"went up 5 light to 917 tonight; is this looking promising for the raid if this continues? (btw, what is your recommended light for raid?)"
"That's pretty good progress, I would try to get up to 925-930 because the final encounter's recommended light is 940. Make sure that you do as many bounties as you can to level up your artifact as well. I would definitely get a second opinion though."
Alright I left the PS4 clan and send request for PC Clan x_X
we've had so many new people join on PC. that is awesome! :clan_discord:
!lfg help
We still need one 😱
"Hey for all my hunters, I finally got a pair of shards of galanor, are they still any good after the nerf?"
"Good in pvp and gambit, but there's better stuff to use elsewhere"
^ in pve there's really no use. not when orpheus and raiden flux are still so much better.
"tomorrow if i can, i might hop on before pvp if anyone wants to try and defeat the vex overlords on the moon for the triumph. 3 people at our PLs will be plenty."
"I found out the hard way that I don't have enough solo damage for an overlord, barely even got a third of its health"
So I'm down
yeah i had a 910 guy in my instance one day and we got the overlord down to like...15% health. so if we get a third that will help us get the extra damage numbers.
"I'm glad they're tuned enough that you can't solo them, but not so hard you can't do it with a full fireteam"
for sure. having all 3 people is nice since that extra person really makes a difference in damage.
"Do mods like Major Resist, Boss Resist, ect stack?"
It should say on the mod if it does or does not stack with multiple copies
Oh weird those ones don't
yeah the dreambane mods do but not the resist ones
I believe they do.
@Destiny [PC] any chance there’s a person available that would like to try for Divinity?
I’ll be down this evening @Crizum but I’m guessing you mean now
"Give me a few mins and I'll be down, just finishing up breakfast"
"Depends on how long we keep trying haha, but if we’re still at it and someone drops I’ll let you know"
Awesome! @Gimmie2
Ran divinity last night beat the raid realized i didnt have the quest on my titan
so i had to do it again this morning rip
big ol oof right there
raided with a bunch of italian guys this morning they spoke italian more in the raid than english lmao
made the puzzles a little difficult
"Late, but good luck y'all!"
@Oathbreaker thoughts?
It might hit range cap? Not horrible but equally not great. Better rolls exist from what I can remember
How's the raid going???
"Consistently damage phase, but issues with him actually taking damage"
👁  = ☠
what strat are you guys running?
"2,2,2?"
"if that means 2 gambit, 2 gambit, 2 home. Then yes"
and 1 side at a time?
are you using your gambit guys to tether?
It just may be people being under 930
you can 3 phase under 930 its tough though
izanagis is unreal for dmg
poor man's izanagis
oh nooooo rip
"if you dont have izanagi's, try substituting sole survivor"
or whisper
firing line + 4th time/triple tap/field
his chest has a huge crit multiplier so whisper is decent
"Whisper and darci might work too, but generally you want to run a GL with auto-loading for just a bit of extra dmg"
yea i wouldnt recommend darci since he moves a fair bit but whisper and then a sole survivor is good
like izanagi's is rly good damage but the boss is a real big damage sponge
i used izanagi and wendigo with recluse
seems like the best loadoout
fast clear for gambit and good boss dmg
i used DARCI and it worked just fine. you're really not going to be pressed for damage unless you're super under leveled for it.
"imagine having to pick up orbs of light for your heavy to do damage

_ ~ this post made by swarm of the raven gang_"
Any progress???
Still can't reach a 2nd damage phase
I'm gonna do it tonight no matter what
"remember to play safe, stay behind cover

**and take out those cyclops as soon as they come up**"
make sure u call it out every damn time
and someone's got a honed edge shot ready for it immediately
^^ cyclops are so important.
2 MT shots take them down too
how's the raid going guys
we've gottem him below half now
To about 1/3rd or less actually
"got the boss down to one third, we are so close to getting the last damage phase we need"
nice you got this...it'll all fall into place you just need that one run!
LF2m on fresh GoS raid
If anyones down 🙂
if you guys need help with anything in the raid i can hop in
working on randys throwing knife and i kinda do not like crucible
mood.
i wanna get the seal for undying
need all the ritual weapons
"Same. Fortunately, the other two ritual weapons are not near as grindy as Randy's"
1st try!
(By 1st I mean like 11 hours after we started)
Yeah it was very easy and not at all soul crushing
https://gyazo.com/06119dca50ca5a7e452a0a5f65a8200f Definitely first try
its a fun weapon
Just got an email from bungie for the garden jacket and shirt. Anybody want it?
"Yeah same here, if you want the jacket/shirt code hit me up"
Quick bump for monday night raid boss encounter.
i likely won't be on tomorrow have so much work and studying to get done. but if you end up getting people for sure and absolutely need one I'll join.
nice. can't wait to hate pvp with yall :)))
I put as alternate because i might be home sooner than expected and would be down for some pvp after a long weekend
sweet. i'll probs be playing for a couple hours so if you're back feel free to jump in whenever.
Man I keep running in to people not using scouts
Like why would you play pvp if not grinding a weapon lol
it's annoying yeah hahaha.
like fam. i just want to get this done. help me out. 😂
Play rumble and pray the others in the lobby have no thumbs haha
Oh god the sweats are out
Mountaintop and scout
hey guys is anyone available to invite my friend to the clan?
https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=2840602
They should be able to request invite thru this page
Goddamn Shaxx has absolutely zero chill
"“You’re second, good. Just like Zavala is second to me.”"
Who works on the crucible team I wanna punt their children
I spent so long getting used to hand cannons and pulses that now using scouts against people who are actually trying to win I get frustrated lol
yeah it is hard for sure. but tonight with all of us running scouts we can go back to y1 meta team shooting :)))
"I had a comp game against someone who was 751, using only blues and mismatched Armour and still beat my ass like a bell"
It was beautiful to watch lol
Check profile and dude started playing yesterday
This persons using mindbenders and spare rations
Wonder what it’s like to have to pay for sex
i'm hopping on now does anyone want to kill overlords on the moon? @Destiny [PC]
I'm not really feeling up to crucible tonight so i'm gonna leave the lfg.
spider and i are doing overlord hunts on the moon rn if you want to join feel free.
@Destiny [PC] one more person pls we will have these overlords easy we got him to like...deadass 1% health.
give me one second
unless you want it @Peronix ?
i dont mind lol
there's a public event spawning in 1 min archer's line. but we will definitely have it with a full fireteam haha.
**D E A D A S S ?**
***DEADASS***
it's all good @Trissin! I'm trying to get some fusion rifle kills in Crucible anyways
Does anyone still have their raid jacket code that isnt going to use it?
I got a clan buddy on PS4 that wont be able to get it done in time probably but wants to get the jacket
ive got mine
dc?
going to tower aha.
god this randys throwing knife quest is brutal
450 scout kills and the 14000 points for kills and medals
The quickest way to complete the 14k objective is to get Cold Fusion medals--1% a piece
That’s garbage haha
"Yeah, pretty frustrating"
once i'm done with scout kills i guess i will try anything to get those medals faster haha. it's ridiculous.
but i want to get this out of the way before i do the other stuff.
Yeah I wanna work my way up to the fun stuff
Spam Jötunn or loaded question for a lot of fun
i am just doing another vex offensive before this.
we doin team shootin?
sick im in
control ughhh. it's okay we'll team shoot even more haha.
Oh cool they still load you in to lost matches
alright I can join in whenever the match ends!
same here!
just ended
"alright I'm back I think, I can join in when free"
we're headed to the tower
feel free to join up
"btw this is my pov from what happened after my blade barrage LOL
https://www.twitch.tv/thegoaliebear/clip/FaintDepressedPonyCharlietheUnicorn?filter=clips&range=7d&sort=time"
@thegoaliebear fantastic
I've never had more faith in my team than now
im the traveler now
"sup nerds, anyone wanna be @rozak and I's 3rd for master ordeal"
might be tough because we are both around 940
hunter warlock
@Destiny [PC]
Just got home - figure pvp memes have ended for the night?
@Chance would love to do the 3rd tier (not at comp yet) at 950 but im only 935 or so and dont have divinity yet so unsure about trying 980
Basically still need to do 100k mightfall but 980 might be iffy. I do have izanagis tho
oh hey I just got monte carlo from a  comp game
think Bungie is taking pity on me
damn we just found a 3rd tho
I finally got a one two punch shotgun from the moon
still need one myself
I think the moon has a fixed one-two punch roll on the first drop?
"Also, fairly late but bread finally acquired"
*it is done*
I’m a sad boi
"If I can’t use this checkpoint tonight, I would love to raid tomorrow or wednesday night ❤️"
"@Peronix Love the flavor text on that gun. How do you like it, worth the grind?"
"It feels great to use! If you don't mind Crucible, I'd say it's worth it"
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) I’ll be around, if you can’t find another 6th let me know"
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) I can definitely raid tomorrow night. and i do prefer that since i don't really have time for leveling other characters so the powerful drops will help.
"I can as well, pretty much every day aside from Thursday evening since I’m currently between jobs heh"
i just have a huge exam tomorrow so won't be on at all tonight.
"Come on...
<https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dhoya8/2_man_sanctified_mind_sol_inherent_3_phase_kill/>"
imagine not having a life.
so glad i can't.
pun intended.
@Oathbreaker @Trissin when you guys gunna do this one?
I haven't even *tried* the raid
So tomorrow
😂 😂
dethrone those Redeem scrubs.
"I'm waiting for ""solo calus, Randy's only"""
when i get my medals done 7 years from now we can try it.
!rank gos
solo Calus is only technically possible IF you control 2 pcs with a single person
only PC clan members have done Garden so far. we LOVE that.
otherwise not possible to solo
"14 people have completions in our clan, that's pretty good for week 1"
i don't think any raids in D2 can be 100% solo'd and honestly i like that.
"Nah, they're too mechanics heavy to do that"
yeah i like it tbh.
I love blueberries
“Get ready I’m bringing this grenade stuck to my face to you”
Why bro
"I'm torn on it, because yeah, Crota's End was a strike, but it would be super fucking cool to see someone solo a raid with extremely difficult mechanics for a solo player"
"(I’m less salty today since scout rifle kills are done, but I still feel bad going 100% jotunn)"
Closest we’ll see is one person doing all the damage and a second just for mechanics?
within the current environment would be someone multi-boxing (controlling 2 pcs) an entire raid
the only raid that can be done on would be something like Crown I think
I think eater would be the most likely
I don't think Eater is possible due to leapfrog
"You need 5/6 people for that encounter, do you not?"
"Would love to do this fam. Anyone is welcome. Experience helps go by quicker so if you are new, please look up encounter guides. We got this in one night"
@here GoS full clear tomorrow night 8 pm est. RIP my checkpoint but this group is excellent so excited to do it again
i won't be home until like 815 most likely if that's fine.
well that's the latest all depends how long my midterm takes i could be home earlier.
gl ady! And that's fine. 15 min not gonna make or break anybody. I just wanted to give decent time to get thru it in one sitting (I think is doable with the group we could have)
Does arbalest count as fusion rifles for the purposes of cold fusion medals?
thanks it's a huge midterm so I'm going hard tonight for it haha.
@Crizum i'm not sure but maybe try it and see? if it does count then that's a nice alternative lol.
It doesn’t count. Back to sandbagging with the toaster
rip.
i just have to crank out these scout kills. then i can play like a total asshole haha.
Truly as Bungie intended
“Medicare for Thrall” is on my team
hahaha love that.
was there something people have been using in energy slot that they prefer over black scorpion?
"I have a strong legendary primary scout, but i need a good legendary option as I want to keep my exotic for last word or thorn in the build. Also preferably solar, but that's not super necessary. I know someone mentioned using something other than scorpion"
black scorpion is probs the best option in that slot for scouts. I've actually been using black tiger which is the blue version of it lol.
that's what it was
ok. i have a curated no feelings. I'll try both out
i might get a better rolled black scorpion
the unfortunate thing is that people actually try in crucible ?? so constantly running into shotgun apes with last word/ace/thorn is annoying.
ya that's why I want to have that additionally as well. play on their level
also quickplay ----- waaaaay worse than comp fwiw
i have to say last night was hella fun just fucking around as a stack.
literally not giving a shit about the control objectives😂 i went from 52% to 72% on my scout kills and
wait for it
huge progress on medals
21% to 23%!
*the real end game is the friendgame*
how do they fuck up the tuning so badly for this.
I missed the messages from earlier but big congrats @RonInDune !!!!
Once you have your scout rifle kills @thegoaliebear put on a set of fusion rifle boosting armor and use jotunn. Getting 3-5% per match. Who cares if it’s throwing
Does anyone want an anomalous signal emblem? I've got an extra one
sick. idc about stats after that lmao i just wanna get this shit done😂
Telesto would probably also work
Thanks trissin!
Hey what clan is Mtashed in?
Resolute I think
Oh so it is him
"Still laughing at Dr. **** you, PhD."
incredible.
So apparently Bungie's been hinting at a major unsolved mystery: ||https://redd.it/dhksbh||
"get on it, detectives"
I'm on raidsecrets atm as well and just read an amazing tidbit
Goblins stop sacrificing themselves to the construct if it's full on the final boss of GoS
there's so much material for this midterm it's ungodly -_- all i wanna do is play destiny lmao.
You can do it! It's all for a good cause!
so i'm about halfway through this study guide and there's still 8 more powerpoints to go.
and each one has *at least* 60 slides.
dayum
8 page study guide and still 6 powerpoints to go.
and...
single spaced no less.
The puzzle has been solved: ||https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1183853014236291078||
Yeah I was talking earlier about how badass one of the texts made Eris sound!
anyone feel like leveling up the season pass?
I'm like level 35-ish and mostly by doing lots and lots of bounties
"Do every single bounty you can find anywhere, and then do the infinite ones"
"i think I'm like 32 or something. haven't actually dedicated myself to bounties that's just passive bounties from gunsmith, pvp, and eris most recently over the last week or so for me."
more concerned with these ritual weapons hahaha. so i don't always remember to grab bounties specifically.
I'm 51
nice.
"i really just said ""i'm gonna take a 25 min study break"" and i said that at like 7:15 what happened LOL"
"i mean, to me it only looks like 7 minutes😬"
i've literally been distracted for nearly two hours now.
goal go study
don't be me
and play destiny instead of studying
that's my thing
"update: 10 page, single-spaced study guide complete. and now i still have the textbook chapters to review."
i am not in grad school yet i can't do this shit currently lmaooo.
YOu can do this!!
Grad school is way easier trust me
oh i'm honestly looking forward to it.
won't have all this hockey shit taking up an unnecessary amount of my time 😂
@thegoaliebear finished vex offensive triumphs :BAblobby:
@Destiny [PC] Need 4 for heroic menag run
"I'll jump in, just gotta finish this nightfall"
76561197981728457
SSN?
"Steam ID, lol"
says ur not currently only
online*
"Sam got it, 🤷"
if you click on his name in the clan list you can send a friend invite
I'd love to
the entire system is busted and someone should feel bad.
~~Need 1 more~~
@Thawxtem you okay over there? infinite load?
potato
Didn’t do the raid at all oops
Been so busy
Didn’t realize the end date was so soon
"oh well, I’m only at like 910 power"
"Don't worry, there's no end date for the raid"
just for the week 1 rewards
"Random question: For EP, is 3 still the max fireteam size to load into an instance?"
"Basically, do we still have to do the ""everybody split up and fast travel to glacial drift until we find each other"""
"For ep it is still 3, but with good loadout 3 should be enough"
"ah, I see."
"Yeah, it should be but I've got a few kinderguardian friends who are new to the game"
Was thinking of running it through with them
THat reminds me I have a bunch of encrypted and decrypted cache keys lying around
Gotta use them at some point
I'll be looking to get a set of EP armor 2.0
Yeah EP armour looks so good!
Warmind in general had the best aesthetic
the real endgame isn't raids or dungeons or seals
it's fashion
Fashion souls is best souls
kinderguardian 😝 👶
young blueberries
"If ya'll wanna EP sometime this week, lemme know. Maybe wednesday-friday sometime? I still need shotty, and this reset should be shotty week. Have some keys and other things saved up and wanna complete that to inevitably get wayfarer some years in the future lol"
@Trissin id be down to do a fast travel search
"finished up the scout rifle kills for randys, anyone have tips for the medals part"
"Try to get Cold Fusion medals (2 fusion rifle kills without reloading). Counts 1% percent each. Any multi-kill weapon medals, really, but I think Cold Fusion is the fastest"
Erentil and Jotunn work well for getting Cold Fusion
Love dismantling my eververse bounty notes one at a time for 5 dust a peice.
still have to get through the day and this midterm but looking forward to raiding tonight lol. if i end up getting back early I'll probs just run a few vex offensive to finish up these last couple triumphs or as much as i can of them.
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) you have to quit destiny now, sorry"
@thegoaliebear gl!
Got in a nightfall right before server maintenance and walked out with enhanced grenade launcher loader
Iron Banner time? :derp_blob:
Still doing iron banner @CrizMobius?
from the cryptograph lore posted by bungie 😬
@RonInDune ^ ik you like the lore.
It is pretty exciting! That's similar to how Xivu Arath and Savathûn came back to life the first time after Oryx killed them
it would be insane if that's actually where this season and/or year of D2 leads to.
"I still want to see if Savathûn's plan to take over the Distributary works, but yeah this is pretty great as well. Especially since Oryx will now be far weaker since he's no longer the Taken King"
alright fam...midterm time is here. see yall on the other side💀😂😂
"Good luck, you got this!!!"
good luck
it wont be near as bad as trying to get medals for randy's!
Man Bungie has really outdone themselves with this:
Peak Bungo
Honestly I've been responsible for some pretty terrible bugs so I can empathize
that's like a metaphor for the kind of questions on my exam😂
You've made it!
i survived haha.
good!!
and finished early. so more time for destiny tonight😂
i have another midterm tomorrow but it's in my easy class so i can just study before it lol.
iron banner quest is SUPER easy
I'll be on around 715 est so if anyone wants to try for the overlords on the moon lmk. i need the ones in the Hellmouth and anchor of light. rng permitting lol. @Destiny [PC]
so you have to do the iron banner quest on all character
nice can't wait to not do it.
"I know I haven’t really done anything in destiny lately, but I’d appreciate it if I could keep my spot in the clan unless you need more room. I do plan on coming back, I just haven’t had a ton of free time lately, and what time I’ve had I just haven’t been motivated to dive into the new mechanics. Thanks for keeping me around guys"
no worries you're fine.
won't really be doing a bunch of active recruiting anyway i feel we have a good number and core group now.
Did y'all see that pay2win login crap?
Just remember to praise Lord Shaxx every night and you're good
in destiny?
Huh I had a free one that I used on my titan to skip all the pre Forsaken content
Yeah they’ve done these before
"Honestly blown away, because it’s all bungie at this point"
"Yeah but before I had activision to blame, now there’s only one possible culprit"
"I mean...getting characters, especially alts, to 900 is super easy. so they'd really just be wasting their money lmao."
"Does Iron Banner count towards randys throwing knife quest?
idk if they consider that playlist 'Crucible'"
🙏
it should. the real question is does it grant bonus progress.
goin in for a marathon with jade rabbit then
lmk if it seems like it goes up faster lol.
doesnt seem to be
wow.
love that so much.
on now if anyone would like to try for the moon overlords @Destiny [PC]
man i suck so bad with scout rifle on pc
four matches and i've gone up 2% for randy's
i still use controller when i play pvp
~~Does it give aim assist on pc?~~
A little yeah
Targeting adjuster and enhanced scout rifle targeting helps a lot
"Wow holy crap, plugged in controller and immedietly got 4 kill multi kill"
yeah ima go this route for pvp lol
@RonInDune you ready?
Ah I'm so sorry
Can you find a +1?
I didn't realize it was this early
@ruGGed_koala @the_drake1997 either one of you available for garden rn?
Not at the moment... Sorry. Maybe in an hour or so?
yeah we'll still be on unless rugged is available sooner.
"I'm running back right now, I'll try to make it"
sweet no worries. we're just doing pvp so @ us whenever.
I already have Divinity so if you get a +1 start up without me
it's fine we have a couple people who haven't gotten the quest started yet so we're not doing it aha.
How do you start that sum Bitch???
you go to where the raid starts and kill a bunch of stuff and the gatelord will drop and exotic engram which is the quest.
and this is done in free mode don't actually load into the raid haha.
Just downloading the update
Will join up in a sec
good luck again yall
How far did y'all make it last week? Or was it as far as we went and that's all?
And you can get there in free mode? Like in patrol?
yeah it's in patrol.
just did a comp game
got a we ran out of medals
ayeee nice.
any raid groups going a little later in the week?
not as of now. but if you'd like to set one up then definitely do that.
awe i have a game friday night :(((
can always move it to saturday
i have a game saturday too LOL
"Perfect, I was just thinking of doing that friday"
@Rye ?
hm?
wassup
is that friday?
I can't do at that time
I'll still be at work
this iron banner quest isnt bad at all
a lot shorter than the first
will have to drop from the raid tonight sorry guys. have way too much work to get done today.
so @Destiny [PC] spot open for Garden tonight ^
I finally got my Grimoire Volume II!!
I'll join up for the raid!
@Rye have you done it yet? if not just make sure you watch a video!
@RonInDune sneak peaks?
@thegoaliebear I have not
okay. I would definitely watch a video then just to familiarize with the roles and mechanics.
ayee i made it on the list this time
we literally love that.
Divinity is busted in Gambit I love it
imagine if I never switched to PC...
i wouldn't have that week one clear lmao.
I’ll be sure to study up
Oof the art is amazing. Look at Mara being amazing !
😫
I won't post anymore to avoid spoilers! But it is certifiably amazing
"14,000?! What the hell man 😱"
That quest keeps on giving aha
i love when people figure out how ridiculous that quest is LOL.
Is that why they put percentage in game
To hide the ridiculous number
That is our collective punishment for doing 2 person raid bosses within a week
Gotta funnel people in to crucible somehow
So basically it's all Trissin and Oathbreaker's fault
"Not gonna get started on grinding since it might get changed, don't wanna go through the MT experience again

Or at least until near the end of the season, for the title"
Wha
yeah I'm just trying to get the scout kills done first. i do think it was wrongly tuned and could end up getting changed but whatever progress i make on it whenever i play pvp is fine.
especially since i really don't have a ton of time now. I'm not gonna make myself crazy over it lol.
I have 3 midterms over the span of the next 36 hours
yup. i have one today and a big chunk of a project due tomorrow. then i have another essay due tuesday.
Good luck trissin and goal!
neither of which i have started bc everything got pushed out of the way bc of my midterm last night lmao.
Oof that scheduling
yeah all the while having practice every day and games fri/sat we love that for me💀😂
Wha how is Randy's my fault
You were too good at the game and Bungie had to take action
not my fault
i click heads mildly well
sitting here thinking about how i wish i could raid tonight but decided to be a student instead 😩
just picked up a taken armaments mod :BAblobby:
From Last wish?
2.0 taken armaments from wish?
luckyyyyyy
Oh heck we need to do Last Wish runs asap
"wait, was this your first wish since 2.0??"
Can we still cheese Riven?
second chest i opened using the free chest
i think i got my first taken armaments on my 24th run
hope I dont have to do another 20 runs for 2.0 taken armaments
"2.0 mod will only slot into ""outlaw"" mod slots"
I don't know what that means
The seasonal slot for season of the outlaw you mean?
I'd rather run CoS for hive armaments
and crown armor 2.0
I find hive and fallen armaments to generally be more useful
"for shadowkeep especially, hive armaments"
"However there should also be vex armaments now, yeah?"
"Can’t do tonight, throat is shot"
Can barely speak
"oh no, that sounds bad
hope you feel better @Rye"
It hurts
I’ll be fine in a few days methinks
alright Grimoire is 10/10. Though you can definitely tell which parts were written by professional authors and which parts by video game writers
Did this one come with a new emblem??
Yup it did
sweet! Which one?
if you happen to know the name of it
"Not yet lol, I redeemed it, but I'll find out which one it is when I log in tonight. I don't want to spoil myself!"
haha okay!
"There's a lot of lore from Forsaken in there, it's basically chronicles of the Fallen. Kinda sad too"
"@here raid goers for tonight. We have options:
1) grab a 6th
2) wait til the weekend or monday when everyone has divinity quest ready and goal has time
3) play iron banner instead at 850 power"
Now.......i’m thinking the 2nd option might be preferrable
I'm sure there must be someone wanting to hop in
who isn't busy
There’s no rush to do it tonight and it maybe best to hold off and wait for a better moment than rush it with not everyone confirmed and this and that
i'm like 923 at most so there's likely better options
923 is fine tbh
you won't have any problems oath
they hit a little harder but nothing you can't handle
Who all is available
I can be
i'm really in no rush to get divinity tbh. i don't have a lot of time to play now so when I'm on my main priority will be Undying stuff.
option 4) do a different raid
If our group does it tonight I don’t want to mess about with divinity memes and my titan is still 750 dogshit i’d just want to get it done. I know how bad it feels to have the checkpoint and then miss out because of going out of town so im personally ok with chilling so that we can finish it with our group. For whatever reason that’s a feelsbad to me.
"I don't mind chilling. We can just have a chill time...or Iron Banner if we want to drown this Discord in sweat, like you mentioned. Doesn't matter to me, though!"
I can do IB as IB doesn’t require me to talk
At least as much as a raid would
need people to help me do the Whisper of the Worm heroic mission
ya......i kinda have this disgusting urge to play ib tonight and raid sat night or sunday
"> I kinda have this disgusting urge to play ib
Yea, after a certain point, Crucible starts feeling...right. Stockholm from Randy's, I guess lol."
but is it really *right*?
"No, but it *feels* right"
"I can say with certainty, yes, it does to me : )"
tags: mindbreak
i remember i once did not play crucible for a literal entire season.
it was a glorious time.
How could it be glorious when you didn't earn any glory?
Checkmate
meanwhile I play PvE just to get gear for PvP
the glory unearned is just personal glory gained.
think about it.
the glory has to come from somewhere
but we don't know where exactly.
"The glory of keeping your sanity, perhaps?"
it remains an enigma.
I remember once I grinded for Claymore. I then didn't play crucible for an entire 3 seasons
it was fine
what about the glory of getting better? No? Just me?
^ I like that
but where does it come from
"getting better at what tho, exactly?"
real talk I like crucible
clicking heads
just wish it was balanced better. but I love it.
so you take it from others?
getting better at crucible? getting better at preserving sanity?
when you think about it
*whispers* we're all winners.
I think I got slightly better when I stopped using Blast Furnace/Jotunn and started using Austringer/Sole Survivor
I get said glory from a lack of sanity
when you stopped using the dad loadout @RonInDune
Sadly yes
reminds me
I need to go play Freelance so I can get NF
Hey guys Randy’s actually frags so
"Yeah Comp is very nice now, the only time I came up against sweats was just before Fabled"
Become the sweat Ron
Dust rock/energy hand cannon/whatever heavy is in style and go complain that pulses are OP
I want to finish up Luna's but getting 200 solar handcannon kills is hard
"I can't get the hang of Trust, and it's the only good solar I have"
Just the kills right and not headshots?
Yeah I think headshots is the next step
The worst part for me was I only had the explosive rounds trust and headshots weren’t always counting
it's just solar kills Ron
But you also have Erianas now so that should count?
"Yeah I might try out eriana's, though the recoil is even worse"
"It's either you're on the Hand Cannon kills which is any hand cannon, solar kills which is literally any solar damage kill, or hand cannon headshot kills"
I think it's solar hand cannon isnt it
Yeah I'm on the solar step
oh bloody hell
It's just a solar kill
I'm illiterate
Well back to Jotunn it is then
I'm 88% on solar kills. honestly this has a been a crutch more than hand cannon precision probably will be
"I want to do blink contraverse middle tree voidlock so much, but alas"
"if you can, get opening shot/targeting adjuster/enhanced hand cannon targeting combo"
Really helps getting the head shots
How much for you guys to carry me to Unbroken?
unbroken seems very easy this season
im already 2100+ and you saw me in iron banner
😛
bout tree fiddy
50 trees is a lot ron
the climate is changing
Yeah I know I hit fabled but I dunno where in fabled I am
"to fully answer your question, if you ever wanna queue comp lemme know"
(probably after these next couple weeks so power/raid/dungeon stuff is done)
Yeah for all the poop I talk about crucible I do find my way there a lot
"Probably after most of the Undying grind is done, only need the vanguard shader and emblem, 980 nightfall ship and leviathans breath"
(And all the offensive triumphs)
yeah. it looks like i'll be able to get on tonight after all. but i think i'd like to get that overlord in the hellmouth and probably just make progress on the gambit stuff.
speaking of 980 nightfalls anyone interested?
I'm down to try
is it even specified what the ship drops from? is it literally just the triumph for completing it?
And I’m always down to try. This week is good cause divinity disrupts and I have anti-barrier hand cannon rounds
well that is nice. i'm nowhere near being able to attempt that tho aha.
"""source: Complete the ""Beacon in the black"" triumph by completing nightfall: the ordeal on master difficulty."""
i am just getting all the vex offensive/seasonal triumphs for Undying done. i have a feeling i will end up having a couple of the collections stuff left after the season ends which i wouldn't mind.
just don't want to pass over a VO triumph and end up locking myself out of the title lmao.
I think the shaders and emblems May be season locked
oh yeah i just meant in terms of the ritual weapon and master NF.
Something @Arixama found out is killing guardians in gambit counts toward crucible stuff
His multikills while invading counted for the multikills quest step
oh interesting.
"yeah i just have like, no time now, which i hate. so rather than trying to level i'm just like, i'll get all this collection shit done lol."
"hey, i dunno what was happening for the garden tonight, but i dont think imma be on. ive got dinner and then i have study hall for a while. sorry guys! im like goal lol too much shit going on!"
"thats ok drake, we decided to postpone anyway since we were short people. everything worked out!"
yeah choosing to be a student can be hard sometimes.
"idk i've heard terms like ""academic weapon"" and ""team GPA raiser"" thrown around but i won't confirm nor deny. staying humble."
"Remember kids, it can always get worse"
"should i change my steam name to that. ""goal, but humble"""
"""Extraordinarily Humble"""
https://tenor.com/view/marvel-humble-drax-dave-bautista-guardians-of-the-galaxy-gif-14242314
wrap yourself in a blanket and youll be
a humble bundle
:guns:
literally the scene i was thinking of LOL
Marvel movies have collectively poisoned our brains lol
i won't complain about that hahaha.
hahaha he said it and it just popped right up! and there are worse things to have stuck in there!\
@Buttkikker id be down to attempt the 980 nightfall
we just have to clear it right?
Same here.
yeah its just to clear it
I’ll be home in about an hour if two others want to try the 980 haha
"If not I’ll just go match against Aztecross or something, idk he’s the last one on my list apparently"
@Infernosi me and ari are in voice chat
76561198075409104
ship acquired
"Bloody hell, congrats!!"
Anybody else around and want to try for it?
"protip, sychro izanagi shots are your friends"
And other forms of burst
In orbit and discord Peronix
@Crizum You want a third?
Would be nice haha
Otherwise we may try to duo
what PL should i ideally be for master nightfall?
"Probably at least 945 ish, I think"
The 950?
"oh mb, I thought that was 980"
whichever one gives the ship for Undying lol.
the ship comes from the 980 recommended
Honestly this is hilarious
This 980 strike
yeah so what PL can i be at that i won't  be a hindrance haha.
Uh Peronix is 950 and we may be able to swing it
960 is safer but still not safe
960 with Izanagi makes it okish
Hey @obsoleteXeo (Grebe) do you wanna grind some IB
any super efficient way to earn the points for Exit Strategy?
medals have been pretty efficient since i've only played a few matches so not concerned about that.
Smg kills I think risk runner
Do regular gambit for maximum motage
"General kills risk runner too, but if you are trying for the shaders and emblems reaper invader and sentry auras really help"
Don’t like regular gambit haha
"Prime has more powerful taken and those witches that spawn after every damage phase, which are needed for the shader/emblem quest"
oh riskrunner forgot about that aha. i'll do that thanks. more concerned with getting the ritual weapon rn rather than the shaders/emblem.
Shaders/emblem are needed for the Undying badge as well
We need more for this iron banner meme session haha
i would but i'm literally going to sleep rn haha.
pulled monte carlo :BAblobby:
It's a good gun!
"I wish it had more damage, but it makes Titans completely broken, so I'm for it"
@Peronix yes but I had discord memes muted so I missed your msg aaaannnd 2 hrs later rip
did you guys know that they murdered break neck
each stack of rampage does less damage
what the hell
"Yeah, and not just rampage. They toned down nearly all of the weapon damage buffs"
"Including kill clip, multi-kill clip, master of arms, etc"
Looks like we know why you can’t use random armor for ornaments
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dj1dl5/eververse_is_broken/ in the Halloween section
If they actually sell the season pass weapon ornaments for silver...
"I expect them to honestly. People are able to already have them, so people who don't have that kind of time to devote to the game having the option to just outright purchase them after a while makes sense."
That’s stupid
Unless I’m paying for recovs I don’t get to buy raid gear and pinnacles
i mean...it's just an ornament tho.
I get cosmetics but at a certain point why even play the game if you get to buy everything
Because it's for people who can't play the game a lot
"Yeah but the season pass is already filled with junk, taking away the few cool things it has just irritates me haha"
like personally i have never actually bought anything from eververse with silver and have never cared about ornaments so...lol.
"I already didn’t need five sets of the vex invasion stuff, they already have eververse ornaments that you can’t earn in game"
Though I’ll probably buy the EP armor from eververse so I shouldn’t talk :poker_face:
"like...i understand why they're doing what they're doing. i don't necessarily think it's great, but personally I'm indifferent."
"I guess like, I just remember when a cool set of armor meant you did the cool thing and not paid the blue lady space bucks?"
i agree. i mean...at least now you *know* someone paid for it tho haha.
and tbh i think the raid armor this season is great so.
I wanna see them eververse the trials armor and see what happens haha. And yeah the raid gear is nice but iirc it’s a prettied up version of the Osiris eververse set
yeah i don't like the cloak head on it so i just put an ornament on it. rest of it looks real good tho.
waiting until i have the whole set just need the chest and helmet. then i can put the precursor vex chrome shader on it and it looks like the chatterwhite shader from d1.
@Destiny [PC] ^ playing gambit tonight. the more the merrier lol.
What step in the quest for the shaders are you on goal?
farming that throwing knife in comp :<
I'm on the second shader.
"Thats guardians, right?"
but at 25% on guardians defeated after only a few matches last night.
so it's not that bad.
"Naw it isn’t I think Ari and I played for a few hours and I finished the second shader, emblem, and exit strategy"
Did you have an aura on or just normal?
just normal that was in regular gambit.
The auras are a pretty decent boost
I'm mostly just curious if they boost in regular gambit
what auras are for the second shader.
I think i only have collector and reaper bc i never cared about that season lol.
"Invader, and reaper is for the last two steps"
After guardians it's killing powerful taken
i can get the reaper aura. i assume prime is better for the emblem step then? for the envoys.
"Yeah, also you don’t need the armor since you can just use the synth and get a 30 minute boost"
yeah i only have 4 notorious pieces.
i end up using synths anyways they take up my inventory space lol.
I farmed out edgewise last night in the 950 ordeal nightfall using the forever spawning cave on nessus in failsafes area
That was a time
Was also a good place for the solar melee kills for the strike quest
@here anyone willing to help me out tonight with shattered throne? Need it done for my izanagi's burden (way behind the curve 😂)
"Lady Gaga: a woman of culture and class. we stan.
https://twitter.com/triplegcecil/status/1184573293606690817?s=19"
Any tricks for hitting 100k in nightfall?
I can't seem to get beyond 80 or so
What level you doing?
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dj6mst/you_can_reach_100k_on_hero_difficulty_in_this/ for this week on the 920
Otherwise find people for the 950
I was doing 920
Oh perfect thanks!!
"Damn 93k, so close"
"It's quite difficult on 920, yeah. Going to have to kill nearly every add, and complete the strike in good time too"
okay yall I'm getting on in about an hour if anyone wants to see if we can get that overlord in the Hellmouth...or at least have a public event spawn there 😂
and if there's not one there then I'm starting the gambit grind early lol.
just check between games
I'm down. Haven't so much as *seen* an Overlord yet:derp:
haha sounds good. yeah I'll play gambit and keep checking😂
literally reminds me of Whisper before they made it available all the time lmao.
"I never seem to get the overlord in Hellmouth, it never spawns"
CaBaL aGaIn?
"*gets Cabal public event for the third time*
""Welp, time to Cabawl my eyes out"""
Anyone want to try 950 for nightfall?
So Kevin Whitmeyer has started publishing the world art for Garden of Salvation: ||https://www.artstation.com/artwork/gJW8be||
It really is a incredibly beautiful raid
the music as you travel from encounter to encounter is amazing as well.
they really leaned into the theme of that salvation/wonder and absolutely nailed it all around.
"Yeah I genuinely love this raid, has to be among Bungie's best work ever"
Is the OST for the raid available already?
"I really want a raid on ||the pyramid|| that could lean in to a ||dark, paranoid vibe with reds and blacks with neon||"
Ooh that would be cool
"I also want something more on Titan, the arcology is severely underutilized"
"With like shadow versions of ||some of the most famous destiny weapons, imagine a dark mirror to Gjallarhorn or Khvostov||"
Also I'm kinda mad that when you replay the last story mission ||they don't play the cutscene with your doppelganger||
"The pyramid idea sounds *sick*. Maybe the farther along you are in the pyramid, the more twisted and dark things get"
"They always do big final bosses, but imagine you get to the final encounter and it’s ||a fireteam of dead guardians||"
"||The Pyramid architecture reminds me of Warmind/Rasputin, plus there is a lot of connection there if you read the lost sector lore||"
That'd be freaking amazing
Do the Mirror Knight fight from Dark Souls 2
Or that one fight from Demon Souls
||All the sound getting dampened in the pyramid like you're underwater was such a cool effect||
"Just have ||Zavala and Drifter|| narrate the thing, with two opposing views of how you proceed, really lean in to the ||dark or light? You need both|| they are playing with"
Oh hey I didn't know there was a Taikonaut postcard in the collector's edition
"Lmao the final encounter of ||pyramid raid|| is a ||fireteam of dead guardians||, time to ||switch to bottom tree striker|| and pull out the ||ace of spades, recluse, one-eyed mask|| let's go lool"
"That’s the thing Trissin, that’s the final boss"
Ace is bad now Trissin
||fireteam of six sweats with access to all pinnacles||
😮 it is??
Thorn is exotic hand cannon king lol
oh wtf lmao
Hey now what about Not Forgotten with the damage glitch
"It is in my opinion, it used to absolutely *map*"
"||Image if they make it like gambit, where you can queue into it to rolfstomp some poor guardians just looking to end the raid||"
Would the dead guardians be affected by the nerfs?
that would be so cool
A gambit styled raid would be amazing and terrible all at the same time
||you can play as the raid boss for other fireteams||
"As I said, make it like the ||mirror knight fight from Dark souls 2||"
"NF is weird just because the bug shouldn't exist, and even then, it only hits out to 32m then the bug gets fucky"
"Even with the hit to memento mori, doesn't it have crazy range?"
Basically all Hand Cannons are hard capped at 30m of range
"oh yeah thats right, all the range nerfs"
"Three ways of bypassing that are rangefinder, opening shot, and bugged mag howl"
"bugged mag howl on NF only right, not lunas?"
I don't count explosive rounds because that splits your damage so you're only dealing a portion of that rather than full damage
Does explosive payload get hit by range?
Oh ok
"No, bugged on both"
Luna's *and* NF
Is Sunshot still bad then?
Sunshot is eh?
I hear a mix of good and bad but the issue is that you're gonna lose an exotic slot
I'm like swashbuckler smgs now for close range
"It's nice cause it's slightly bugged I think, where it goes to x5 if you melee kill"
that's intended
swashbuckler stacks x1 if you get a gun kill with the swashbuckler weapon but instantly stacks to max if you get a melee kill with said gun equipped
yeah my swashbuckler moon smg was wrecking people even faster than recluse
though it was less range I think
Now that I’m done with Randy’s I want to build an arc melee build around monte carlo
Do it on Titan if you're gonna do that
"Of course, Titan is the way"
use Liar’s Handshake and top tree arc
on hunter
with x3 Combination Blow you'll wreck bosses
With arc battery and synthoceps for the range
"Thundercoil, you mean?"
Yeah my bad
Arc Battery is the overshield
"oh yeah, that one shots in pvp doesnt it?"
i saw a clip on reddit of someone getting 7th col with that
With bottom tree I think once you get that first kill yes
Thundercoil? When stacked with Frontal Assault
that's kind of dumb
but I guess it's not something a shotgun cant deal with
You’re still in prime shotgun range
might wanna check it out PVPers
@Destiny [PC] i'm on now if people wanna play gambit/wait for a PE to spawn in the hellmouth lol.
nooooooooooo RIP ||one-two punch peregrine||
"Kind of a long wall of text, but pretty notable change incoming for armor 2.0 + mods:"

Who in our clan has the best fashion game?
I know @Arixama is pretty on fleek
"This is some handy bug fix, but it's going to prevent some cheeses sadly:"
There's cheese associated with this?
"Remember if you have one person constantly opening inventory before loading in, in a timed mission like whisper/zero hour, the timer doesn't start"
Guys get your fashion game on:

ohhhh nice!
lucky you
"Asher Mir has such hate for Titans, but perhaps if he had one on his fireteam instead of two hunters he wouldn’t have lost an arm :p"
If he had waited until D2 he would have had a healing rift.  That might have prevented the loss of his arm.
"I just love ambient dialogue and the lore, because somehow titans are both the dumbest things walking around yet also the most tactically minded"
"“Titans dumb punch rocks, also Zavala is a military genius”"
zavala is dum
Just saying. I have a healing rift and haven't lost a limb yet and we have been neck deep in vex lately.
I feel bad for Asher because according to the lore he's extremely depressed and basically suffering from PTSD. Wish his dialogue actually reflected any of that
I’d feel worse for Asher if he didn’t sound surprised that I could walk upright every time I grabbed bounties haha
I love the changing dialogue depending on your class though. That mission on edz with him and sloane I think it is?
yeah that was pretty funny if you decide to not blow stuff as a titan
Kinda wish the side characters got some more screen time
Have you submitted it?
Here's my fave Asher lore pieces:

Lol isn't the inspiration for that a set of **very NSFW** yugioh inspired cards featuring Barney the dinosaur?
oh is it
i didnt know that lmao
im kinda scared to search it up
"I didn't know either, until reddit very wisely informed me"
"Trissin, thats such a good screenshot"
"ah, the wonders of the internet"
actually a friend sent this to me lol
but im pretty sure she also got it from somewhere else

yeah im not clicking that
be careful about clicking the comments lol
it
im in a public space rn
it's just the original reddit post
ohhhhh ok
The bottom tree striker nerf has been a long time coming
https://imgur.com/a/DY07MXI
So what becomes the big complaint after this and the inevitable one eyed mask nerf?
spectral hunters again?
Best guess is handheld supernova
erianas vow probably
or maybe nova locks
two people teamshoting with erianas is an insta kill no matter what
even body shot
So is two people with a sniper.
can't wait to finish out those gambit things tomorrow night lol. was fun playing tonight and making all that progress tho.
"well, i finally got to 1981 glory after some serious comp effort yesterday. I'm not touching it lol, waiting for Tuesday to roll around; too many horror stories of people pushing it and going back to 1600... nope, not me, not gonna do it.  now the climb for mountaintop 🙄"
Nice!!! Congrats 👊
Comp grind is not a fun one
ty 🙂 trying to broaden my collection and get a few meta pieces so i can raid with yall
"@thegoaliebear @Arixama @RonInDune @Peronix @Crizum Thoughts on availability for this weekend of boss checkpoint? I have tonight available, laaaaaate Saturday night, and all of Sunday"
Sunday is best for me. i get back late tonight from my game so am just gonna finish my gambit quests.
Anyone up for Friday night GoS raid?
Sunday is best day. Gives us a ton of time and no pressure for sleep I feel cuz we can start earlier
"@Lonk i would love to, it'd be my first time.  If you're ok with me possibly making a mistake and have an empty slot, i'm decently geared atm, 950 light."
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) if those who didn't have it get the divinity quest going we could also just finish the boss checkpoint we have an do another fresh run after.
ah I should probably start the divinity quest
"i've barely gotten to play this season, wish i could be more active"
"it's not too long, is it?"
"no it's not too bad, i don't think anyway, i passively did most of it up to GoS and didn't realize it"
it's not long. probably takes 15-20 mins to get to the GoS part. maybe not even that long.
"oh wow lol, that is short yeah"
@thegoaliebear ya I’ll work on that tonight
I like that. The first 3 encounters are just so quick that’d be dope
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) Sunday works best for me, have d&d tonight and a friends birthday tomorrow night but I can make Sunday happen anytime"
Also have warlock and hunter geared up for a second run if people want to do that for divinity
If you see me on and need a spot filled hit me up.
if the time is too early we can always adjust it but this is just to have everyone in one place for Sunday.
"There was only one other person who was interested in doing today, so i'll jus..."
nevermind
i saw there's dibs
Anyone know what the rolls are on Xûr's stuff today? Especially the shards and for transversives
It’s whatever the roll in your collections is
Hopefully they curate collections a little better for stuff like actium/oathkeepers/lucky pants
Unless it was intentional because you can use the expensive multi-weapon mods
@Lonk can always make an lfg post for tonight. that run is for sunday.
🤷 i asked and only 1 responded so i'm guessing lfg would be low results just be an alt for sunday
"Doesn't hurt, maybe some people just haven't checked discord yet. Busy with work, classes, etc during the day"
"I might even be able to join tonight, depending on practice + assignments"
and can always do the @.Destiny[PC]. people are morely likely to check when they get a ping for it.
all very good points
||I just feel awkward making an lfg if it doesn't fill up||
happens a lot to all of us haha. it's just a good way to organize people into one place tho.
"Lol it's good, I get what u mean

Worst case is just push to another time, or just LFG the remaining slots"
i would love to run GoS this weekend or tonight
on all three chars even lol
Idk about clearing it thrice
"Yeah the one I made we cleared in didn’t fill up, we got lucky and asked in discord/clan chat and found a 6th @Lonk"
LOOOT
idk if ill even be free
But I hope so!
@thegoaliebear honestly if ppl are available earlier that’s cool too.
I’ll be on probably 2:00pm onward est
Got my pin! That was super fast
"what's a good light level to be at for the raid? I want to start running it soon, but I also don't want to be a burden to everyone haha"
Like 930-940ish
"Nice, just hit 930"
"damn everybody's climbing, I'm still like 920 lol"
"Nah you have midterms and such, focus on those. Destiny will be here no matter what"
"Unless the world ends tomorrow, in which case oh well"
hahaha tru
"but little did u know, midterms and other exams are **also here no matter what**"
I swear I've had at least 1 midterm or significant test every week for the last like 5 weeks
I spent 4 hours today proctoring two tests and I'm dreading having to grade them lol
"us students complain about midterms and evaluations and such, but I can't even imagine having to grade them"
that sounds like so much work
"I finally finished most of my midterms and get my day of fall break today, so I'll be on a bit this weekend."
Piotr Jabłoński published part of his art from Grimoire Volume II: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qAXdlz
It's pretty good!
"For anyone going for the vanguard shaders and emblems, the five of swords strikes work for it, but you can’t put on brawler or grenadier anymore. Shouldn’t be a problem if you have any weapons with demolitionist or a Monte Carlo"
no more brawler/grenadier on the challenge card???
They took out literally every positive modifier from 5 of swords
Yuuuuup
Probably to stop the farming
Which is really dumb if you ask me
You don't get any good loot other than strike loot
"Yeah it won’t help the score portion, but I’m at like 75% for solar ability kills and done with the other two so rather than fight two others for kills just load up a solo strike. Though I guess you could just melee with an empty sword during the 950 nightfall"
love when all I wanted to do was play some d2 tonight but we get stuck with mandatory recovery :)))
"Feel your pain. Gotta get up at 6 and work til prob 8pm tomorrow. But gotta get that green, nah mean? But its chill. Today was a great day to get stuff done and now relax. Plenty of destiny tomorrow night and sunday 👍"
yeah i should probably start writing my essay tomorrow lol. crank out a draft of it after my game. sunday will be a destiny day tho.
"I don't know what mandatory recovery is, but it's good you're getting rested!"
haha no we had to stay at the rink an extra hour when we could have already been home and sleeping lmao.
it was awesome.
What the heck I just realized there's a new strike on Io
When did that happen ??!!??
eris narrates it so shadowkeep
I had no idea somehow dang
welp I've been above 950 for a few days now and I'd like to do the raid but haven't really had the time to do it
is anyone wanting to do the raid and/or guide me and my friend through it
sometimes this weekend probably
i know lots of us are always down to help with a raid if the time works out. we have a full run on sunday but worth seeing if people are available tomorrow maybe.
tomorrow would be good
"i would definitely like to join, but it would be my first time and i need an adult to go with me"
^^ but since challenge mode is gone i dont imagine it'll be that hard
I'd be down for anytime this weekend.
Would anyone be interested in a heroic menagerie run tomorrow night? Possibly for flawless boss but mostly for catalyst. It’s great to have in the new raid.
":S had to stay late as well, didn't get to log on"
"I'm always down to sherpa raids, but I'm away this weekend for a competition"
life always getting in the way of a good time 😉
right?? :((
"what kind of competition, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Ofc, no worries! An archery tournament against another university"
"Not big or anything significant, more of like a friendly shoot"
but standard rules and stuff still apply
awesome 😄 i'm a bow hunter and have always loved archery! never done it competitively but i know taking 100 shots a day takes some working up to lol.  Seems there's a specific muscle in the shoulder that only gets used when drawing a bow.
@Waffles i would love to but i only have 2/4 keys in the mysterious box at this point.  I'll make a hell of an effort tomorrow to get IB and hopefully go with you
"time for bed though, g'nite yall"
Night!!
IT. IS. DONEEEE.
he was up until almost 5am grinding this thing
i would never have that much resolve with pvp lmao.
"@thegoaliebear was me, him and a few others that were playing pvp"
started to get like 11% per game with fusion rifles
wish i had the time of day.
"@Waffles don’t know what I was thinking last night, can’t do 2 diff forges in one day and therefore can’t have the IB to join you.  Speaking of forges, I thought they were supposed to rotate each day; is that not true anymore?"
each week i believe.
"They should be daily, in about 13 minutes it should switch"
but you also don't need izanagis to do heroic menagerie. can just do it for funsies now that we aren't under the level.
Yeah kinda just want the catalyst for GoS
coming from someone who never even bothered to get the gun in the first place lol...not necessary 😂
but heroic menagerie is fun. if we can get a full team I'd hop on tonight for that.
Awesome!! Hopefully we can
"@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) until you can get Izanagi’s if you want you can farm the moon sniper rifle Tranquility, it can roll with firing line"
@Crizum apparently izanagi's questline is fixed now
dunno for sure
"Hopefully yeah, but I just mean if he can’t get it today and needed something for the slot for whatever reason, it also frees up an exotic spot"
"Good news, everyone! Got off work early so will probably run some quests/pvp in a bit. Would like to do a nightfall at 950 100% and maybe try 980. My drops are at 950 now but I still know that’s a stretch"
"Prob want to finish Exit Strategy as well and then vex incursion triumph memes too. Basically, feel free to add me on steam and msg if you wanna play if you see me on soon."
Might stream as well
"I just saw this

Id still recommend Izanagi's, other snipers are also good but I think Izanagi's is noticeably better"
Oh I love Izanagi’s but talking to @thegoaliebear about it is like this scene
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0
"Izanagis also occupies your kinetic slot, leaving your energy open to recluse or whatever you wanna run in that slot, I don't know what you like"
"otherwise you can get tranq, or farm a good Sole Survivor which can also roll firing line"
in case you wanted to run something like riskrunner
you could run tranq with it
izanagis is a slap machine tho
"I haven’t run it yet but I just got a love and death with spike grenades and full court, no auto-loading but it’ll be nice to not need orbs for wendigo"
I’ll see how it fares in garden tomorrow
anyone down for raid???
old raids too even
any
raiders in the chat
Not home or would go for one of the shorter ones
I was hoping to do nightfall at 100k
Maybe 920
well I've been doing just fine without izanagis lmao.
but do we have anyone who would want to do heroic menagerie tonight aside from me and @Waffles ? @Destiny [PC]
@Kronohs you can't get 100k at 920 unfortunately
some say im religious
some would say im an anglo shaxxon
@rozak oh really? That sucks. I got to 93k once and thought it was doable
we were cutting it close at 103k in a 950
"Chance, you wouldn’t happen to be a big Michael Shaxxon fan would you?"
@thegoaliebear I'm down for heroic menagerie. Is it any different from regular menagerie besides difficulty?
I need to do the heroic
Ok anyone down for legend nightfall & 950?
I could go for the 950 if we can find one more
Awesome! Any other takers?
I can do it.
I'll probs be on around 9:30 est for heroic menagerie.
hopped in to ft alpha chat @Kronohs
gotta love iron banner
going against a 5 stack with 2 unbrokens
I like how you need to play 50 gambit matches to get the Eriana's Wow catalyst then having the catalyst itself require 1 k kills.
: )
i heard you like grinds
haha just kill me already
the catalyst perks are nice and all but fuck is that a rediculous grind
"On a positive note tho, managed to get both exit startegy and hush in 50 gambit matches"
ima flex real quick
got erianas catalyst
👀
@Buttkikker nice 😄
did you sell your soul
whats a soul
all i have is destiny
though big applause to all who have randys
"Yeah I suffered through Randy’s first, makes everything else seem easy"
"I'm down for menagerie if you want a noob 🙂 still working on getting IB but i haven't done any raids in the game so far.  I'll look up a video on heroic menagerie and make sure i've got the gear for it... cancel that, i've done menagerie lol, just not heroic"
it's not hard at all especially since we're all well over level for it.
"well, fair warning, i died quite a bit my first time in there.. went in total green"
it's fine not like we're going for flawless lol. but i will be on maybe closer to 10 est. have a teammates birthday to go to for a bit.
"cool cool, i'll get the applicable clan bounties now and be round doin stuff and things till then"
welp i guess i might as well run my titan and warlock through shadowkeep at this point
got nothing better to do
ITS DONE
RANDYS IS DONE
IM NEVER PLAYING CRUCIBLE AGAIN
*Randy's grasp loosens...until next season*
May have miscalculated how long i would be stayong at this party.
Party > Destiny
still debating whether I'm gonna go out or not haha.
https://tenor.com/view/cheers-gif-7397911
"All good, I’m not home yet"
I swear to drunk officer I'm not God
well if i don't go out...drunk destiny is always fun.
seriously though Party > Destiny
For like 85% of the time
Did you say drunk sparrow racing?
"When you're old and decrepit and decaying into sand, Destiny will still be there, but parties won't"
drunk raid
drunk raid would be hilarious
take a shot every wipe anyone?
drunk raid pls
i just want to friggin raid but drunk raid would be great
all the alcohol in my apt won't drink itself.
Unfortunately I can't join in the drinking but I can be the chaperone!
some people say we have a drinking problem but i think people just have a problem with our drinking
All my raids are drunk raids
be my desigbated driver  @RonInDune
But what raid and when is this happening lol
I always am lol!!
last wish
Haha 😂
Remind me to record everything and play it back at the most important moments of your lives
So..... I'm hearing drunk raid stream /s
i once made myselg black out from playing destiny after drinking too much at pregamd.
did i still go out?
absolutely.
"i'm in full party mode myself, and because i'm decrepit and decaying, party mode consists of an energy drink, and townhouse crackers with philly buffalo dip AND spinach artichoke.  Livin on the wild side"
very wilds.
2 down
im almost done with my exit strat
9% to go on the score
I was grinding for malfeasance and just happen to almost finish it
The only things i need for undying now are leviathans breath and to kill the undying mind 3 times
"i need randy's and to finish the vangaurd quest, plus those 2 things"
i wanna go for the garden of salvation seal
that title is all kinds of wack.
i dont even care too much for the vanguard one and ill get randy's eventually
if i ever use a scout rifle
likely will just be Undying for me this season.
randys looks so good
im hyped for it
i never want to play vex offensive again
or a bow
"heheh, it takes some determination that's for sure.  I've got about 2/3 of auto and fusion to go in offensive.  just got telesto and was like ""sweet, this is gonna make the fusion multikills so much easier"" and just like that, no it's not 😛"
i will be alive for this lmao.
still hangin in there huh?
lol yeah I'm really more tired than anything.
"i feel ya, energy drink has lost it's perks, dip is back in the fridge... close to wrapping up the red war legacy campaign though 🙂 kinda crappy there's no exotic rewards in it, but i really enjoy the story, and I'm now in love with Cayde as well.  TBH I wanted to know why Cayde is so beloved more than anything"
he also had a lot of involvement in d1 with the story arcs. developed his character pretty well.
"wow, so there's even deeper history! I thought these characters were all D2... kinda bummed i missed out on D1 now"
haha yeah it's all carried over from d1.
we have several lore geeks here and many story arcs we have now were started even way back in D1Y1.
"wish i had started this game sooner, it's got a really good mix of pvp, pve, and mmo elements.  I'm starting to geek on the lore too"
"you can get sucked into the world very easily for sure. i legit have like, an emotional attachment to my hunter😂"
"oh yeah, he may not say much, but I'm pretty proud of my warlock at this point.  not gonna lie, i put on some shaders and spend an awkward amount of time thinking to myself how badass he looks"
Making your Guardian look badass is the true endgame
"i've got a bit to go on that one lol, stats rule and can't be too picky. I've seen some really cool stuff on others though, and look forward to it"
"Stats? What are those? Cooler it looks, the better it is, right?😂"
you might be able to get away with it but i need my +3 mobility so i can make it to the nearest titan and beg them to make the bad guys go away
"""do the punchy thing, do the punchy thing!"""
*Bubble please!*
You absolute madlad!
got bored
Besides GoS there really isnt too much to do
and besides GoS i don't have time for much else today :/
hoping this week will be a bit lighter on the school work. we have a road trip to Princeton so i won't be on thursday-saturday. but would be nice to have all of sunday to grind out some stuff.
Speaking of GoS I can be on whenever if people wanted to start earlier
7 is likely the earliest i could be on.
i don't mind starting earlier if people can. just gives us more time to get the clear lol. I'd definitely like to do another run after tho maybe on my titan.
"Yeah would be nice, also sucks you actually do need a flawless run for the title haha"
Yeah I got my Hunter to 956 last night so i'm down for two runs
my titan is like...922 i think? but with transferring weapons he can be ~930 so he would be fine for a second run.
It's crazy how fast levelling is if one character is 950 plus
i also don't think i'll be going for the raid title this season. unfortunately just do not have the time to dedicate to those triumphs this time around.
I probably won't be on tonight due to a surprise visit from family. Sorry guys!
@Chance and I have a great need to do vault of grass before the reset
Does the menagerie give powerful drops anymore?
i don't believe so. but i think it will drop at your PL.
so it's still useful to round out a slot that might be dipping behind.
Hmm yeah that's what I wanted to do. Thanks!
yeah if i can get on before the raid tonight i will do that as well. it is so nice to be able to curate what you get haha.
Also buying silver on steam is a bit finicky
I keep getting errors
"Reload the game and see if it worked, or if you got charged for it."
"When I bought silver, Steam was saying that it didn't work, but I got charged for it and the silver was on my account"
The only time I've ever had steam in game transactions go right was for R6S and Warframe
yeah that's what ended up happening to me too
Buying the Dota 2 immortals and stuff went smoothly but I've never rbought anything else
@Lonk peronix might not be able to make our GoS run tonight so we may need someone to jump in. you have first alt spot so lmk if you'll be available just in case!
okay i'm at 4/5 pages for this essay i'll finish that shit tomorrow 😂
"@Buttkikker would you mind being my sherpa, or is this a fast run (assuming you aren't needed in main raid)?"
or is that main raid?
Just a casual run i need to learn it myself so youre welcome to join
woot 😄
"@thegoaliebear yeah i should be free, but if it goes over 4 hours I’d need to leave"
i won't stay on that late either lol. we should be able to make it through tho.
"Are we still on for our raid tonight? That's at......8 est right? Is the play to ONLY do the 4th encounter (i would be totally cool with that), or are we doing the 4th encounter THEN doing a divinity run?"
"I don't have a second character to make the drops worthwhile after we finish the first run. Personally, I would be appreciative of just nailing down that 4th encounter and then giving new dry runs next with w/ divinity, w/ other classes.....etc"
my plans drastically changed today and i am only now just getting on so I still haven't done divinity quest 😦
"You should have time, I think the goal is finish the last encounter and do a new run on some peoples alts while  triggering divinity"
for everyone who is wanting to do the other GoS lfg go ahead and hop in to the raid chat and we'll see if we can get this going
you mean vault of grass
@here anyone else interested in a GoS run?
@rozak WHERE ARE YOU
Wait the raid tonight isn't just a standard run? It's a boss checkpoint and then divinity run?
We're starting in an hour right?
I thought it was a fresh standard run so if you can get either other alts to fill in that'd be cool but if you really need someone I can do the first boss rush
it looks like buttkikker is still an alt. still unsure of peronix's status but i'll let you know what ends up happening.
I am not gonna be able to get divinity quest done in time rip
i don't mind starting like 8:15 ish if needed.
messing around with stream things
don't you have to kill a lot of vex? literally haven't started
It’s like one run of the vex invasion
And three lost sectors
k ima try real quick but idk
I'll be on in roughly 25 mins sorrry
alright I'm loggin in now will be ready in a couple
LF1M for Leviathan last 2 encounters
@Lonk it looks like we'll need one more. would you want to join?
@Destiny [PC] need one more for boss encounter of GoS. just doing the boss so experience preferred for this.
"I'd join in, but I don't have experience with that one. And I heard it's a bitch and a half"
we can have you on a motes team it is simple enough. and you are leveled fine for it.
@LW Mugetsu any interest in doing final boss of GoS?
"If y'all still need one more person, I'll be back sooner than expected (around 10 minutes), if that's cool"
Yeah still have a spot
"idk why y'all cant hear my mic, hold on"
is it plugged in
AT&T is so good
@here anyone for boss of GOS
we need 1
Thanks again for the GoS clear tonight fam. Was really wanting that after missing out last week. And great job! That was very clean
of course👍 was good to get another clear in. I'll set up an lfg tomorrow for tuesday night. maybe we can get the whole run in and get divinity.
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tomorrow night. will be getting divinity as well. experience not necessary we can teach the raid but at least have watched a video of the encounters if you join!
what kind of meme load out should i go with tomorrow night. was thinking i might fuck around and use a linear fusion for damage.
*A Rat King-only run*
i accept.
Let's do it. Who needs to work on their catalyst?
"I only got Rat King on PS4, so I need to do the quest real quick"
alright I'm going with Pluperfect/Every Waking Moment/Edgewise for tomorrow lol. then darci for the bosses dps.
Sweet business/uriels gift/avalanche for me
absolutely love that.
Quest willing I'll do raid bow/hush/leviathans breath
solid.
Do pinacle rewards only drop at +1?
It's going to take forever to get to 960 then
yeah it's a slog.
The charity event details are out: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48353
Random question: When does season of the undying end?
it's on the in game season pass i think in like 50 days or smth ??
"I love that ghost shell, I hope it has decent perks."
Hundred dollar donation? Glimmer extractor
I faced this absolute unit of a titan in Iron Banner today:
"Speed demon+guiding light, complete with 300+ comment reddit post about how bs it is"
That man has no neck Ron
utterly magnificent
Also poor guy kept getting two tapped cause he was so low light
Iron Banner?!
That dude has the largest of testicles
He harbors an immense power I don’t want to face
he was so ... shiny
finally finished revoker
im pissed. We got the last boss of the raid down to like 1% or even less hp last night
never got to finish it
im determined to kill this finicky asshole of a boss
could someone please tell me who in the right mind decided to make the portals for the boss spawn relative to the bosses position? I can't tell you how many portals spawned BEHIND him best he was turn to the side
"rip, I feel u Chance"
Or could someone tell me why the tether mechanic so so damn finicky? Why can we just target who we want the tether to go to. Love wiping because the tether decide to go into africa
OR could someone tell me why theres essentially a time limit to depositing motes before the dps phase
if the dps phase starts and you try to deposit motes it wont fill
"Wasn't quite as low as your ~1% but i definitely agree with some of your other points, they frustrated me on day 1"
once i get home Im gunna see if i can find a group for it and try a  different strat
"portal spawn rng is a bit annoying, and the tether behaving weirdly is also just confusing"
I just dont understand why they kept it like that
For the dps phase thing all I can offer is don’t kill the angelic until people are banked
it makes the boss unreasonably difficult
"as for the motes thing, I think it sorta makes sense
a timer pushes your team to work quickly so you can't take your sweet time"
and if you can't deposit during DPS phase maybe it's the angelic? but other than that idk
its odd idk I know we had enough right when dps phase started but the tether just didnt work. and the text notification didnt pop when we banked
also it seems like the tether doesnt work when you take damage either
which is also really dumb
Goblins can sacrifice and pull motes out
"I've only done the boss once, and I did with with some folks here in our clan

but we also saw some weird stuff, like floors going invisible, people's characters freaking out and like vibrating"
we had to back to orbit and go back
its a fairly buggy raid
"Which blows but that’s probably what happened, they don’t have to finish sacrificing just starting it is enough"
OH we had the weirdest stuff happen to
i dunno abou that one @Crizum
I think they do have to finish
my friend randomly just died instantly and his body flew to space and his revive was back at the banner location
we were like halfway through the fight too when that happened
it made no sense
might've been land being taken/recovered
"or going invisible, as it does sometimes"
idk
it's wack
we also had an issue where we reached dps phase and I think someone accidently hit one of the portal spots and it put a portal on top of one of the platforms you need to connect the tether to the box
"we had people going underground the map on my first run, and we were power-checked"
so it teleported me away
lots of glitches
that encounter is just wack
"Oh man haha, yeah we had to have goal not use tether cause if the boss got too close he’d have both portals come out which we only realized once two cyclops came to the party"
"Tethers are super wonky, they will always prioritize people over where you want them to actually go, ricochet rounds seem to proc them a bunch"
"you might also get a bug where it just straight up ignores you. you could be the only one standing there, and the cube/tethered players just dont tether to you"
yikes I really dont think bungie dedicated enough time to these mechanics
they're far too finicky
My favorite was the boss T posing for a solid minute before registering as dead
"I mean, the boss encounter is a bit buggy, yeah, but I think overall the raid is actually quite good"
every raid has had it's problems
something else I've been wondering too since I kinda quit for a while after curse of osiris is what is with bungies obsession with parkour? It's kind weird having to do an obstacle course between encounters in a raid
leviathan didn't have that at all unless you're doing keys in the underbelly
the lair did tho
because jumping puzzles are the true endgame
"I like it, makes it more engaging than “walk from room to room killing”"
I mean I do enjoy watching the people who cant parkour fall to their death a bunch of times
They had it in vault to an extent and in Kings fall
Actually I think leviathan is the only outlier really
so it seems
i just realized i never got to finish the last encounter of crown either
zzz
i would raid and sherpa a lot more if i werent so busy gahhhhh
"I want to do garden a lot more, for the weapons + armor"
I think I need to be sherpa'd though. I feel like the loadouts/strats for the encounters are probably very different from whatever wack stuff my team did on day 1
I just want enhanced mods again dammit.
saladins handing them out like candy
Oh I'm aware
Just being potato light level means I don't want to touch IB with a 10ft pole
didnt they fix the map rotation of IB it doesnt seem like it
i only played a few more though since it's kinda buttcheeks
@Oathbreaker if you can find two others to do it the 920/950 ordeal nightfalls drop those at a decent rate as well
"sorry i had to bounce last night @Chance , wish i could've been there we so would've gotten it in the first try 😉 wife and i have a little one on the way and morning sickness has been plaguing her.  I try to make things easier on her when i can and she had to be up pretty early today so i called it a night."
no worries m8 we all got a life that takes priority over bideo games
but man was that boss frustrating
it does... stupid life
"sounds like it, can't wait to bang my head against that wall lol"
"Hats off to those going for worlds 1st in that place... man, going in blind and figuring out all those tethering mechanics and team splits on the fly is pretty friggen impressive"
@Destiny [PC] anyone in here want to do the last encounter of the raid? I have a grudge to settle
"afraid i'm busy with assignments atm, but best of luck! give the boss a good thrashing for me as well please"
doing quest for thorn atm
"lol @Arixama I rewatched the end of that game where my bounty didn't complete, and I was tilted lmao"
and sleepy
welp i found a squad and we beat his ass first try
we had some odd glitches going on though but we still managed to down him
almost one phased him too
yeah he can be a bit glitchy. we've had that happen on a number of boss attempts. but nice job on the clear.
"My biggest fear rn is the Leviathan's Breath quest involving a ""final blows in Crucible with bow"" step"
Oh god don’t fucking say that PLEASE
"I wouldn't mind that, I like my lemon. Those who played clan matches with me a while back might remember lol"
it doesn't. quest steps were leaked i can try and find the link. even tho it's not 100% confirmed the steps are too indicative of it being leviathans breath.
it's bow kills in gambit or strikes i believe.
inb4 it becomes entirely pvp as datamining punishment
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/leviathans-breath-quest-steps%3famp
nah.
Calus loves us too much to make us play pvp.
not even kills in a specific activity. only bow kills are precision kills against cabal and vex. last step is a remastered arms dealer strike.
Still not celebrating until we see the steps. Remember “solar week”?
Then again everyone using bows in crucible would probably be hilarious
it's possible some things could be different. but doubt it'll have much if any involvement in pvp.
"Honestly, if it involves bows in PvP, I just won't get it. simple as that."
randys was enough to force people back into pvp.
I don't even enjoy bows as a weapon type (not that they should be removed from the game or anything) but I just can't enjoy them at all
a heavy bow might turn out to be fun. doubt it'll have much use in endgame stuff.
Le Monarque is pretty enjoyable
"The use is spelled out in the perk, good against unstoppable champions"
So if they have barrier and unstoppable you’ll probably be using it with anti-barrier recluse
"See.... they're slow, unwieldy snipers that have draw time *and* aren't hitscan. I'd much rather just have a sniper in both PvP and PvE"
mhm...theres definitely niche uses for them which is nice. but overall they're just pretty underwhelming compared to the other stuff we have.
"I don't think you can put mods on exotics though, can you?"
"I don't think bows are *good* necessarily, but they feel perfect to use for me somehow"
"No, it’s part of its package"
ohhh mbmb
Might just be a bUngie thing
In the same way Divinity disrupts haha
"Divinity does work on overload champions, people tend to forget those exist in the nightfalls I run and they just go crazy on people"
"So if we have a hive nightfall with Unstoppable Ogres that’s the use for Leviathans Breath. Which is cool, I think they realize if they have godlike exotics that just becomes the meta, so spreading a few of them out over more niche uses ensures people play around with them"
Can’t boss burn with Izanagi’s times 3 if you need to cover the various champions
yeah honestly i like that. it makes you need to have a more optimized team for certain activities.
Y'all let me know how the quest is once it comes out
lmao i wish i could. I'll probs have just enough time to get it started before the raid.
I got class at 2 so
No quest for me
Is divinity still busted against the raid boss?
Busted how?
Gives it increased armor so you actually do less damage. I think that's what the problem was
"Oh wow haha have no idea, Ron was using it on our run so hopefully not"
idk considering we damaged over half his health first phase i couldn't tell ya 🤔 😜
well my 1230 class was cancelled so i can at least pick up the leviathans breaths quest before my next class lol.
"Not sure if it’s cause we won, but one gambit prime match got us 35% on that quest step"
any nightfall is 50%
i'm hopping on real quick now to grab the quest. where exactly do i go in the tower to get it?
Gambit is also 2% on erianas bow so double dipping
"At Banshee, after that go to the hanger"
Yeah a loss is 25%
so what i'm getting is that step goes real quick.
"Yeah, and so far lines up with the data mined info"
Haha you can’t type Tangled Shore?
If you type in tangled shore it’s shows up tangled s****
that's incredibly funny lol
Also typing trigger it shows up tr***
I didn’t realize profanity filter was set to auto on so I turned it off
I also apparently glitched Hawthorne and she is at 40% for my weekly and I’m capped on her xp
ok got to the bow precision kills step so not bad.
if i can hop on before the raid i'll get that step going if not i'll just do it tomorrow.
"Big brain, the raid is all vex and that step is vex or cabal"
Anyone acquired the weapon yet? please tell me how it feels
Streamers did it on Nessus lost sectors
On the strike step currently
Oh shit it matchmakes
yeah i was thinking of just farming out the nessus lost sector in artifacts edge...figured the quest would be relatively short considering they released it later into the season.
Still have necrophage too
"hitting crits on Vex is a right pain, the Cistern with its Cabal are another option"
"I just loaded up the leviathan, endless cabals"
if it's not needed for a title i want then i don't worry about it lol.
wait wait wait
divinity gives it armor???
yeah its bugged.
DAMIT
"Wait, I thought it just lowered the crit modifier"
@Chance we could have done it that one run
IT HAD LIKE 1% HP
I know that feels
rip that run
well time to grind for bow
that run was rip
we got our kill last night tho
This bow is pretty nice
Think I’ll run in it garden tonight and see how it feels
"The Divinity bug isn't confirmed, especially in GoS"
sanct is definitely fine
think at this point dps in garden isn't an issue anyways lol.
but i guess I'll find out when i use a linear fusion bad boy against the sanctified mind tonight.
i really love the feel of leviathans breath
Reddit's complaining that it one shots everything in PvP but is kinda meh in PvE?
reddit's always complaining
Truest words ever spoken
I'm glad it's a good bow though
"OMG, i've been training for this moment for all my... past week and a half!"
"For PvP it’s a heavy, most heavies one shot haha"
“This fucking wardcliff kills me in my super? What garbage”
its kinda lame in pve
"of course its going to one shot in pvp, its pretty much the same damage archetype as a rocket launcher"
"We’ll see more testing come out I’m sure, but the only way it feels lacking to me is when you compare it to Izanagi, but that’s taking in to account a catalyst honed edge shot"
So I was watching people run heroic menagerie and 3 people got hive armaments in one flawless run
They might've buffed drop rates
oooo
i need the sword anyways
Also the strat seemed pretty safe
which boss is it this week?
big flying vex guy
in the raid starting chamber
oh that one is easy for flawless.
just need to be on top of those cyclops.
"I don't know if flawless if even difficult anymore, considering we can be like 950"
it might scale you down but i honestly don't know lol. i'd imagine it's hella easy now tho.
Yeah it seems way less stressful now
the ogre took me a couple tries
regular menagerie is still actually kind of difficult depending on modifiers.
"also as far as mods go, since theyre unlocks now theres only so many runs you have to do to get the mod you want"
regular menagerie difficulty is proportional to how bad your randos are
^ ya
@Destiny [PC] anyone in here wanna do a crown of sorrow run
afraid I don't have the time to dedicate
but good luck!
not sure if i can tonight or not but id be down this week for sure
have a garden run tonight. and won't be on after tomorrow night.
Haven't done crown yet so I'd be interested if it was happening tomorrow evening.  On a side note got my heavy bow.
yeah the leviathan's breath quest is nothing
@Destiny [PC] anyone down for crown we need 1 or 6th had to go
cant find anyone in lfg
ill join
YES save us
very sorry guys. just not feeling well at all suddenly. try and find a 6th tho want yall to get the clear and divinity!
get well soon goal!
thanks. i think it's just exhaustion catching up to me and have a cold so. comes in waves.
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) @RonInDune you available for the final encounter of gos?
either of you?
still need one @Arixama
yeah go for it
I'll be a while
"Guys, if you can, finish the ""Last Days on Kraken Mare"" lore book"
It's among the the best lore pieces Bungie has ever produced
we got the divinity
but at what cost
A price well paid I assume
"Just call me the "" Broken Mind"""
"My first run, where I also got Divinity, was 11 and a half hours"
"Honestly, I think the Sanctified Mind killed itself in our run.  He had no more floors to take or fucks to give and decided that since he couldn’t kill us, the only logical decision was seppuku."
congrats you guys!!!!!
I swear he triggered the tethers by himself
LOOL
It’s the only explanation
he hit the boxes
it was weird
Lmao he did
"Well done anyway, it's a tough raid!"
"Like he fired a few shots at the boxes, fired at me, fired and Rugged, and fired at the boxes again"
"seriously big congrats, it is indeed a tough raid"
If anyone wants a First week jacket code lemme know
the garden final boss is definitely one of the harder raid bosses out there
"there are a lot of mechanics going on, and he is a **big boi**"
very chonky
Ty @Trissin I won’t soon forget that experience
I thought the first three encounters were a bit wild the first time in there... I was not prepared
"hahaha, if you got through garden"
you shouldn't have a problem with the other raids
I hear talk of one with a ribbon that’s going to make me feel all warm and tingly
"But yeah, I’ve never raided in FPS and that was intense and fun, still sorting through all the other emotions that came with it"
"Gnite everyone, thanks to all of you and, thanks for being supportive and awesome 🙂"
"Last wish, the raid bosses name is riven 🤣 I totally can understand how you heard ribbon though especially after all the tethering"
"^
this cleared a lot up. was running through the raids in my head trying to think of ribbons lol"
some of the old raid bosses can still feel pretty chonky because of the lunafaction/rally nerf
"that's true, yeah
val ca'uor comes to mind"
well I'm glad yall got divinity. sorry again for having to dip so suddenly...still getting over this cold.
but i do have a boss checkpoint if anyone would like to get an extra clear tonight @Destiny [PC]
if not I'll just be grinding strikes.
I'm down. I got to flex on that boss and make up for *the years of therapy he's caused me*
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tonight
"I wouldn't mind running the whole thing soon, need like 4 drops to get to 951"
yeah i just want to get the clear tonight if possible. not a huge deal if i don't I'll just run strikes instead. but maybe Sunday i can get a full run for another character.
"@Arixama lmao, I totally imagined it was some kind of buff that looked like a ribbon that swirled around you and likely had to be cycled around the fire team to access different areas or take down elites. The Blueberry abides 😂"
ok this festival of the lost set does look pretty cool
and the best sparrow
idk how i feel about that armor lol.
How could you suggest there exists a sparrow superior to the scooty puff
It's terrible but amazingly terrible
Like watching The Room or something
i'm debating whether i want to grind strikes or randys tonight actually. that medals % is bugging me😬
"I stumbled across a short article about Randy’s and progress, don’t know if this is common knowledge now but here it is and it may help:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/21/heres-why-your-destiny-2-randys-throwing-knife-quest-is-taking-so-long/amp/"
I'll have to give that a read but yeah the quest is just way improperly balanced. i want to get my scout kills finished before i just focus on the medals.
TLDR he says doing rumble and rumble only and seeking cold fusion medals is making medals progress much faster
that's what I'll have to do once scout kills are finished. also need to finish out the glory points but I'm at 1650 so that won't be bad. I'd imagine rumble still has a fair amount of afkers ?
"i havent touched scouts much yet, and im done with the medals, i just ran 2 SMG peacekeepers and shredded people for the SMG medal"
"i think im at 8% on scout kills, maybe 9%"
"I'm at 80% on scout kills i get like, 3-6% per game so it's inconsistent but at least you're always making progress lol."
the medals is just ridiculous. make it all medals or specify which medals grant progress.
"yeah, i think ive done about 2-3 games focusing on scouts. i have a decent rolled gambit scout thats making it pretty easy"
i just went back to year 1 and using MIDA :derp:
still works haha.
Mida is still real good.
9/10 fights where someone is trying to peek I'll win.
jade rabbit is king don't @ me
i dont like how slow firing the rabbit is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
it feels too clunky to me.
i like to *zoom*
^ 100 mobility or go home :wetLUL:
yeah...think I'll go with randys grinding tonight haha. I'm almost done with the bosses and points for the vanguard emblem. at 16% on super/arc kills so that'll be a small grind but not too bad at all.
"if you have a titan, just run shoulder charge + skullfort makes those arc kills super fast"
yeah arcstrider was good too. one super got me 4% one strike. I'll definitely just end up farming those kills out on my titan that's what i did with the void ones.
oh so just checked Braytech...its 900 arc or super kills so no wonder arcstrider is so good haha.
Jade Rabbit is boss
Stable as all hell
"nah, black tiger/scorpion is the way to go"
i had black tiger as my alt scout haha. works real nice.
the fast fire also made it decent enough that i would get close range hip fire kills with it haha.
I used the curated Vouchsafe for a bit and it was absolutely terrible
ouch lol.
there are some weapons i just questions why they exist.
that's one of them.
"I sometimes spend half the game using a scout (usually Talons of the Eagle), get extremely mad at my shite performance, pull out Blast Furnace/Jotunn and finally have fun"
The only reason why I like jade rabbit and the night watch scout rifle is cause they have insane aim assist
of all the scouts in the game those are the only few with noticeable bend
those are the scouts with aim assist > 70
i honestly just got really good with MIDA bc of that year 1 meta. so I just feel so comfortable with it and it handles really well so i can still play fast with it.
yeah MIDA is one of those guns that feels perfect to use
So tight
"One of the best designed guns in the game, imo"
for real. it's very good. it just feels so good to hit those headshots...people drop so fast haha.
It's the one gun that feels similar to the DMR from Halo
midas got an aim assist of 100 as well
One day I will get that catalyst
just gotta hit 5500 glory
"i like how well it handles overall i think. the mobility boost and radar staying up makes it pretty busted, which is why you'll win so many peeking battles."
Do you run the MIDA smg as well?
sometimes. i usually forget about it bc of recluse tho haha.
"tru, I've never consistently run that SMG and don't really remember if it's any good"
it's actually pretty decent.
"recoil is at 80 and recluse is 100, so that's where you'll feel the big difference. but it handles pretty well."
"I ran that combo early on and it’s still one of my favs, the mini tool feels weak though; like not enough punch. Maybe I’ve gotten used my riskrunner crutch too often (now recluse too lol)"
yeah it's definitely outclassed by the other secondary smgs. i actually used the Calus Mini tool for a bit and might actually try for a good roll on it haha. it was pretty fun to use.
Do the Calus weapons give the right buff now? For both Drang and mini tool?
Calus really is our kindly old space Santa
"anyone want to lose their sanity in crucible with me in like, 15 mins?"
also @RonInDune @Buttkikker we have 4 in the raid cp for sure so if you guys wanna get a boss clear in tonight then that would make a full group aha.
I should be able to
"Sure why not, what was the time again"
theres a slight chance ill be busy but i doubt it
Buttkikker fucking loves this boss
8:30 est @RonInDune so like about 3.5 hours from now.
ah that seems fine-ish
cool. if we have to start a bit later like 9 or something that's fine too it's just the cp won't take long.
"""wont take long"""
god i wish
that boss is traumatizing
"In my two clears,  one took ~ 8 hours cause I was 20 light below, but my 2nd went right first try I think"
It's just very glitchy
its fun when it works
when
lol. yeah the bugginess of it can get frustrating but we all know what's going on so hopefully we don't get the short end of the stick.
the short end of the worlds shortest stick
maybe a little salty...
someone please join me at least in voice chat i cannot play this trash mode that is pvp
i am just doing the arms dealer strike then i will be good for raid.
im just doing a nightfall and ill be good
"***""Revoker."" -Goal***"
"***""Leviathan's Breast."" - Goal***"
"@Crizum would love to make it a divinity run if possible. not sure if @Donpablo would need it, but I still need to grab that. hopefully get some missing armor pieces."
"The puzzles aren’t too bad, so I don’t see why we couldn’t"
Sounds good to me
fam i was thinking today.
imagine not using Revoker during the sanctified mind encounter.
can't.
if you know you know:travelergoogly:
By the end of the season @Buttkikker will truly be the most broken person
the end?
already am
between randy's and the sanctified mind i'm dying
randys will break me eventually.
I’m actually 1% away from Randy’s but I was too tired to finish last night had early morning lectures
i cranked out the last bit of glory i needed and went up to 34% on medals so now i can fuck around with jotunn.
I only played rumble for medals just camped with a fusion for the cold fusion medals
And camped heavy hard with 1k
are there still afkers in rumble? or do people actually try.
Not really
Everything is sweaty af
I had 3 quickplay games that were 150-149 2 days ago
bleh.
@link270 and I also want to do a divinity run soon. Still need to do the prereqs though
For the first time in like 4 weeks i'm not drowning in work and assignments
Is there a garden run going on tonight?
If there's space i'll join up
only one planned for sunday is full.
if not its cool
but there could be one for tonight
id be down
Do I hear flawless run?
oh i aint good enough for flawless just yet
i need to be sherpa'd through garden tbh
i dont even know the meta
revoker
YA
QUOTE ME AGAIN
you forgot must have Revoker.
ah shit
i dont have revoker
i gotta remove myself now
oh shit. exposed.
"@Trissin meta would be MT or Izanagi for first two encounters, just izanagi for third and fourth, recluse with anti-barrier rounds and Wendigo/Swarm/Love and Death spike launchers in the heavy slot, you could substitute 21% delirium in the heavy a lot for he first two encounters"
"Or, you could be goal and run Revoker/Darci"
if you're not a pussy you use Revoker and Darci
If you don’t have revoker run any primary sniper with mulligan
that too.
Mulligan and outlaw
Nah meta is bottom tree void hunter with bows in every slot
Really rock the Tomb raider cosplay
Infinite cyclops is what they call that
izanagi who ?? never heard of her.
"Hey Izanagi is Ada-1's favourite weapon, don't be dissing her"
By favourite I mean the gun she used to kill her mother
"“Man that’s a sad ass backstory, you mind if I use this thing to chunk the Vex?”"
"“Thank you, Guardian, for proving me wrong” *Guardian proceeds to honed edge a Dreg and dab on it*"
I just ran into the weirdest fucking hacking
i've ever seen
in crucible
I wonder if it was the same dude we saw
this guy was teleporting everywhere and he would instantly respawn exactly where he died
YEAH I CLIPPED THAT GUY
"oh, I meant like strats wise"
wtf?
weapons are pretty clear lmao
Oh. Strats are ez pz
Yeah I saw a guy in Rumble who'd respawn instantly after death with overshield
when i get back on sunday I'll have to post those clips this guy was insane it was laughable.
I though it was a bug
the first time
I honestly thought he was lagging
then i realized he kept teleporting on people
so odd
I need to be off by 10ish est but if we are starting at 7:30 est I can run it with you guys if you need someone
like look at the match results lma
"Yeah we had that too, the match began and he was at our spawn"
yo @Matos
join us
ill join you brothers
i just need to get caught up on the divinity quest
but i've cleared the raid
ayy nice yea join us
we out here
@Peronix coming out of blue portal seeing the red floor like https://m.imgur.com/gallery/AQFRS2M
"Can't trust nobody, not even the *F L O O R*"
By the way TWAB has been out for a bit and I really like the winners of the fashion contest
My personal faves are Danni's Warlock and TadsJr's Titan
"@Destiny [PC] Bungie confirmed you have until the end of the season to get the title Undying, can’t finish out collections at a later date"
what title
undying?
yeah and any seasonal titles this year i would assume applies as well.
"so, i just need to crank out those medals next week and then do a master nightfall for the ship."
then it's just the undying mind kills.
Getting to 960+ helps out a lot on master
Can’t even do the mind kills until the 19th of November so you have some time
And as much as you don’t want Izanagi’s running one or two of those with divinity makes the master nightfalls so much easier
Slightly disappointed that all the fashion week winners are all character menu screenshots.
Maybe bungie reached out to the players to get character menu screenshots
"And they've fixed the Izanagi bugs, now just grind bounties"
@Crizum i'm still on the watcher lens part of that so I'm not gonna waste my time doing old stuff for something i don't even need.
enough people have it anyway.
Yeah just run Divinity
"But like weapons are as much a part of fashion as the rest of the pieces, and the character menu only displays primary weapons"
"and I'm not saying its not doable, just that its so much easier haha"
i think a master nightfall also depends which strike it is. even with the champions and stuff some are easier to handle than others. it's just a matter of getting randys done first for me.
"This week is savathuns song I think, so rip"
wasn't planning on doing it this week anyway lmao.
Yeah I think savathun song is trash for it
inverted spire is probably the best one for it
Savathun's is really good for getting a 100K though
Yeah I agree with Crizum. Either that or Lake of Shadows
"or the one with Xol, that one isn't terrible"
yeah I'd say any strike where you can really burn down the boss is fine. but those that damage gate you constantly can get rough.
@Destiny [PC] Any others for garden starting in ~ 10 - 15 min?
I’m on
So if Peronix is down we have a full run
I can join but I've never done it before
@Rye go for it!
don't know if they want specifically people who know the mechanics
"It should be okay, I'm learning as well lol"
neat
It's a fairly good raid to learn
Oof I just went out 😂 I'd join otherwise
Yeah I can explain
Nothing can possibly go wrong
from what I've been told its like gambit but as a raid
at least some part of it
We'll explain that portion when we get there
"It sounds complicated and confusing, but is pretty simple really"
"give me like 6 or 7 minutes, ill be on"
"'Nothing can possibly go wrong'
***tethers intensifies***"
Sent some friend requests so we can link up in orbit
@thegoaliebear or @Arixama can you pin this I think it’s solid advice for garden of salvations final encounter
im booting up destiny now ill be in voice chat in like 5 mins
I’m mad lol
Just one shot sanctified mind after ricochet rounds started it before we were done explaining it haha
I'm very happy for y'all!
ez first try
yeah i accidently pulled wiht ricochet rounds and we did it
ez
If there's another one planned soon I'll try to join in
@Rye hopefully it wasn’t too confusing haha
it was ez
hardest part was the stupid tethers tbh
especially that hourglass one
The only encounter we didn’t one shot was the first lol
https://clips.twitch.tv/JazzyCourageousPoxPartyTime
heres your possessed bird
its so weird not in person lol
watching it again still makes me laugh
oh btw
i shot at @rozak and it bounces from the ground between his legs and hit the boss
https://clips.twitch.tv/RamshackleMoralHummingbirdUnSane
Calculated pull
https://clips.twitch.tv/LittleRepleteIcecreamCurseLit
one stray shot
starts the boss
EZ CLEAR ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CLICK THE BOSS ON THE HEAD
alright i just need randy's and undying mind
"protip, corrupted is a regular nightfall this week so you can just go into blind well and farm out ability kills using harmony"
ooooh ty
particularly helpful for the arc step since arc supers are super effective  for progressing it
ik there's a raid sunday night but for anyone who needs randy's progress as well or just wants to help me fight off losing my sanity... @Destiny [PC]
i know its so late and no one wants to think of the place lol but can i get a few people to help me through the shattered throne to get an izanagis burden and wish ender? @Destiny [PC]
"I need Wish ender as well, so i'm down"
awesome! i'll make a post and @ you when i get it up! im thinking around 6 or 7ET that way you can still loose your sanity at 8 lolo
that's not until sunday.
"Yea, I'm free anytime today, man!"
don't believe anything else is going on tonight anyway tho.
"oh damn, didnt see that. ok then 7 ET work?"
"Yea, that's cool"
Bot displays the localized date incorrectly on mobile at the bottom 🤣
that explains it lol
yeah it's annoying haha.
"Xûr's selling Geomags and Liars Handshake, both really important exotics. Get em if you need em"
"Also Synthoceps, but I think you get that from the campaign?"
Not anymore I don’t think
"My first response was ""what rolls?"" Lol"
You could get them before new light but I think they removed them
Synthoceos from campaign? No
Doom Fangs
was it that part where you chose between 3
i remember ac/dc feedback was there
I believe the last was Actium?
"no synthoceps, I'm p sure"
"Just looked it up, it was actium/feedback fence/doom fang"
I knew doomfang was on there
Regardless I don’t think they give them out anymore?
"That's what I heard as well, but I haven't played thru it to confirm"
Saw on reddit they don’t drop from campaign anymore
What about the weapons from Asher?
I guess those would be gone too?
I don’t think any red war quests have those anymore
kinda sucks
Nightfalls drop exotics like candy though so it balances
especially seeing as new players need so many exotics to catch up
I'm not sure I like that
Exotics _should_ be rare
And I think new players need at least some compensation for the campaign lol
Compensation is they don’t have to play it lol
"@Crizum Yeah even on lower difficulties as well, I've gotten one exotic each week from the level 2 ordeal"
"Ordeal is the endgame content that isn’t raids, it’s more for farming a good roll on armor exotics since collections come in lower"
and because of the different elemental affinities
you need some way to farm armor
but i dont believe weapons drop
Yeah the only thing missing is like a quest where you can get a specific exotic
I feel like the odds right now on exotic armor is a bit too low
"There’s a good mix of quested/random drops, and once you hit cap I think primes have a pretty good chance of being an exotic"
Plus Xur has the knockout system on his engrams
Yeah but  if you want for example acitum war  rig with a different elemental property then the chaces are pretty low
See I don’t understand why they didn’t at least curate collections for exotics that interact with weapons lol
What use is war rig with pulse affinity?
its arc affinity if i remember
which works with machineguns but not auto rifles
Smooth Bungie
"Hey, anyone feel like trying out some of the master nightmare hunts? Wanna try for the time trials"
"I’ll be around this afternoon, if we could find one more to give it some attempts. I know it’s 10 minutes for Fanatic and Phogoth and 15 for Crota"
I'm down to face my master nightmares as well
"damn, aren't those 980?"
good luck yall
"Yea, it'll be rough. You could say they're a...*nightmare*"
_Petition to remove Peronix from the clan_
"wait hold on, if master is 980"
what is legend
960
lol imagine a 1k nightmare hunt
Next season haha
But I know it’ll be rough. Shield breaking weapons for sure and the group I saw was two tethers and a Phoenix protocol well
Izanagi and divinity for sure
@Peronix im jumping on whenever youre ready!
and if anyone else needs a shattered throne run we have space for one more
i want to do more old raids
the only raid i have yet to do it scourge of the past
i would love to run some scourge
id definitely run some of that
who ever gets afks in rumble is lucky
this game went to the last few seconds
Does anyone know if black garden kills (like offensive) count toward moon kills for the void class triumph
"They do, so do kills on garden of salvation"
Fan damn tastic lol thank you
just had a dude in another server try to say the ikelos smg was better than recluse.
um.
uhhh...ya
I have concerns.
^ my reaction.
well it certainly looks better!
"and sounds a bit better too, but that's subjective"
haha that's all it really has going for it.
The Warmind aesthetic was amazing
"but this is one of those guys who's always like ""it's all a matter of opinion"" and I'm like yeah sometimes but in this case there are guns that are just objectively better than others😂"
"Armour, gun design, architecture, everything was very unique"
Oh yeah I fully agree with you there lol
There is nothing better than Recluse atm
If it were a matter of opinion we wouldn’t have things considered god rolls right?
anyone gotten exit strategy yet?
yeah.
how was the grind?
working on it now
finished randys yesterday
it's not bad at all. a breeze compared to Randy's.
yea randys was awful
the smg multikills you'll probs have done in 2-3 matches. the points earned takes the longest but i got it done in a couple nights just dedicated to gambit.
regular gambit is probably better just since you have two rounds to send blockers and kill stuff.
whats the best for medals?
regular?
yeah either will work for those pretty consistent too with progress.
i got mine done in two nights of just gambit. goes much faster than the others aha.
randys is so damn good
like one of my fav guns in the game
@thegoaliebear wait isnt the ikelos smg a 750rpm?
so i guess there is SOME merit in that guys claim
but recluse is still recluse
cant beat it
@Destiny [PC] anyone wanna do scourge tonight
"Buttkikker and I are playing some gambit, he has divinity and I have taken spec on my weapons. I am running tether with 100 intellect and bad juju. I feel bad for our enemies."
jesus
"because bad juju aint enough, 100 intellect"
"Don't know what the hell happened but in shattered throne i was suddenly revived and the message "">revived Nahkriin"" came up."
Were you solo??
"No, buttkikker was with me but he didnt know what happened either. I think it was a bug, Ive never seen anything like it though"
I think that happens when a darkness zone no longer becomes a darkness zone
like a boss is defeated or something
I know I've seen it before as well but I can't remember where atm
"I've also seen it in PvP I think, for certain game modes"
^ strike pending but would love to get the master NF out of the way tuesday night. @Destiny [PC]
"Sorry for missing Shattered Throne last night, @the_drake1997. Ended up passing out for the night after work. If you need to still need to do the dungeon, I'll make sure I won't pass out before doing it😂"
You're good lol I've been there! I'll see if I have anything else going on this weekend and I'll post it up on here again!
@Peronix so i basically have the rest of today free if you want to jump on whenever and do the dungeon?
"Im down to do it rn, sure"
im actually gonna eat real quick and i'll be on
"Hey @Peronix sorry, you still on?"
"Yep, in the Alpha FT channel"
@Destiny [PC] Anyone wanna do 950 ordeal? need one
"Of all the new maps, Twilight Gap is my least favourite"
I just understand what loadout works best and the map just feels too crowded
"Too many weird boxes and stuff, too many broken sightlines"
"I though this was one of the best D1 maps, did they change anything?"
The entire sandbox around the map
@Destiny [PC] anybody feel like attempting master level nightmare hunts?
Barring that I could go for a nightfall if you still need one @Chance
we already did it : (
No worries haha
what the heck there are people at Season Rank 600 already
if you grind all the dailys and weeklys on all chars in a day its worth like 2mil xp i think
so that would help
either way really impressive
looked them up on raid report and they've already flawlessed GoS
TBH flawless garden is not nearly as difficult as you may think
I know quite a few who have done it as well
"Especially with the relay bug right now, they pretty much all agree the relay bug makes it a cakewalk"
good to know
What's the relay bug? The enhanced realy defender one?
"If you want to get flawless garden, best do it before that gets patched"
where you swap armor and move around
Do you still get stuff after season rank 100?
Yeah you get Tess's engrms every 5 or so levels I think
"Also, Gothalion switched to Mixer"
Wasn't he the biggest Destiny 2 streamer?
i never followed him much.
really only watch Broman or Datto for D2 stuff.
"Me neither, I didn't like how forced everything in his stream felt.  Broman just discussed the move so I knew about it. Wonder if they're moving as well"
@RonInDune I din't get that impression at all. I like his content.
I watch broman too btw
broman isn't moving haha. that's all his stream rn is.
lots of disruption everywhere
i mean... i don't think it's enough for mixer. if anything it makes more room on twitch for others to grow.
Competition is good
Like Twitch basically had streaming monopoly for the last 7 years?
"they still do. mixer is nowhere close. but big names moving over definitely help them, but they really only bring over so many viewers."
i think it's easy for big name streamers to move since they'll have their viewers no matter what. but for growing streamers twitch is still probably better.
Especially with the vacuum it makes by the big stars leaving
DIdn't Ninja lose a good portion of viewers after moving to Mixer as well?
Yeah for sure
yeah his streams get like 10-15k viewers now. which is still a ton but he easily got like 30k most of the time on average.
"Just looked up the relay defender bug, well who wants to give it a try >_>"
We are using bugs now?
"For flawless? Sure, it’s how streamers are low manning it and how others are getting flawless. For normal or teaching runs? No."
"@Crizum I was joking, How does the bug work? 😏"
"Haha, looks like you just swap around relay defender and advanced relay defender mods before the start of the third encounter"
I dont see how that's a bug tho
Anyone interested in doing some survival crucible?
Trying to unlock recluse
They shouldn’t be stacking
@Kronohs If your goal is to get recluse then solo queue is the best options. It suxs playing alone but the matchmaking is way better.
Oh ok. Yeah it sucks playing alone. On heroic iii but having a hard time getting wins now for some reason
The key to glory rank below fabled is consistency and making less mistakes
That's literally true for every rank though.
"As your rank increases, consistency goes up and mistakes go down. Simple as that."
"Just before Fabled is kinda harsh, lots of people going super sweaty"
For sure but it gets more important with mechanics on higher glory
I'm well aware of mechanical importance
Idk I keep being told mechanical skill isn’t important just run a one eyed striker
I mean if you miss all your shots then OEM won't help you 😔
Also snipers can two shot body shot strikers now
so that's a small relief
arcstriders are still impossible to hit though
"Arcstrider most busted pvp class, just has more people playing it so it isn’t a problem"
just run from an Arcstaff
needs to be popped right on top of you for a guaranteed kill
otherwise you outrun it
"don't get me wrong, it's got that armor on the pop so you have to get the kill before the animation starts or the animation ends, but otherwise it's not the most busted lol"
"Dawnblade, bottom tree striker are both more busted right now, not by a lot but by enough"
and they're being nerfed so
"yeah, but is dawnblade neutral as good?"
"You can kill dawnblade and striker, bottom tree arc has “you are harder to kill when dodging” and “increases maximum sprint speed, recharged your dodge” built in"
@Crizum isn dodge busted with arc battery?
"In that you can tank literally anything? Yes, but I’m avoiding the seasonal artifact since that will go away"
yeah it basically give you a boost in everything
also I need to try the magnetic grenade + opressive darkness combo
didnt work for me
Hunters just get all up in their feelings if they aren’t the best at everything in the game
"“I don’t get to be the best pvp class, the best group add clear, the best single target dps? NERF THEM ALL”"
uh? no? maybe some people with horrible egos but idgaf if hunters are the best
@Buttkikker there is some rng involved I heard
I guess it’s just tiring reading arguments of wormhusk vs OEM without people acknowledging the wildly different scenarios those things involved
"one existed for two months with no counterplay, the other has existed for a year with the ""counterplay"" of don't shoot the guy aka don't play the game lol."
@Crizum I have no problem as a titan main that they nerf btstriker and oem but it's just that the rest of the titan subclasses are mediocre in pvp
I mean didn’t you just say “run away from arcstrider” as a counter lol
to the super?
not to wormhusk?
"Just burn the OEM ape down, it’s not instant health and shields for the most part"
"okay so you're saying because running from super is counterplay to arcstrider right now, wormhusk is more busted than oem....?"
Or was more busted than oem ever was?
"Oh I know it's not instant health and shields but you have the choice of shooting the titan and loosing, instantly making him more tanky than anyone else, or having your blueberries doing that and now you effectively have to 1v1.5 someone"
I’m not trying to say OEM isn’t busted but I’m lacking caffeine
"Idk, it’s busted but they aren’t invincible by any means, and we can’t count on blueberries for much"
It's also free info so you can't peek a titan using it
wallhacks hp buff and a damage buff is way too much
Just saying the meta wormhusk existed isn’t the one OEM exists in
And it’s getting a nerf anyway
"I'm aware they aren't invincible, but I don't like the comparison that OEM is not as bad as Wormhusk was, when the one has existed for a year with fairly minor changes and the other existed for two months at most"
"They said they're looking into making some changes, whether that's a nerf or not we'll see"
It’s a badly designed band-aid exotic to help a poorly optimized class that has only become an issue once they buffed arc subclasses
What? OEM or Wormhusk?
"But it has only become a major source of consternation after arc week, ain’t nobody complaining about hammer of sol one eyes"
OEM
people have been complaining about OEM since october of last year
But it has blown up majorly since arc week right?
"no? It's blown up since January-ish where more and more Titans had it. It was sold for the first time back in late March or early April, which was before Arc week."
"Do Titans need some better neutral games in their other trees? Absolutely, but the issue of OEM has been present since it's introduction."
"My bad on that one I guess, I just assumed since the meme was “OEM striker lul” it was an arc week inspired issue"
I do feel like people will complain about literally anything titans and warlocks get though
because the vocal minority is salty hunter mains
People will just complain. Period.
Every class has salty x mains though.
Fair enough and I’ll admit I’m a salty Titan main
Arent we all.....
only when im bad
"OEM can go away and get nerfed, but I don’t want to hear complaints about like our “no skill one hit melees” etc"
Thundercoil. That's all I will say.
Okay but arc battery
Like I said not complaining about seasonal artifacts unless they stay throughout the seasons
"Yeah, which is a fair counterpoint, not disagreeing, both are dumb lol."
If they bring them both back yes lol
"Also the shoulder charges are literally full commits so just shoot him before he gets to you? Oh, and position better. People who bitch about that just don't know where to go in PvP I feel."
Seeing that even with OEM only striker Titan hits top 5 for win percentage with like dawnblade being the only warlock subclass was interesting
Could have been console only on that one though
I would just hope if they adjust striker further and end up sending OEM to the dirt they don’t leave striker in the ground again
"The striker changes are fine IMO. OEM just needs to remove tracking and it'd be better. as it stands, if you shoot an OEM Titan and you have to go into cover, you cannot peek again without them knowing exactly when you're gonna peek."
maybe instead give the better radar for a few seconds or somthing
Make it twilight garrison
I don't think it still needs 3 things rolled into one
i totaly agree but if they do intend on keeping that then some changes would be nice
"@here not feeling the raid today, can give up my spot to someone who has yet to complete - going to be tackling other quests and triumphs I need to catch up on"
good luck to those in it!
striker titan is whatever i can live with it. but i feel OEM is just a crutch for a lot of average players.
the arcstrider combo nowadays is just as annoying. don't think shit like that has any real place in pvp but oh well.
"OEM starts to get real scary though when good players are using it and activating it on weaker teammates so whenever you run into them, they've got the overshield."
"yeahhh...i just don't like it haha. that's also why pvp doesn't have any longevity tbh. exotics like that, if you're a new player and all you're running into are titan's with OEM...you're not gonna play pvp again after you get your quests done."
or until you get OEM yourself and maybe decide you wanna be part of the meta lol. but that's not very likely.
I finally have revoker
That's 6 hours of my life I'll never get back
"I am having some computer problems, If they are not fixed by raid time, feel free to lfg."
We trying to do a Garden of Salvation later?
"In about 50 minutes, still have two spots"
"First time run for a friend of mine, maybe two friends depending"
I can maybe get in on that if you need me. Would be first run for me.
Yeah of course
"yeah like I said, might be able to."
@RonInDune now you can use it in GoS with me 👀
anyone want to 950 nightfall?
good luck guys
My PC problems should be fixed but I might be on a few minutes late
@Oathbreaker what’s the verdict?
need to eat and am finishing up some things
If you guys desperately need me I would need some time
About how much would you say?
"Nvm looks full, next time~"
yeah sorry bunch of stuff popped up all at once
@here we need one more for final encounter of garden
if anyone else wants to join feel free. will just be pvp tonight i'll need help keeping my sanity.
also still getting over this cold so sorry i sound like a boy going through puberty/someone who smokes 3 packs a day. take your pick.
what if its both
that's acceptable too.
Pretend it's your Halloween voice
You're cosplaying Axl Rose or Kurt CObain
if we have 4 is comp acceptable?
i think its less cancerous than quickplay
comp is just 3v3 haha.
oh nvm
i don't mind QP now that i'm done with scout kills i can fuck around with jotunn.
gotcha sounds good
"My router just shit the bed, so I'm going to go ahead and call it a night. Good luck on Randys!"
aww no worries thanks for playing with us!
"first thing i did after setting foot on the moon (and completing the intro mission) was go say hi to phogoth. got there flawlessly and purely on memory, but the door was shut :("
I GOT TO FIGHT PHOGOTH
and the cheeze spot still works!!
^ I'm at 67% for medals. positive i can finish it tonight. if anyone else needs Randy's progress or just wants to fuck around in pvp feel free to join tonight!
"ill join, may be a bit late depending on what work wants"
yeah no worries. i might be on a bit earlier anyways just gonna be chillin - if that word can ever apply to pvp lol.
i also got clips of those cheaters last night.
https://clips.twitch.tv/LuckyAggressiveLardNerfRedBlaster
https://clips.twitch.tv/BitterArborealTigerChefFrank
can literally see the guy walk out of the tree and then the other guys aim snap right on for the headshots.
"Change of plans, going to Halloween store after work so I won’t be available at 7:45"
"Out of all the games to hack in, imagine hacking in *Crucible*"
hahaha deadass tho.
it was so obvious too since we shit on them the first couple rounds.
and then suddenly they're only hitting headshots and can hide in the map😂
@Destiny [PC]  if there's anybody who doesn't have forsaken it's 40% off on steam right now!
I just bought it last week 🤦🏾‍♂️
@Papa_Palpatine. sometimes if you send them a really nice email they will refund the difference if it’s within a few days!
im so incredibly mad perfect besides spike and masterwork :(
Is gambit the best way to farm kills for that?
i just launch a solo nightfall with 3 nade launchers
old school nightfall btw
If Mayhem is up that’s probably the fastest
How long did it take you to get 100 kills? Or do powerful enemy's cou t for more too?
not long there's 20 enemies before you even go into the infinite forest in a garden world
its like 10-15 min for the 100 kills
if even
fighting lion is definitely helpful if you have it
you can just queue into a strike or nightfall with just the fighting lion and get the kills in like 10 minutes
"See I'm thinking whisper with taken armaments might be good, but I don't know timing wise if it's worth it"
my best roll rn is hard launch spike field prep kill clip and reload masterwork
whisper is in a pretty nice spot currently with the removal of auto reloads
and now you can easily chose sniper reserves or ammo finder
btw is anyone interested in a 980 nightmary hunt before reset tomorrow?
Want those time trials for Harbinger haha
you know what would be awesome
if you could accumulate perk rolls you obtain and store them in your collection so you can pull a roll out with perks you've gotten
wouldnt that just make so much sense
specific rolls or perks per gun?
Like armor 2.0 for guns?
if you could customize it would be insane
They tried that in d1
but rolls youve gotten sure
rolls you've gotten imo
"but if you could pull out your ideal roll, assuming you've gotten all those rolls"
but also a double edged sword
because eventually everyone would have the god roll
which is good and bad
it would just be nice if there was some kind of bad luck protection
removes the grinding (which is good and bad depending on who you ask)
"Something like “I’ve gotten ricochet rounds on this smg, I can pull it from collections with ricochet rounds”?"
love having a slight disadvantage because someone is luckier than me
@Crizum yes or like if you accidently dismantle a good roll and you want it back type of thing
but then it turns into paying for vault space
"Or something like, you got outlaw on one roll and kill clip on another you could select an outlaw/kill clip roll? Dunno if they’d ever want that"
there would still be grinding to do but it would be much more feasible to get the ideal roll
but maybe you HAVE to dismantle those rolls to 'unlock' the perks
"If they really wanted to make it a thing, make it a lower chance on dismantle"
"Either that, or consumables that let you re-roll specific perk slots?"
They did something like that in D1. People stopped grinding and just rerolled for the best in slot gear for PvP and PvE. Made things really boring.
"Double edge sword, makes it easier for people that don’t hardcore grind for rolls to get what they want, but at the cost of the long-term retention. I think it’s what lead to D2 vanilla"
Menagerie was the best way to handle it. You could go for what you wanted and decide the masterwork while still having to fight some rng
yeah i wish there where more options tho
"We're definitely going to see more stuff like menagerie going forward. Since shadowkeep and were already deep in development when opulence came out, they had no idea how people were going to react to the chalice."
and the nightmare essences are amazing
theyre grindable but not too much and they have amazing weapons
@Crizum a menagerie loot rotation would also make a lot of sense
rotates the guns out for something else
put like retold tale and other shotguns on there
and stuff like that
once a month or something?
yeah that would be awesome
lol i can spell
Maybe I'm just cruel but I don't want good drops to come easily
God rolls and exotics should be really rare / difficult to obtain
I think that rarity is what makes it more exciting when you actually get a god roll or an exotic
Yeah but it’s also ass to need them to be competitive in PvP
Hmmmmm
which is why I never care about pvp lol.
Maybe I don't play enough PvP but I don't think there's anything you **need** to perform well
and that's also why players just turn away from pvp.
"Maybe a good roll gives a slight edge, yeah"
But nothing that you can't even challenge without the right weapon perks
oh you can definitely be successful with non meta or god roll weapons. if you're good then you're good.
That's my opinion
"I think Redrix was one of their best PvP weapons, excellent in the right hands, merely quite good with scrubs"
Yeah but exotics and the hypothetical is what I mean
"And I also think it's not hard to get a good roll on something, it just won't be perfect"
Reclus etc. broke that balance
but with everyone running around with shotguns that hit from sniper range and OEM...new players to the game are so easily discouraged from playing the mode.
"If exotics were super duper rare it feels unfair to be killed by them, if they aren’t rare enough they can feel whatever"
"Yeah I tried to introduce a friend to the game, he ran around the crucible for a couple of hours and quite disliked it"
yeah the thing is that pve will always be the core of the game.
"You make a good point. Exotics could be considered a problem in that light, yeah"
i see so many people ask for trading in this game but imo it would ruin such a huge part of the grind especially with getting god rolls or like 1K and anarchy
"As someone with apparently better than average rng it took me like 5 clears for 1k voices, how many did it take goal just for a title?"
39
"Now imagine it isn’t a title, it’s a meta crucible weapon"
1k took you 39 runs?
39 on a weekly lockout lol
I think I got my title on my 27th
ya
1st try 🙂
i nearly quit the game bc of that rng bullshit.
Got 1k before the glittering key
i got my glittering key and had no idea what it was
they finally learned their lesson.
rng items have no place in titles.
i much rather prefer the exotic quests for raid exotics
100%
like outbreak prime and touch of malice
Fully agreed
I still don't have anarchy and I'm mad
touch of malice was such a good quest since you got all of the books of sorrow grimoire cards doing it and those are amazing
I remember the session where every Criz got anarchy
even tho it was long af
I’m legit only missing tarrabah
"all the inclusion of rng in titles did was create a feeling of resentment for players. rather than seeing someone with Rivensbane and going ""wow that person has real skill and dedication to do all those raid challenges"" people instead think ""ok so they had better rng than i did whatever"""
i actually like tarabah everyone shits on it but when i got it its pretty fun
To be fair they still pulled a petras run so I’ll give them that haha
"and not to say you wouldn't consider Rivensbane a skillful title to earn, but it wouldn't be your first thought if all you needed for the title was 1kv."
i want to try a petras run never even tried it
i did petras run 2 months before i got 1kv.
"the sad thing about that title was that ideally, petras run *should have* been the last thing you attempt for the title. but the rng killed that structure."
very trye
true*
"I guess to the original point. Thorn, Last Word, Ace of Spades are all quested and all competitively viable, but imagine if they were just 1% drops or something"
totally agree.
The salt that would flow when getting tapped by an OEM Ace user would be off the charts
lo
lol*
i wonder how they are going to change oem
Maybe a chance to proc overshield?
"Probably remove wallhacks, or lower the duration"
Like a 1 in 3 chance or something
i think that also has to do with the type of players. more hardcore players like us can deal with it. but to more casual players it's extremely discouraging.
the wall hacks need to go
but i totally want the wall hacks to go.
Naw rng exotics feel bad for a whole different reason lol
Preferably a 1 in 20000 chance for wallhacks on getting hit
still too high a chance
literal wall hacks just...totally take the skill away. you cannot peek them with a chance because they literally know where you are and how you're moving.
If they take away health and leave wallhacks it’s just foetracer at that point
It just makes you play so passive you cant ever challenge
The hunter invis grants true sight too right? With the bug exotic
the overshield and regen is fine tbh i think that's an exotic perk that's...exotic lol.
the wall hacks just make it way too much and a huge crutch for subpar players. which makes it even worse when you have an actual good player using it.
And yeah Ron
Khepri’s sting gives true sight on smoke bomb
the hunter thing annoys me just as much as oem haha.
"And foetracer marks targets and buffs damage on low health targets, no kill required"
"So I don’t think OEM will copy those, health on kill when the target damages you feels like it would reward good gunplay without feeling oppressive"
Would still be deadly in the right hands but wouldn’t make the other person just stop playing
"@Trissin I agree with them being hard to get to a certain point. Its completely RNG based, its not like is the Redrix quest for example that takes a while to get but you're guaranteed to get it"
you could farm for a year for something and never get the roll you want
especially if the perks are flooded with other perks
"lets use love and death as an example: the first trait has 7 different option, the 2nd has 8 the 3rd has 6 and the 4th has 4"
which is actually pretty nice that the 4th one only has 4
but if you want an ideal role that 1/7 x 1/8 x 1/6 x 1/4
thats pretty low dawg
"As someone who plays card games alot I would say what they need to do is to put everything OP in the artifact ( Like card games do set rotations), that way it will go away at the end of the season. If they keep nerfing stuff then it will eventually become bland and boring.."
atleast something like badluck protection would be nice
i see what u mean
perfection is a little too rare
"I guess that's what makes rng and the whole system an issue in itself, right"
if this were easy to solve we wouldn't really have this prblem
i guess I just prefer that very few/none have a god roll rather than everybody have it
if that makes sense
thats .075%
@Trissin I rather lock it behind some super difficult content instead of making it super super rare
"^^
that would be the ideal solution"
but we're not gonna have a whisper/outbreak mission for every pulse with outlaw rampage are we
call me crazy but I really like the model outbreak and whisper set
those really difficult timed missions
i enjoy those a lot
it feels rewarding
not exhausting
@Chance Problem is that that content takes ages to make
unfortunately
If they could they probably have a quest and mission for each exotic
"I think currently the menagerie is the best model we have for regular, non/exotic gear and random rolls"
"By the way, the Golden Joystick game awards voting is gonna close soon, so if anyone wants, vote!"
"ou, ty ron"
https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/goldenjoystickawards/
which is why they should totally reuse the menagerie and add some kind of loot pool rotation
@Trissin I think so too but the feedback from menagerie won't make it into the pipeline until mid spring
Shadowkeep isn't my personal GOTY (or even close) but it's definitely the best live service game right now
"out of curiosity ron, what is your goty then"
Control
i think you have really good taste in games and stuff
With Untitled Goose Game a close second
D2 won't be next years goty for sure...
I'll keep playing no matter what but yeah there's some big hitter next year
it will probably be good tho
It fulfills a different need
as long as there are no more scout final blows
"Outer Worlds is pretty good, not GOTY but I really enjoyed it"
"Don't worry, it'll be 1k sidearm final blows"
"^
can we just talk about sidearms for a sec"
and Death Stranding is gonna come out and be all sorts of gas huffing greatness
why has everyone gotten like 300 god roll smuggler's word
but we can't god roll on other weapons
"I'm prepared for sidearm kills lol, I've been stockpiling godrolls for years"
Can't we just have an expansion with melee weapons
Because there aren't a lot of kinetic things in the world loot
"Season of the King, nothing but reskinned rat kings"
Instant GOTY
"smuggler's word is jsut a specific example, so many god roll sidearms"
"I want spears, clubs and stuff"
"^^^
that would be fun LOL"
Sword and shield
I want big cartoon boxing gloves for my titan
And those ninja star things for my hunter
I mean Warframe has a variety of cool melee weapons
"Warlocks get casting staves, Hunters get huge throwing knives, Titans get to just headbutt everything with a sharp helmet"
Import the Zweihander from Dark Souls
I need the gunblades from monster hunter
insect glaive in destiny 😮
After the melee expansion i would probably make a social expansion and add some new social spaces
Like a gym at the tower where you can work out with shaxx
Or a pub at the bottom of the travler
destiny has been out for less than a month on steam and i have 162 hours in it
I'm supposed to be an adult and yet
lol im not supposes to be an adult so ive an excuse
That's unfair
64 hours in the past 2 weeks for me
unlocked all the achievements in a single day too /s
15 hours for me only
You've escaped the Matrix!
i didnt ask for this
i am going to hop on now actually if anyone wants to join for pvp quickplay.
@Peronix i'll still be on later haha i'm down to do whatever. if i still need to finish up randy's and i need some strikes as well.
if you folks have a spot open I'd love to join in about 10-15
definitely.
"@thegoaliebear got done earlier than expected, still got a space open?"
sure thing @Rye
"was fun, thanks for having me :)"
thanks for joining!
it's done fam.
"Do you guys know who gets the money if I buy a game whose developer has shut down? I wanted to get ECHO, but apparently they've closed shop"
"On a related note, I wish Bungie would release Oni on steam"
The publisher would get it
"Devs usually don’t get very much of it unfortunately, usually publishers get the lions share anyway"
so it was an indie game and self published
"""Ultra Ultra"" was the devs"
"Oh huh, yeah that changes things"
"I'd assume it would go to the retailer, maybe?"
What platform is it being sold on?
Steam
(https://store.steampowered.com/app/551770/ECHO/)
"Could still be whoever was behind Ultra Ultra, or someone could have bought the rights"
Likely would just go to Valve then and whoever holds the rights to the game
hmm hmmmm
Has anyone done a lot of reckoning since shadowkeep? I'm hearing they drop some pretty high stat roll gear
disruption break works on barrier champions??
no it just synergizes well with anti barrier
since the perk works off their barriers
50% debuff
but it applies the 50% damage buff tho
which is insane
yuh
it stacks with other debuffs
not entirely sure about buffs but it works with the void nade perk for sure
which would mean tether or other debuffs
:shock:
like a 130% damage buff for izanagis is actually dumb
@Buttkikker you get your nightmare hunt done?
oh no completely forgot lol
"Lol, off for the night or did you wanna try?"
sure im down
@Destiny [PC] got a third spot if anyone is interested in the master nightmare hunt?
I would join but I'm like 930 lol.
Only a 50 level deficit haha
@Crizum RIP im about to do one but we are 2
unluck
unlucky
i cant find anyone on pc lfg for some reason
you know what we could do
we squad up and do it twice and swap out someone on the second run
yeah that works
hop in discord?
"I’d like to join y’all, 960+ now, if you’re still needing a third.  Servers are down now ofc but if you’re doing another/multiple and want a third, I’m your huckleberry."
"Well, here I was thinking my time zone got screwed up.. I see now that y’all were up late and it was a quiet morning. Hope y’all whooped it’s ass"
!lfg 702
Bungie is mad
This is also so good
"""I wouldn't have to afk in your stupid game if I didn't have to play your stupid game for stupid game rewards!"""
"oh thank god, 20 was so low for consumables. Reaper synths fall from the sky lol"
ty bungie
phantasmal cores are increased from  3 to 999
they didn't fix the relay defender exploit it seems
If I'm understanding the weapons of light adjustment thats actually pretty huge
"nice QOL update, the timer on armor now ties in to how long your bubble is. I guess it nerfs refreshing towards the end of bubble life but you don't have to keep dipping in and out"
Which now that Ithink about it is really only a huge help on the third encounter in gos

what's the recommended power for the dungeon?
looks like 940
oh EZ
not bad.
also this weeks ordeal is a garden world. so probably isn't that bad for a master nightfall.
I'll definitely want to do that tomorrow night.

im actually kind of impressed with momentum control
i thought this was gunna be an awful gamemode but it's honestly not bad
like swat you will get kills if you go for headshots
my blast furnace was one bursting i think jade rabbit was one tapping
best part: no radar
going for body shots wont do you too well
idk why people are ven using recluse in this gamemode its kind of funny

@Destiny [PC] raid tonight?
I’d be down probably
so we just need 3 more then
i won't be back until like 11 so unfortunately a no go for me.
and welcome to PC! @SpaceOlympx3022
i thought i made it for wednesday lol.
^ okay @Destiny [PC] master nightfall for tomorrow night
i might be down for a raid depends on what time
might go do xenophage quest
goal is now officially one of us
true pc player
you can't go back
i went to ps4 to play with my best friend and my eyes literally *hurt*
*one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us one of us*
Hahaha I tried going back to the ps4 version a little bit ago. The fov alone was messing me up
uhhh yeah hahaha.
"the difference is wild. my console IRL friends are like ""I'm sure you can't even really tell"" and i'm just like no you CAN AND WILL😩"

"I hear the FOV, especially in first person games, makes for the biggest long term difference"
@Destiny [PC] anyone on the last part of xenophage and want to do the dungeon?
need one more
58 for me is unplayable
144hz panel owners rise up
Did anyone get into the Halo Reach PC flight?
I did not :c
Leviathans breath and xenophage are the same exotic
"Slow firing, massive damage heavies in a usually quick firing low damage archetype"
@here anyone for the final encounter of the dungeon with me and nahkriin
"In that sense,  yeah I suppose so"
managed to two man the rest but we're stuck
we're in voicechat
"In discord with my friend but I’ve already done it so it’ll be like a strike with a random, after that if there’s a third person around that wants to I’m gonna run in with my friend on another character"
thanks for the help
"No problem, speaking of anyone online want to run the new dungeon?"
chance and i got xenophage
it's shit
literal garbage
"It is more than likely a bug, but as of right now it **cannot** do any kind of precision damage"
"And It does about 1/3rd of the damage of a Worm shot, since we're comparing against something in the same slot"
Yeah the only possible use for it currently is it two body shot kills in crucible haha
you get 4 shots from a brick
so
Lol why bungie
i can't see a universe where using it over a hammerhead or even leviathan's breath
is ever worth it
considering it's not needed for Undying I'm in no rush to get it haha. honestly I've really liked Leviathans Breath as another heavy exotic.
this is a pretty bungo'd exotic
i guess it looks cool?
LB has a really fantastic niche for unstoppable champions. also used with the class item mod that gives heavy ammo on finishers for 1/10 of your super is...*chefs kiss*👌
1/10th?
you sure about that?
http://prntscr.com/ppxb2f
was thinking of the one that reloads all your weapons.
but yeah that mod...is so nice.
i don't have enough care to memorize all that mod shit😂
yeah this gun is kind of butt
idk why they though no precision shots would be a good idea for this
you only get 3 shots in pvp and its a 2 tap
I've never been so disappointed in an exotic
IT DOESNT EVEN HAVE AN ANTI CHAMPION MODIFIER EITHER
this actually might be the worst exotic in the game
worse than leviathans breath?
worst exotic in the game?
LB is very good.
It's more like a rocket launcher
https://tenor.com/7VjP.gif
i think youre overlooking a lot of exotics
to call xenophage the worst
do you have xeno lol
Idk man I’ll back it up
we both do
i just used it in gambit
it's BAD
go use skyburner's oath right now
....
Sky burners rips in crucible
used it for like the first fourth of my randys quest
Or
i can't contribute to this.
Yeah I got destroyed by skyburners last night
Imagine Skyburners but in the heavy slot
i think...as far as *heavy* exotics go...
tell me one exotic that is bad and I'll tell you why xeno is still worse
at least skyburners can do precision damage LOL
skyburn also doesnt have damage fall off
skyburner's oath
and its not a heavy
sturm
you can still use a worthwhile heavy with skyburn :))
sweet business
sweet buisness got buffed in shadowkeep tho
i heard but i haven't seen it around
the only reason sturm is unpopular is because the meta isnt double primary anymore like it used to be
Sweet Business shreds
why would you use a kinetic exotic when Revoker exists👀👀
its still very fun to use
and they just buffed sweet business
aint bad
sturm is fucking amazing
also can do precision damage
same with sturm
but I don't see any of y'all rocking sturm or sweet business or skyburners or etc. 👀
just sayin
shut up
i was talking about sturm just the other day
your wrong
in the pvp channel
Xenophage is a sniper rifle with extra steps except it cant crit
"So even with those all not being great, they all can at least do precision damage"
and it doesnt even have a anti champion modifier like ALL the other new exotics do
I think max ammo with reserve is 26?
so 2 clips
I used xenophage on the new dungeon boss for one damage round and using my full reserves I still did less than one izanagi shot
I see absolutely no reason to use this gun
I dont even see how it can be fun to use
compared to something like sturm or sweet business
thats all i need to hear
i just finished the quest
sturm and a drang baroque smacks
thanks crizum
lol I understand what yall are saying
ready for dissapointment
welcome to the club mr spitfire
I just think it's a bit early to label it as trash and never use it again
how
how would it be too early
maybe if it got a buff tomorrow
maybe if they fix the precision damage
If it just did precision damage
It might actually be useful
I just think there is probably more to the gun than we are looking at
"It has to compete against Whisper and any other GL and that's where the issue really comes in, and it can't compete with others in its own weapon class"
Not every exotic is supposed to be a DPS machine
it explodes
in a very small radius
"Could be for ad clear, majors, i dunno"
i think leviathans breath has a larger radius
so why not use that
"no, I think I'd rather have 21% or hammerhead"
it can also stop unstoppable champions
more efficient add clearing
literally anything it better for add clear
I don't think it'd be good for bungie to release every single exotic being better than the last
I bet a blue sidearm is better for add clear
i cant believe it doesnt have a champion mod
yes but this one isn't even redundant
it just sucks
hasn't it been like that for a while though trissin?
new exotics always being better
where every exotic is better than the last?
"not in my opinion, no"
maybe not in all cases but it seems to be true
So with something like leviathans breath even though it matches precision and does less body damage than sleeper I can see the place in the sandbox Bungie intended for it. It’s unstoppable rounds make up for it not being insane and the knock back is interesting
"sweet business, sturm, and skyburn are all year one weapons"
which happen to be your examples of bad exotics
do i see a trend here
"Lol, okay okay"
We are all entitled to our own opinions here
ok wish ender
I don't have xenophage yet so I can't make as clear of a judgement quite yet
there might end up being a use for it idk. but just from what I've heard it sounds incredibly underwhelming considering all the other heavy exotics we have.
"Erianas Vow is an interesting concept, and this is as well. A slow firing heavy machine gun could be really interesting, but with no mod and thus no place in nightfalls it comes down to do I use this, or do I get comparable heavy damage with a legendary and rock one of the interesting exotics from Shadowkeep"
opinion or not xenophage is objectively one of the worst exotics in the game
maybe even one of the worst weapons in the power slot
that might be a bit much tho
"You can't really talk about this being a matter of opinion when the weapon can't survive in the suggested role, and can't compare/compete with weapons in its own weapon class that aren't even exotic"
I think they intended it to be an invader killing weapon that isn’t heavy machine gun bad on AI enemies
"honestly, i dont even care if its a bad gun"
its at least interesting and has good story tied to it
I honestly thought this weapon was gunna take over gambit
"But that’s hard to balance for in crucible, two body shots to kill is nice as it matches all precision shots on hammerhead, but you only get 4 rounds?"
I haven't had a chance to acquire it yet
but the fact that it cant even do precision damage
both very important parts of the exotic weapon type
means its almost worthless
I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy or not that it doesnt one tap in pvp
"Precision damage lacking may or may not be intended, and they can always fix or catalyst fix it. As it stands it’s a boring retread of a weapon that just came out a week ago lol"
I feel like it would be a bug?
it just doesnt seem right
"I mean if you want my opinion, its a cool gun"
I was excited to get it
its nice to shoot
but its bad
it dont do the big yellow number
not big yellow number bad
I love everything about it except that I can’t justify taking it over an exotic sniper
"That's the crux of the argument, yes"
or any other heavy for that matter
"I’ll have to test it further, some streamer may find some godly use for it"
taking it is basically unjustifiable
I can do its job better with a kinetic special weapon
It will probably be nuts in Mayhem
doubtful
you only get 3 in mayhem i think
but i guess if you weapons of light up it one taps
but still you could use anything else and get the same or better result
if this gun is going to remain not going precision damage
then they should definitely up the RPM and reserves imo
atleast for pve
"Even if it could do precision damage I think Xenophage would be an indictment of an ongoing issue with D2's design, and it's obsolescence as soon as the new stuff comes out, they just blew their load in forsaken and now they don't know what to do"
I think Bungie needs to take a page out of Ratchet and Clank's playbook
or gearbox
"To be fair, I really like the design of Deathbringer. But the space is so crowded it doesn't feel as unique, and it's power is still very much overshadowed"
"yeah. i enjoy using deathbringer. stuff like vex offensive makes it fun to use stuff out of the box like that. but as far as practical, endgame usage things are still the usual."
Anybody doing the last step of Xenophage right now?
i like just did it rip
that dungeon is aids
"the first and mid part is ok, midpart with the tunnels is super cool"
the end part is extremely stupid
what why is that
"I like this dungeon, it feels really immersive and fairly interesting"
"The mechanics are not complex, but also can't be ignored"
I really didn't like how it was rinse and repeat for the final boss
you literally kill the same 3 mobs like 4 times to get to damage phase on the boss
I didn't play it all the way through yet i just went far enough for xenophage
the first encounter gave me blighttown vibes
from dark souls
anyone attempt the master nightfall yet or know of any strats for it? might just look it up but jw.
It should be pretty easy honestly. It's garden world so it's pretty much just kill all the enemies and go slowly so you don't die
yeah that's what i figured. it's just for the completion so taking things slow is probs just the best.
"I’ll likely run izanagi recluse spike launcher (depending on setup, maybe machine gun), and well lock"
Recluse w overload or whichever
that's fine. i'll be on tether. i have exit strategy w/ anti barrier and recluse with overload. i'll also probs use leviathan's breath for unstoppable stuff and get a build going for that.
Lev breath seems great
The inly thing is the knockback ill have to time my izanagi shots
"yeah, and considering it's just for completion we can really take our time with it. play things safe and whatnot."
Nightfall 950 anyone?
i would but i have class soon :(((
@Kronohs I can do 950

literally the exact same song
"@Rye it probably bought music, its quite common actually that trailers share music"
except that that song isn't from a trailer
its from the game
its a song that plays whenever you beat a level in saints row 3
the best one though was the GOT trailer using the music from the TRON ost
kek
did they really?
@Rye It could be that the music in saints row 3 is actually bought as well
wouldn't think that Deep Silver would do that
It's more common than you think
It doesn’t phase me cause I’m old and I remember most of the Megaman soundtrack being what amounts to covers of rock songs
But yeah lots of game music shares sections with other game songs
"song is called ""Bit Rate"" by Johnny James"
Also there's a cat on top of the tree and it appears to be purring
the tree behind Eva I mean
has anyone attempted a solo dungeon clear yet
i want that solo flawless emblem bad
I have not attempted a solo
doing it with 3 people was still hard
i think i might attempt one tonight after my midterm
Give it a go!!!
Why do I have like 8000 things due now
I want to play the new content
This one is more difficult than solo flawless shattered throne I think
man all of my shit was due right around shadowkeeps launch and i did not manage my time well
so it'll be a good challenge
i got trash marks on like 3 midterms but im bouncing back now lol
"but no, I gotta design a drill jig, make a video for a QA presentation, work on some statics assignment and don't even get me started on calculus (I mostly blame the program required for online work)"
what are you taking?
do you guys use webwork
fuck webwork
"No, MyMathLab"
Which is horrible
Mechanical Engineering is what I'm taking.
typing in these massive answers into webwork makes me want to die
damn engineering
i dont think i could handle that heavy a work load
normally it's not that bad
"Every so often though all the profs get together and say ""okay now we just hit them with every assignment possible"" /s"
lol im getting destroyed rn i had like 4 midterms in one week 2 on one day and these excel assignments that our prof marks so hard like its not even funny. The class average for our first assignment in my excel econ class was a 46%
ooooooooooof
yea i was expecting the class to be relatively easy but holy its probably one of the hardest classes ive taking in all my years so far
best of luck to all of you with your classes
damn my webcam that says it was delivered today might have been swiped from my door...people suck.
but good thing Amazon will replace it for free😩
ooh no!!
That horrible
it's weird tho bc it says delivered at 2 and my roommate left at 215. so either someone was quick to swipe it or it went to the wrong apt.
bc I've had plenty of things delivered this year and no issues at all.
"Oof, imagine if that was something absolutely essential"
yeah for real. like thankfully amazon is so good that they will replace it or just refund me the money so i can order it again.
but imagine if it really was stolen people are so sad man...
Utter pricks
but ik sometimes they mark it as delivered but the truck is still on its way. idk they're sending the driver back so curious to see what he has😂
Yeah that might've happened. In India almost all Amazon package are *paid* cash on delivery so little chance of getting swiped
I don't think Amazon US has that option?
"@thegoaliebear do you have a seperate mailbox? My package that came today said it was at the door, but was actually in the mailbox"
yeah I've checked my apt mailbox and the big boxes they put packages in sometimes.
like...i know I'll get the refund if it is missing so not worried about that...just sucks knowing people really are that sad to go around swiping packages or blatantly taking them in if it was delivered to the wrong place.
sounds like ontrac oramazon delivery service. those delivery guys suck. they'll mark it delivered and then actually deliver it hours later just to pad their delivery times and stuff. guy probably wanted to get lunch and was pressed for time
yeah I'm hoping that's what it is. they said they're sending the delivery guy back to the area so honestly it might just be that he never delivered it in the first place lol.
but time will tell.
@thegoaliebear wow that suxs
Can't wait for robotic/drone delivery
imagine you're someone tryna swipe the package and the drone just laser beams you.
that would be so great.
I'm willing to risk the Terminator future if it means I always get my fancy umbrella on time
hell ya
Did anyone see the Death Stranding release trailer? It was so incredibly confusing
Bungie should honestly consult Kojima to write their stories
It'd be glorious
like...i won't be getting the game regardless. but idk how i feel about it lol. visually tho...looks stunning.
It looks like what I imagined games should like when I was a kid
guys in the new crucible game mode wish ender one taps and gives wall hacks infinitely with the hunter gauntlets oathkeeper
its fun when on spectral
Oh yeah it's super easy to get scout kills as well
I love it
You’re literally satan
And I’d be so down for Kojimas take on the vex
"Shame about PT, and pretty much everything with Konami."
huzzah! camera was not stolen. just delivered lmao.
so just a guy padding his delivery time.
yay!!
gawt dang stat padders
which is weird because I've never actually had that happen. whenever it says delivered i always come back to the package there.
but...just glad it wasn't stolen haha.
its the non union guys
Fed ex and UPS dont fuck with that shit
its the Ontrac and Amazon Delivery guys that are just private contractors
UMM
burgersandwich?
Ron thanks for being so innocent
fuck
"And maybe, I don’t honestly know what his name is supposed to be"
wouldn't be surprised if burger got censored
rip warmind
@thegoaliebear 8:30 for nightfall right?
I absolutely LOVE this new crucible gamemode
im enjoying it so much
the ability to use less used weapons super effectively allows for all sorts of new strats
suros regine on the slow fire mode?
124 damage per headshot!
its amazing
my blast furnace was one bursting
only needed 3 of the bullets to hit head
its so fun
was nice to finish off the precision kill portion of the redrix quest
unfortunately it seems bungo counted for grenade launchers
they dont feel like they are doing much more damage tbh
maybe im  just bad
fighting lion one shots
i took my fighting lion in there but was getting nailing them down to 10 hp 90% of the time
the other 10% was one shots
its ultra inconsistent
not entirely sure why
maybe im just bad
one guy i fought was really consistant
I ran in to invis hunters with jade rabbits on widows court
probably becuase of its weird fireing thing
The game mode is garbage
it aint a bad gamemode until you start running into trace rifles and wraith hunters with 150 rpm scouts holding crouch all game
"It's not bad, could be really good, but the one-tap Jade Rabbits are annoying"
the favorite part in all honesty is the no radar
there is no long drawn out OEM fights
fast paced gameplay
See I liked halo and I don’t like cod
^^^ yeah it seems most exotics are basically useless
which is also really nice
So fast TTK is ass
im more of a halo person as well
but there are some nice things about it compared to regular Destiny pvp
some
my favorite part honestly is just coming up with cool unique builds
because its more than hand cannons snipers and shottys
not to mention recluse mountaintop everywhere
oh and i did find out that 150 rpm scouts are the only archetype of scouts that will one tap headshot
it was hilarious running into ppl using recluse in that gamemode
i dont tihnk i ever died to one
and once people finish randys the scouts should fade out
hopefully
really tired of them dang scoutsb0ss
wonder how far slug shotties can on tap in that mode
another thing to discover i suppose
I did get sniped by the Chaperone a couple of times but that might not be unique to this mode
have you ever one bodied with an auto?
well now you can with Cerberus catalyst
the catalyst almost turns it into a shotgun
what is this new crucible mode yall talking about.
"won't spoil, go in and look!"
its called momentum control
but try it out for yourself if you have a chance its the best
that name explains nothing btw
yeah lol
i promised myself i wouldn't touch pvp afyer getting randys so y'all can share haha.
but its fuuuuuuuuuuuuun
unlike actual crucible
"it is actually fun, i was pleasantly surprised"
the cerberus cata does turn it into a shotgun
not almost
a 33 round high rate of fire shotgun
maybe i should be that wraith hunter so i can get my randy's
"I had this weird dream the other day where I was on the last encounter of the vault of grass raid, and there was some easter egg in the fight that we triggered. It made everything turn dark, the boss disappeared and this army of weird vex sea creatures emerged from the vex milk pool. Afterwards I was awarded this cool trace rifle that tethered to nearby enemies"
wouldnt that be a cool idea
Why does your dream sound like the middle of a Stephen King novel
Hey @Chance what’s the over/under on a cheeky mention of Xenophage in twab tomorrow?
Idk b0ss i cant see the future
ok this nightfall is rough lmao.
gonna wait for next week's nightfall 😂
Has anyone got the essence of envy to drop for them? Still haven’t seen it and the internet is less than helpful
its apparently a secret chest in the dungeon @Crizum
is it the chest near the exotic quest boss?
Got the damn sword essence from that chest
This is quite possible the greatest quest line in Destiny history:
"Just random looted Sweet Business, low key wanna change my name to T800."
Oh there's a free emblem for finishing up the Festival of the Lost quest at bungie.net/rewards
don't forget to pick that up
"Also, my first week raid completion jacket code will expire tomorrow so in case anyone wants it, here you go:"
BRS8-LMCC-FNRV-XR7D-XVKF
^ @Destiny [PC] doing haunted forest tonight if anyone wants to join warmind just didn't have a selection for it aha.
"@thegoaliebear Would love to make it to the end with y’all tonight, assuming that’s the goal here 🙂 all I have is my lock but I’ll run top tree void for that boss burn."
i haven't done any of it yet lol. never bothered with it last year either but got nothing better to do haha. I'm down going for full completion tho.
but naturally I'll be on my hunter.
"Running Misfit, I presume?"
"It’s pretty straightforward, all about speed and boss burning to get to branch 9. I’ve made it to branch 7 with rando matchmaking. With y’all’s expertise and a purpose built group, we’ll get it this time. I’ll probably run business, sniper/HC, and love. Seems to chew through there pretty quick."
Just use Chaos Reach geomag stabilizers
It’ll save everyone ammo and almost 100-0 every boss up to about 11
@Chance and I did tether hunter and chaos reach+geomag
"just got those boots, i'll go that route"
even with bad randos we would hit brand 10+pretty easily
make sure you put the special mod on your mask
it helps a ton
Don’t do pinnacle stuff next week until Thursday. They are making the drops +2 instead of +1
that was the only thing i really didn't like about the PL grind. +1 is way too underwhelming for doing the pinnacle activities of the game lol.
I finally started getting 952 gear on warlock haha
"i just didn't like that you could go up without all of your slots pinnacle, and GoS has no heavy weapon"
Wonder if iron banner bounties are still bugged and how soon we’ll see people grind those out to 960
i just saw a guy with the name butthead but butt wasnt censored >: (
bungo whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
what the heck bungo
guess in just too powerful for bungo
IT IS FINISHED
"@Buttkikker it’s a steam thing, use Unicode letters I think"
that was a lot of work for some legendary shards and enhancement cores
OKAY WHAT THE ACTUALY FUCK
I guess bungo doesnt want me to play warlock
I have a full set up dreambane equiped but i cant start the last campaign mission
"I've unequipped re-equipped the armor, killed myself, reloaded the area, went back into orbit and reloaded the area again, and even restarted my game"
and I still cant start the mission
love how this bug is still in the game since release and its somehow worse?
no wait ignore all that im retarded
forgot you need to talk to eris first after getting a full set
for some dumbass reason
makes 0 sense
thanks bungo i now feel like an idiot
Antone know what happens if you play destiny 2 on pc without the shadowkeep dlcs when you have it on ps4?
you can't access shadowkeep activities if you don't have it on pc.
@Peronix @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) i'm in voice chat whenever you guys wanna join no rush at all tho.
"Well I mean if I have shadowkeep gear, will it still let me use it?"
oh yeah you can use all your gear still.
"you just wont be able to get new shadowkeep drops, or do shadowkeep activities"
Finally done exit strategy
just edgewise left and im don
done*
oh woah congrats
!browse lfg
!lfg browse
@Arixama in here
has anyone gotten edgewise yet?
"@Pentan that was actually my last run for the night, sorry!"
aw man
well at least it was with someone special
c ya later
i remember the forest being easier
you used to get extra time per wave cleared
So I'm currently soloing the new dungeon as practice for solo flawless
In the tunnels with the ogres
"even after unlock all the gates and you get ""objective complete"""
the ogres will _continue_ to attack and kill you
"and if you die here, it just sets you back to the last encounter again?"
oh that sucks
i wonder if you have to go right into the next area and start the next encounter.
It seems like it
the tunnels are so hard
you get stuck in a room with ogres on both sides
people are saying this was easier than solo flawless ST???
no way imo
holy edgewise is so short to get
"@Destiny [PC] for those that don’t read twab, Bungie Bounty this Saturday at 10am pacific, play momentum control and if you get a match with King Gothalion and win you get the emblem"
emblem?
oh i see
"folks if you're grinding for Randy's, put on a fast charging fusion and head into momentum control"
I went from 8% to 52% medals in 5 or so matches
@Trissin i think the tunnels and the encounter after it are the toughest for a solo flawless. but the other encounters seem easy enough.
i-
I'm actually so sad the bounty is this week
I'm at work when the bounty starts and won't be done until after it ends
yeah i have a game today :/
hah thanks. likely not playing at all this weekend tho my wisdom teeth decided to start coming in yesterday so it's pretty painful 😂
yeah that's always painful as hell
i was about to make one for this and then realized this was at the exact time i'd be available lol.
if a third wants to join that would be great.
Tunnels were hard at first but honestly it was because I didn't know the terrain and didn't understand the ogre pathing/aggression
I stopped trying at totem because I realized I was underlevelled and the red-bar adds were shredding me in my well lol
im gonna be on vacation for a week so ill be completely unavailable
feelsbadman
well...i need all my wisdom teeth out so I'll be out of commission for the next week or so haha.
I had all of mine removed at once
be careful not to smile too much or laugh too much afterwards for like 3-4 weeks
you'll pull your stiching out like I did
that is not fun
at all
I'm just happy i don't have to fuck with hockey for a bit now😂
Anyone want to raid today? I have the rest of the day off and want to give it a go
Did part of my first raid (leviathan) with another LFG last week and it was a lot of fun
i won't be back from my game until at least 10:45 est tonight. so likely is a no go for me.
@Kronohs i would set up an lfg post here if people are interested or if they can make it they'll join it.
"@thegoaliebear gotcha, thanks will do. Using the warmind bot?"
@Destiny [PC] ^ if anyone is interested.
@rozak
We out here
if we have people who dont know how to do it either i am good teacher
"idk how to do it, would love to try it"
"@Chance thank you! That would be helpful, as I only know how to do two of the areas"
but if you guys want more experienced players im fine to give my spot
looking for a chill run so you're definitely welcome
it's Leviathan. yall will be fine haha.
unexperienced players welcome I mainly want to help @rozak get keys and stuff for year 1 exotics
the more people im helping the better
and yeah its really easy
i had a team of 3 experience and 3 not and we basically one shot every encounter
actually it seems my wife is having some health problems; it's possible I'll end up needing to leave soon so I think it'll be best if I sit this out
bummer
have fun y'all
"gonna restart my pc, brb"
I'm gonna be running 2 of my kinderguardian friends through Leviathan tomorrow at 7 (ET) with another buddy of mine.
We have 2 spots open atm
"So yeah, if you're interested hmu"
"No experience or anything necessary, it's a chill run"
@Trissin I would like to run
gamers
are we raiding?
gunna need 2 more homies tho
"yo @Trissin I'm down, I haven't done levi in forever"
well its been a half hour guess no ones coming
"I liked the Diablo 4 cinematic, but Xol spoke the line ""There is no light here"" way better imo"
"Awesome, thanks for filling in @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 and @RonInDune"
does anyone want to run a 980 nightfall?
just want to finish my undying badge
undying requires 980 nightfall?
The ship you get from the 980 triumph is needed for the season badge
@Spitfire2266 this weeks nf is brutal.I'm waiting until next week to see which one it is.
"@thegoaliebear same here, I L&D’d and nova’d myself into a fine mist in that final encounter @920; those materializing walls aren’t having any of my shit so I stayed at the shallow end of the pool this week."
Oh god @Trissin I see what you mean by the ogres killing you in the pit even after completing the encounter
I'm so mad
"Lol yeah, they just keep going"
I didn't finish my solo run because I realized it would probably be better to be above 950 lol
"I couldn't even get the final lore piece, very sad now"
Really not a fan of the dungeon deciding to kill me randomly when going to the pit encounter
That happen to anyone else? Move beyond the loading zone and it just murders you?
Yeah it happened to me mulitple times while going up elevators in the first encounter
It's a framerate issue. A lot of people say limiting your frames to 30 during that section fixes the problem
Lol the hardest part of a flawless run is Bungie being Bungie
so i just cleared the 10th branch in haunted forest but it didn't count as 9 cleared in a run for the pinnacle gear
whaaat
the only thing i can think of is that we ended by dying rather than killing the 11th boss
unfortunately something has come up and I won't be online tonight. sorry about the dungeon run
i might give this master nighfall a go but yea i dont think garden world is a good one to do it on
"The 950 version is still incredibly difficult, and I saw the way goal and peronix and the others got slapped around in the 980"
I'll wait till it's the EDZ one
I was watching EK do it on his stream. it's very brutal. even his team struggled with it for a while and only got one clear in all the time I was watching.
if it becomes that one during the season
there will definitely be one that's better. garden world is so awful because of how open the whole thing is.
"thanks again @RonInDune and @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 , hope yall had a good time"
"inverted spire was a really good one for it, because theres a lot of spots where you can just have someone kinda hang back and keep the encounter going if your teammates die"
there's a spot in garden world you can do that as well.
let's do a scourge run soon trissin! I want anarchy!
i doubt I'll be back at school next week to try. but I'm not worried about it. it's honestly kind of ridiculous how hard the 980 is.
"@Trissin thank you, it was pretty fun"
and partly has to do with how shit they made the PL grind lol. the +2 pinnacle drops should help climb closer to being a more adequate PL for it.
this vanguard quest first watch is making me mental having to get all the ability kills in nightfalls
its so boring lol
ok it's kinda hard to solo the <secret weapon> final boss
"Yeah, I'd definitely recommend grabbing a second from somewhere"
Do we have enough people to try for some Scourge runs tonight?
guaranteed Anarchy drops
I would love to join but unfortunately im busy
All you need for Anarchy is to change your steam name to start with Criz
"Ah well Trissin, next time!"
I'm down for some Scourge runs
well im down
uhhh what was the command again
"^^
Good luck you guys, hope you get anarchy + fallen armaments!"
GIVE ANARCHY PLS
change name to criz*
it's guaranteed
100% success rate
Really buttkikker doesn’t need to because it’s either crizkikker or buttcrizzer and either are bad
go clear the boss more @Oathbreaker
I intend to
raid is about to start soon yeah? If so I need just a few minutes guys
i'll finish up some bounties meanwhile
logging in now.
Can we get a +1 for Scourge final boss?
We'll be doing two boss runs for Anarchy
i hate titans
we hate u too 😘
<3
It's easy to deal with titans if you know their secret rules
Guys it’s literally one exotic and it’s getting nerfed
"as long as they don't nerf the disco helmet, I'm still good with titans"
Titans will be back in the dumpster soon and the hunters can be pleased being unchallenged
Really titans and warlocks should band together
I honestly hated the spectral blades meta more than one eyed mask
I honestly wish sentinel shield had the wacky hit detection spectral blades has
"Btw that “punch stuff until dead” flowchart should be updated cause it isn’t a Titan thing anymore, that’s a liars handshake flowchart"
Titans have other options too.
"Fun loadout with Duke, Ashen Wake, Fusion Grenades, and Eriana's is good if you can aim. Eriana's 1-taps to the head with First Glance and bottom tree Sunbreaker with the Sun Warrior perk active."
"I’ll be fine with Monte Carlo and top tree sunbreaker or bottom tree sentinel with suppression grenades. I just don’t like the “fuck titans they’re broken” when it’s really just OEM. It’s warlocks turn anyway, let’s give them a buff or an exotic to reign over everyone for 6 or so months lol"
ah the nova warp days were fun
Nova Warp/Contraverse Holds
"Nova warp is in a good spot now, not as OP as the first days of Forsaken and not as badly nerfed as they were right after"
"Speaking of warlocks, how is getaway artist in momentum control?"
"It's inconsistent, by the time they fire you're already dead"
Just corner camp with your arc buddy
Boo
contraverse hold and nova warp is how i got fabled last season lol
@Destiny [PC] put up a crown run for later tonight if anyone is interested
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JTnuuVYMyi0
Oh I saw Gladd doing this last night
What now
Basically negates the hardest encounter
Well that kind of ruins things
I wonder when they'll patch it out
hopefully soon
Hey anyone want to intern at Bungie?
http://careers.bungie.com/en-us/careers/internship/1941946/ui-visual-design-intern
got taken armaments
Bungie is in Seattle yeah?
just been doing the free chest every week on all chars
"That's real damn close to Vancouver, maybe I'll apply"
that would be cool!
Definitely go for it!
Trissin you’re in Washington?
"Though this position is in Bellevue, WA"
You live like 30 minutes away if so haha
Oh mbmb
I thought Bungie was in Seattle for some reason
I'm actually in Canada haha
Vancouver
Bellevue is like right next to Seattle though
"Ahh, I dunno why I thought Vancouver Canada was further"
Also why is Washington the state on the other side of the Universe from Washington the city
id love to apply to bungo but visual design isn't my thing
More dets about the job offer:
and I've no experience in it
it wouldn't be a good fit for either of us
Ah tough luck then
@RonInDune i believe Washington the city came first
Could you Imagine if John Hancock had been the first president though? We'd have Hancock D.C. And Hancock the state
that is very correct lol.
2 more for crown tonight at 9 EST?
Should be able to find enough
you guys still looking for crown?
We’re in discord @RonInDune and @Sabre
@Destiny [PC] ^ for upcoming Sunday since pinnacle drops will be +2 now.
i also may change my mind to a master nightfall depending what the strike ends up being tomorrow.
"I still need divinity and haven't done a run in a bit, so down"
My bird
BIRD
UP
Majestic...
this week's nightfall is Strange Terrain. how bad do we think it'll be on Master?
Nokris? Probably not nice. There isn’t a whole lot of space to hide around in and without the Izanagi/Divinity wombo combo idk
its nokris not xol i thought for strange terrain
Ah yeah that’s who I was thinking of but names
if its nokris itll be rough you cant insta kill the boss
the ogre in the middle is pretty squishy and its a shortish strike so i dont think it will be impossible
Smart tether usage and well/bubble for sure
i wanna play destiny rn but i need to finish my calculus assignment which i have 0 motivation to do
i might give the master NF a go. maybe monday.
I play w randoms so 920 it's hard enough lol
yeah definitely depends on the strike. pyramidion and inverted spire weren't bad at all. but strange terrain can get pretty brutal.
i wish i had had the time to do the master nf when it was pyramidion.
Probably will be easier when you can hit at least 970 with pinnacle rewards and the artifact boost
yeah. mainly why i wanted to do the raid on sunday instead of try for the master completion. those +2 drops will help a lot.
Looks like the first raid challenge has been solved ||only the team without the harpy boss kills their cyclops||
i totally forgot those were a thing now.
"Misunderstood for a minute, edited clarification"
seems tough
"Well, you could just use a Titan? Bubble them off"
"Not sustainable, but I think it isn’t terribly hard at current light levels"
"The reward for doing it is pinnacle too, so it’s worth attempting"
yeah definitely worth the effort
i mean...i don't mind trying it on Sunday. but if we don't get it during the encounter i don't want to get caught up on it. mainly just want the clear.
Anyone doing Iron Banner?
Team up?
"After doing the first part of Banshee’s quest for the bow, I got terrible flashbacks from Zero Hour"
oh hey @Thawxtem haven't seen you on for a while! Welcome back!
"Oh, do you need solo flawless pit for harbinger?"
"You just need to solo, and do a run where you don’t die"
"Ah people have figured out the first Raid challenge already, if you do it you get an extra pinnacle chest drop at the end of that encounter"
yeah we were saying we might try it on sundays run. but not a huge deal if we don't get it and i don't really want to get caught up on trying it haha.
"It's honestly fairly easy, just run around to try and not get sniped"
Love hackers in crucible
The ones that go from lowest on their team to a 3.57 and two team pulls from 40 down to almost mercy ruling you in about two minutes
yeah just like the guys obsolete peronix and i ran into in comp one night haha.
"So for the pit run with no deaths, you could just grab a final boss checkpoint on a different character, and keep reseting the checkpoint if you die?"
woah does that work?
"There are three triumphs, one for solo, one for no deaths, and one for solo no deaths. Idk about using a boss checkpoint but I assume if you can’t solo flawless the easiest would be grabbing two people who don’t mind dying and letting them do the heavy lifting haha"
wait @Arixama are you for real
No way that works
Because solo flawless ST is pretty strict
"if anyone joins at any time, or if you leave at any time, you don't get the triumph"
I can't imagine they'd change it for the new dungeon
But if it's just a completion with you not dying?
for just flawless? I don't think it would work either
But I don't know
Did you see it somewhere on reddit?
"No, just a thought I had"
I can't imagine bungie haven't also thought of this though
I mean you say that
But also
Bungie does have a history of not thinking of obvious things sometimes
only way to find out is to try lol.
We need a sacrificial lamb
*baaaaa*
Does anyone want to give a go at the master nightfall me and @HShmoob are going to run it
wish i could.
"@Arixama you mean like how they seem to do the ""all one element subclass"" runs? Where you don't have to get them all done in one raid, just have to have completed the different encounters at some point?"
"another example would I guess be nobody getting the curse debuff in crown, my triumph popped during the jumping crystal encounter because it was the last one I completed with nobody getting the debuff"
If it were that way it'd have the tick boxes for each encounter. I'm just curious if it's specifically looking for the boss encounter being completed with no deaths
should be the whole dungeon
just finished master nightfall
not bad at all
boss was way easier than i expected
finally done
what classes were you guys running.
if it's not bad I'd like to get it done when I'm back at school.
The more important question I think is what light levels you were at
the screenshot they sent was 963.
honestly the only section i could see being super hard is the ogre. the boss is probably decently challenging but not too bad since you can get a lot of burst damage on him. prior areas there's lots of places to go back and hide or leave someone so the encounter keeps going.
We had me on well my friend on tether and a random with bubble
2 izanagi 1 divinity
Wendigo was good for dropping a arc shields and I ran edgewise for the solar wizard shields
It wasn’t bad at all
Took us just under 40 mins
rephrase that without izanagis 😜
and say Revoker instead.
Maybe whisper instead>
high key yeah.
Darci*
or that.
either is fine. i just wanna get it done lmao.
"Leviathan's breath, actually 😂"
"Whisper still does more damage if you can get consistent crits, which might be hard on Nokris"
yeah i think darci is a better substitute for bosses that flinch around a lot.
I wish Malfeasance did bonus damage on hive as well
well...maybe i will try to get a run on sunday or monday for it. would be nice to head into undying mind week with that done.
True I might try to get one done as well
How's the tooth ache progressing BTW
it's not that bad now. but i imagine tomorrow it will be pretty achy aha.
"oof, my condolences"
i just hate that this week i had to miss out on time i could play D2 since i don't have that much school work to do.
but oh well. maybe sunday I'll get back early enough to get some of that stuff done.
"ah well what can you do, gotta yeet the teeth someday"
Now *that’s* a quote
i need to get hive armaments for if i try solo dungeon
"We tried for Hive armaments yesterday, got my second Tarrabah but still no armaments"
i might try to do crown i dont really wanna run heroic menagerie
"I like doing Crown, it's fast and some of the weapons are pretty decent"
Plus the armour looks super fly
I think a one two punch shotgun drops there
Abort the baby cabal
Let’s see how long I last with my new name inspired by that run
"AbortionClinic, not censored. Buttkikker, censored"
"Yes, sensei?"
"People seem to dig the name, they stop shooting in crucible"
They know they have to melee you
OH MY GOD NOOOOOOO
SOLO FLAWLESS PIT
LAST DAMAGE PHASE
BOSS HAD LIKE 40 HP LEFTR
HE BOOPED ME
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
"oh nooo, I'm so sorry"
THIS IS WHY I HATE WARLOCK JUMP
Try again after Thursday reset
So that you get +2 pinnacles
I HAD HIM
HE ACTUALLY HAD LIKE
JUST A SLIVER OF HEALTH LEFT
AAAAAAAAAGGGGHHHHH
Destiny is a cruel mistress
i'm debating if I should reset my progress and try again
i think I will
i can't believe this
You'll get it next time! I believe in you!
next time is in about another hour or so
it's very doable
i'm gonna stop myself for tonight
i'm getting impatient and frustrated and making dumb mistakes
i died on the _platforming maze_ part twice
now
because I want to get to the boss
so i'm rushing this part where I really should be careful
and I made that same mistake twice
I think I agree with everyone saying solo flawless ST is harder
"now that I'm not like 10 - 15 light under, ad control is not nearly as bad"
I've got the tunnels and totem part locked down
Gonna give it a better try some other time. Right now i've become too comfortable so I'm beginning to make careless mistakes
"By the next time I log off, i'm gonna have that emblem :clan_discord:"
haha nice job...you will get that solo flawless!
"so this is looking like the card i'll get for my upgrade. i've heard good things about Zotac's cards but just thought i'd run in by in case anyone thinks something else would be better. i don't really want RGB or anything on the card and this one looks pretty sleek and got good reviews.
https://www.microcenter.com/product/609526/zotac-gaming-geforce-rtx-2070-super-twin-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-30-video-card"
"especially considering i'm at 1080p/144Hz, i don't think i'll have any issues running games at max with this thing lol."
Personally not a fan of Zotac but I don't hear disastrous things about them. Only thing is it may be a louder card or have poor temps but a 2070S is a solid card for sure
"yeah fan noise isn't too much of an issue for me since my PC isn't like, right next to me aha."
i was also looking at the Gigabyte 3-fan card which is also 499.99. wasn't too sure how it compared but that one seemed like it got hotter than this one just based off review searching.
"Yeah, from what I know, Zotac > Gigabyte for GPUs but I tend to go with Asus or EVGA so I have very limited experience with the other manufacturers."
sweet. yeah since i'm going to Microcenter likely this weekend i was gonna check out the EVGA cards too. sometimes they have nice in-store only sales. all depends aha.
"For sure. Jealous of Microcenters, we don't have that in Canada. I've heard nothing but good things"
haha it is a great place. their cpu/mobo combo prices are unreal. really can't be beat.
"I have the EVGA XC 2070 pretty sure, I'd have to find it again online but it's a solid card, hits 1080p 144hz no issues. Other thing is it's a louder card, temps are pretty okay but it definitely gets loud."
"alright cool. yeah, noise definitely isn't a big deal for me. as long as it's a solid card and gives the performance i want i'm all set aha."
"Yeah for sure. I know it can hit some higher FPS (120+) on Ultra depending on location and number of particles, but because I need them frames and stability I have mine set to low for the most part."
"same, i usually go with high for certain things, but yeah most of mine are on low-medium aha."
"EVGA is one of the best partner cards, I have a 1070 that I got in 2016 that just spits on everything"
well looks like Microcenter has an EVGA 2070S for 519.99. which after rebate is 499.99.
i'll be there Friday tho so i'll check them all out aha.
"@thegoaliebear I went with the EVGA RTX 2070 Ultra and I'm extremely happy with it, zero issues (other than having to repartition an older, stubborn, dual drive system from GPT to EFI) and can run just about any game i've come across with max settings and beautiful frames (ARK Evolved almost made me cry).  It looks like Zotac got some good reviews at the cheapest price, but I don't know much about Zotac.  Zotac GPU is slightly shorter than the EVGA and only takes up 2 PCIe slots vs. EVGA @ 3 slots; so if space is a concern in your tower that's also something to consider."
if you're looking at cooling EVGA got best marks for that
thanks! yeah i have the H500 case and it's been great. haven't had any issues with cooling and space isn't a problem either since i have a pretty simple set-up. but i'll take a look at each on Friday. i'm sure i'll be fine with either of the cards. honestly might just come down to appearance for me 😂
sometimes it be like that 😄
"in fact, i picked my case with 100% SWTOR influence and custom painted it with a stormtrooper and Empire insignia.  absolutely necessary."
haha i respect it. i just have all matte black. my fans just have white LEDs so it's nice to have that soft lighting in the case.
"i'm a sucker for really simple, clean looks."
"lol, necessary"
ooh very nice. love the lighting.
"ty 🙂 she's about 8 yrs old now, some minor facelifts and modding along the way, my first full build and I nailed it."
damn 8yrs that's great you've kept that up so well! i'm excited to be making my first upgrade soon enough tho. but i made sure to do lots of future-proofing when i was picking my parts.
"also, i know someone will ask how i did the paint, so: found a SW themed font and images, printed them out in B/W. put painters tape on wax paper and then taped the B/W images to the painters tape.  Used an exacto knife to cut out images and then placed the stencil's in place and covered the rest with tape.  rustoleum spraypaint in several very light coats. viola!"
that's awesome haha.
"that is def the key, i spent a ton when i made this thing but I went for best longevity and left the door open for future components etc."
for sure. it's definitely a big upfront investment. but totally worth it when you don't have to find yourself needing something new every year aha.
"i don't *need* a new gpu, but like...Hanukkah is a thing so. worth."
what are you currently running?
"All this pc talk, I’ve always just bought pre-built machines because it was only ever for one game at a time and I didn’t need top of the line, but now I’m mostly on pc and Cyberpunk is a thing. Hopefully I get a call back on a job soon so I can sink entirely too much in to a build"
i have a 1700X and 1660 Ti @Skurrj (Pork Steeple)
"and my gpu has been great. i usually average 80-95fps in D2. it works out tho bc i have a guy at my school who would want to buy my 1660 Ti, so that's an easy way to make back some cash on it lol."
"@Crizum it is an experience like no other lol, frustrations, all the trouble shooting you ever dreamed of, and the payoff is so sweet 😄 if you make the jump, hit me up, not saying i know everything but I work on PC's as a hobby and then turned that into my own lil side business for a while.  I've seen some shit and I'd be happy to help illuminate some dark corners.  A lot of it is trying to find an answer when you don't even know what the question is."
@thegoaliebear perfect! that's exactly what i was going to say lol.
haha for real...it helps a lot to know i have someone ready to buy my old gpu off me.
I deleted my pinacle gear by mistake 😦
@CrizMobius
😵
it was a + 2 slot as well
"oof, sorry to hear that 😦 hopefully that earns you a blessing from the RNG gods"
"@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) thanks! The goal is to make space in the guest/game room for a second pc and move my wife over from the PlayStation lifestyle. Unfortunately for her she tends to get headaches when sitting in front of the monitor vs the tv, thinking it’s a settings thing she’ll have to tool around with"
I had that adjustment in Destiny. I always thought it looked pretty good and ran decently on console until I put a few hours in on pc. I got a little dizzy just putting my FPS to 30 for the dungeon
"@Crizum My man! I converted my wife and she deals with that issue as well, she's been looking for some glasses that supposedly have some blue lenses that filter out some kind of glare or brightness or something, supposed to help."
"Not proud but I own a pair of gunnars from long ago, never use the things"
"Just could t get used to the slightly yellow tint it gave everything,m. It did help with eye strain but I felt so goofy"
"i think that's exactly what she heard about.. i didn't know it was even a thing till last week.  I remember those filters that hung on, and attached to the huge hotbox monitors with velcro.  ACAD guy and i remember everyone in the office HAD to have one of those when they came out.  Never really had eye strain issues, have 20/13 vision, so Mom can fuck off with that ""you sit in front of that thing way too much, it's going to make you go blind"".  1/2 a lifetime in front of ""that thing"", look at me now ma! 😛"

"trying to finish up the first watch series today, got a whole heap of (warlock) arc ability/super to get thru.  I have stormdancer's, should i throw that on and just int mod the shit out of my build and solo queue nightfalls?"
So what you can actually do if you desire is load up one of the solo nightfalls or load in to a 950 and just do public events on the destination
"Dunno if The Corrupted is one of the three you can choose from, but it’s by far the best since you can go to the blind well"
"unfortunately no, but i'll just stay in the starting area for respawns and try to maintain sanity. Ty for the suggestion! I maxed out my int, if there's anything i'm not aware of that might help me out gear/location wise please let me know 😄"
Man there’s going to be some interesting stuff coming soon with this new post from bungie
where might i find this new post?
Trissin linked it above if it’s the one I think they are talking about
Oh no I think Oryx has Taken dmg. RIP
https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1192134753299750913
I’m really excited about this ngl all those hidden quotes in there sounds like they’re setting something big up

this is way too funny.
"Bungie: ""our true goal was to see who really doesn't have any resemblance of a life outside this game and we were thoroughly entertained with the results."""
Dungeon rewards aren’t pinnacle right? Just the weekly for finishing it? May as well get to the end on all three characters and finish it tomorrow for the +2?
"another day, another 8 love and deaths, another zero good rolls"
ahhh rip
"my ninth was full court, field prep, hard launch, velocity masterwork, and not spike"
there's that
"if it makes you feel better, i haven't gotten my first 150 spike until shadowkeep"
been using those warmind ones
keep praying to RNGsus lol
good luck with iron banner this week then
good way to get one
i'm not counting on that ahaha
i've gotten five swarms already. it had that fake spike looking perk 4/5 times
got me excited for no reason smh
Don't full court and spike buff different things? Full court buffing the explosion damage while spike buffs the impact damage?
Ideally you still want both
theoretically spike will buff your base impact dmg and full court will buff your explosion dmg.... if you're far enough
a spike with zero blast radius will still do less damage than a spike w/ full court and zero blast radius
"let me describe a brief interaction i just had with a titan:

- i pick up heavy ammo for black talon (need sword kills for bounty)
- opposing titan and i turn corner and come face to face
- i swing silly exotic metal stick, titan presses his almighty and unstoppable melee key
- both attacks land
- i die from bs titan melee and fizzle into arc energy
- chad titan walks away at full health and only missing the overshield he had thanks to OEM

for those of you who don't know, i really, *really*, ***REALLY***  hate titans"
You a warlock?
yup @Crizum
Yeah warlocks get shafted. If you had a hunter I was gonna suggest the arc battery build. I was able to tank a golden gun shot with it. That honestly felt dirtier than any time I’ve used OEM
I just wish warlocks could get into a melee fight and feel like they'll stand a chance.
handheld super nova is just super melee
I recently played on titan for a bit and the reliability of their punches are so much more noticeable.
It takes charge up and leads to trades when people know to keep their distance.
It's more like a short range fusion
D1 Titans has baby arms
lol wut
Haha you don’t remember the T-Rex Titan days?
"It wasn’t so much that they had baby arms I think, but warlocks had range and speed?"
"@Pentan as a warlock main/only i feel that pain on a personal level.  Keep your eyes out for that overshield and the fact that they like to run into your bullets, as soon as you see that charge put some distance between you, nade the ground, double jump backwards and unload a full clip of recluse in their face; whatever you can do... sometimes they get you, sometimes you get them"
"yeah warlocks could cross-map with their melees in D1, while titan melee seemed normal and actually balanced the 1-hit ability"
warlock melee was op tho
"my bad. lol, lemme explain some shit you know way more about than me"
"for a change of pace you could go momentum control and run jade rabbit, no one gets close to anything there"
"lol nah you good, i just didn't feel like replying because you're right and i hated the idea of acknowledging the fact that, to stand a chance against a titan that's just holding W, i have to immediately double jump, use my 1min cooldown grenade, and still pray that i come out on top"
I think the problem is the tuned melee way down overall and in Forsaken buffed the sprint melees titans have to make them worth the wind up but now we’re left with only one class that can one hit melee
i also feel that suppression grenades are definitely worth mentioning
"I might be lucky, but I don't get nailed by one punch titans as much as reddit/interwebs would have me believe.  I'm just a blueberry but I don't feel it's extremely unbalanced."
how long have you been playing?
since the start of Shadowkeep
oh you poor baby
"give it another couple months, you will be seething with hatred"
bout 20 hrs logged in various crucible things
"you'll be like completely calm, and then one tiny thing will set you over the top"
"you'll be sooo close to rationalizing it, thinking it's balanced, and then be swiftly reminded that there's a reason shaxx is a titan"
"it was pretty sweaty getting to 2100 at times, i think that's where i faced off against most OEM titans"
I will remind you that pre-forsaken Hunters were like 70+% of the playerbase. OEM just crystallizes and focuses hate on to Titans
"tbh i rolled with MIDA scout most of the time for that radar, and kept the fuck away.  I read up on a pretty lengthy pvp encyclopedia a guy made on reddit.  Started out by saying: stay alive.  dedicated a whole page to that one thing and then said ""go play 2 games, just focusing on surviving encounters, record your play, and evaluate.  rest of the guide was great too, but that bit of advice, alone, changed my W/L and gameplay dramatically"
weren't locks OP at one point too?
forsaken launch the new void subclass was broken AF
"Bottom tree striker is OP with the homing lunge heal and OEM but OEM doesn’t give overshield in super and they just removed the heal on super kill, meanwhile nobody is really raging at bottom tree Birdlock roaming all over town with giant flaming homing swords"
"lmao, true that."
"Stormtrance is not to be taken lightly either, not hard to go and melt an entire damn team."
Ticklefingers sneaks up on you for sure
turned quite a few games around with it 😉
I’ll also say arc bolt is nasty lol
"i have terrible luck with it, lucky if i get one chain lol.  everytime i get jumped by 3+ the damn thing is on cd"
"now i wanna pvp lol, sat down to put a dent in the last part of first watch"
"i think my fav part about ticklefingers is when that last guy on the opposing team, after watching me melt the rest of his team, being backed in a corner, desperately trying to  shoot at me as i close in, teleporting in a zigzag, ensuring his unavoidable fate.  So much drama in those little moments"
holy shit! had some 950 lunafaction boots with 63 total stat points waiting for me in the mail!? all i did today was farm arc ability kills and never started the damn nightfall.
"Love those random world drops, once you hit 950 prime engrams have a chance to be exotic"
They may always have a chance actually? Idk
"well shit yeah, that made my day 🙂"
They’re still very nice
"so that reload speed and range boost applies to anyone standing in my rift, not just me, yeah?"
"Correct, you’ll get some use out of those on Sunday cause they work in well of radiance as well"
my thoughts exactly
"oh, wait, so they proc in well automatically or do i throw down a rift in the well to boot?"
It counts well as a giant rift
that's pretty hawt
"so it'll do both reload and range at the same time too. dayum, and i didn't even have to use my AK"
anybody down for 9th branch run?
might want to save that for tomorrow
pinnacle drops get upgraded to +2 tomorrow
oh i thought it was today
thanks for the heads up
"ok, i feel like something is wrong. i've gotten the lunafaction boots, crown of tempests, a 2nd Nezarec's, and now an Arbalest tonight. Oprah joined bungie's dev team?"
"i bet it's fuckin telesto. they're going to roll back a day and i'm gonna lose all this wonderful shit and all my badge progress. I know a good thing when i see it, and i know when it's too good to be true"
and my GD enhanced bow mod...
And osprey for wayfarer
"i locked that one down, felt it was important but still don't know why"
"ahhh the badge, ok, warm fuzzies it is 🙂"
and now get away artist.. this can't be normal
lol what activities are you doing??
thats crazy
920 nightfalls for the badge completion
ohh wow i see
yeah I did hear nightfalls have a noticeably higher chance at exotics but damn lol
that's actually insane
hope they keep on coming!
"yeah, i kinda feel guilty right now lol"
bungie is handing out free exotics?
we take thosee
"abso damn lutely, just feel like i'm exploiting something here"
"first watch is complete, get away is squarely in my sights.. i'll get this undying title yet, even if it means being a zombie.  a very good night and i pass this exotic whatever the fuck it is to you 🙂"
ahahaha
"undying is quite the grind, for sure"
I need to get on that
"It's a really sweet title too, definitely sounds cool"
Is that going to be your first seal?
"i thought i had it down until i realized it required the badge, which required a whole nother level of dedication.  I have been getting at least one a day done but yeah, if you can stay ahead of that i'm sure you're gold"
"yeah, it'll pop my cherry"
"lol, damn ok"
"g'nite my friend, the pillow summons me"
"yeah, it's pretty late"
"would anyone want to do a master nightfall on monday night? know it's a bit early, but i'd like to do it after the GoS run since we'll get those +2 drops now."
Doing some Iron Banner now if anyone wants to join
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) if you haven’t already started on Randy’s try to get it done while Momentum Control is up for the scout rifle kills. That is honestly the longest grind. Also you’ll need that master nightfall ship so try to link up with @thegoaliebear. I’ll likely be able to be around to help and we should try to get you two divinity to make the master nightfall easier
sounds good👍
Izanagi’s is Fixanagi’d
~~Not Completly~~
<https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dt27rh/izanagi_black_armory_key_mold_account_bound_bug/>
"I think Ada-1 is cursed, poor girl"
Like log in the other character haha
At least it’s not hard locked? It’s like level 750 which is base level for guardians and if you swap weapons you’re above what you need for it. Sucks but it isn’t completely off the table
"@thegoaliebear absolutely want to do master nightfall! @Crizum yep, got Randy's (being one of those jade rabbit momentum humpers lol).  I still have a bit to go on exit strategy, gotta do master nightfall, and just a wee bit more with a fusion rifle in vex offensive, and some moon melee but i can see the light at the end of the tunnel now 🙂"
"also working on Izanagi's atm, luckily i didn't have to do the key mold over again even though i used it (when quest was bugged) and it just vanished without opening the box."
"oh, and I have divinity so if someone needs it and is on the raid step, i'm willing to let them have my spot on Sunday's raid since divinity completion is planned.  Just PM me and i'll drop so you can immediately sign up. (first come first serve)"
Oh no I just meant to have either you or goal with it haha
If goal has divinity and you finish Izanagi’s by nightfall time that makes it so much easier
"I know, i just know sign ups filled quick and want to make sure i'm not divinity blocking anyone 🙂"
"well, hopefully sunday I'll get divinity but it's really not a huge deal to me. I'm more about just getting all the +2 drops."
I'd rather you just keep your spot since you've done the raid before lol.
"I think everyone in the raid group for Sunday has, should make things way more manageable"
fair enough 🙂
"Besides, Revoker's better"
i got a couple misfits i can bring
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9q41SwDf2CU
I did use misfit to finish the auto rifle part of last season's Iron Banner quest
Honestly I would rather get waterboarded than use it again
"On Sunday we should do the one tether method, just finished the raid with it and it’s honestly way easier than two tethers and far less hectic"
Assuming three people have  normal/enhanced relay defender
i always have those mods on for the raid lol.
yeah same here
"People at first didn’t know how close they needed to be, so only two of us got the buff and we still did half it’s health in one phase, when everyone knew where to stand for the second dps phase he lasted all of five seconds"
what is it just do the first tether and then dps.
"Yeah, three people activate first tether to bring him down while everyone else hugs the other relay and does dps as soon as they can, other three join in instead of building second tether"
kk.
You don’t have to deal with the second tether being bugged or glitched
I have relay defender but not the enhanced version.  I like the sound of this strat 🙂
whats a good exotic to run with devour warlock?
Nezerac's sin for armor IMO
Contraverse or Nezarec's sin for sure
"Oh man, nezarec’s with double breach refractor on your chest and recluse"
i feel like i should be using devour more
It’s so fun
are you guys planning a garden run tonight want to get it done
"by the way, this clip with double seventh columns with jade rabbit is insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=141ussfDfj4"
My god those spawns
!gos
"Depending on when I can run it maybe @Spitfire2266, but Thursday I call destiny early at like 7 pst"
BREAD ACQUIRED
Ty!!
Nicely done!
"lfg 9th branch, @.me"
2070 Super is secured fam🔥
It's a good card! Great for VR as well
Plus you get to actually use RTX
now i get to have the fun of switching out the cards haha.
heyo! gratz @thegoaliebear hope it goes smooth and you're enjoying beautiful pixels soon
hah thanks i can't wait!
"Well, I’m stuck on the 2nd boss in Shattered Throne.  I started chasing down purifying a piece of dreaming gear for the buff mod but realized I can only get 1 (a week). I don’t see 5% damage increase making that bastard soloable for me.  Anyone else need to complete Shattered Throne run for izanagi’s or otherwise and want to team up?"
Oof the festival of the lost costume contest winners are out and every single one of them is amazing
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1192552896023252992
"agreed! Especially that momentum control, love it"
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) I can help you finish it up if you're still working towards it
"@Infernosi much appreciated, i got my 1 mod, woohoo 😉 when is a good time for you?"
In maybe 15-30 minutes?
"sounds like a plan, i'll be here and ty!"
"Looks like i WILL be getting Izanagi's today thanks to @Infernosi! made Shattered throne and the hardmode pyramidion parts of that quest a veritable cake walk, thanks again!"
Happy to give a helping hand! Do enjoy it on that 980 nightfall.
nice @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) !!! Sorry wasn't around to help out
"no worries 🙂 I still gotta heroic menagerie for the catalyst at some point, if anyone needs to do it too pm me and we'll get something going for it"

Is anyone else not seeing any drops from Altar of Sorrow?
Unless I'm somehow missing them or they're going straight to the postmaster
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) let's do the 980 NF on monday with Crizum if the time works out! would love to knock that out.
"so i am just making sure i have all the info right for when i get to install this bad boy:
-it says i need a 6 pin and 8 pin connector. i have the 8 pin on my 1660ti right now (the 6 pin +2), so essentially i would just shift that over to the 2070S and then plug in the extra 6 pin i have dangling there correct? (semi modular psu that 6 pin has just been chillin next to my gpu lol).

-i know i have to uninstall the 1660 drivers before swapping it out. so once i install the new 2070S i just turn on my PC, go to Nvidias site and download the 2070S drivers from there right?"
1. Yes
"2. Once you uninstall the old drivers, yea you can just install the new drivers through Geforce Experience"
okay perfect. thanks! seems simple enough. just a bit nervous since it's my first time making an upgrade. which is ironic since i built the thing😂
No problem! I understand the fear; I've built many Pcs and still get scared opening up my PC
and also...this thing is a UNIT.
thicc as hell.
NVIDIA knows how to make some c h o n k y cards
it is a very chonky boi. deadass like a burger.
We talking double quarter pounder or big mac?
double quarter pounder. the thicc patties.
but i can't wait haha. it's so beautiful😩
Beautiful cards lead to beautiful frames👌
I was really happy with how the 1660Ti handled D2. honestly the best mid range card on the market rn. but...i had the chance to upgrade.
and this guy at my school is deadass trading me these fancy ass Bose headphones for the 1660 haha.
Any sherpa raid run planned for this weekend?
we just have a raid tomorrow night. but i should be back to my apt today. I'd be down for a raid tonight. which one were you thinking?
"@thegoaliebear Monday is great, I’m flexible on times so whatever is best for y’all.  Have you performed the transplant yet?"
I'm gonna do it this evening when I'm back aha.
but monday evening I'm good any time from like 6:30 est onward.
@thegoaliebear I'm up for anything besides forsaken raid. Only raid I ran is Leviathan
i mean...eater of worlds is super fun and easy. do you not have forsaken?
"I don't, I missed it"
no worries. I'd be happy to do an Eater of Worlds run tonight if others are available. it's very quick and easy.
"Cool, I'm down"
what time is good for you? I'm free anytime after 8 est tonight.
"I might have some people who are interested in eater, you might remember Ryden and Hatless from the last run @Sarsante - 76561197967628966"
"And I think @RonInDune likes eater of worlds, maybe he can join up as well"
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @thegoaliebear is around ~8:15 a good start time tonight?
I will be bringing two others who have not done eater before
sounds good to me.
"So it might be a little bit longer than usual, but I don't think we'll have any problems"
Heck yeah Eater is great!
Especially since we have the 69+ completion specialist as well as the two person completion specialists with us
:o @thegoaliebear 69 completions of eater??
hahaha yeah Y1 was a dark time.
"I’m too impatient for solo flawless, looks like I need someone to run the dungeon with lol"
Doesn’t help that this place keeps randomly killing me via load screens or short falls o.O
The load screen bug does not disrupt flawless
"Idk about falling though, just gotta be safe I guess"
"I got it during the very first drop, didn’t seem like the same load screen bug?"
Just before I hit the floor it gave me the death screen and loaded me in front of the first rally point haha
Didn’t lose progress so it wasn’t a big deal
The transition between necropolis and tunnels after the doors?
"If it just kills you and you don't get ""your light fades away"" then it's not counted towards flawless"
No the very first darkness zone in necropolis
oh that's strange
are you dying like midair?
"It gave me the log he fades away, never seen it before so idk how it happened haha"
Because those falls will kill u
You know the first area with all the green glow in between the cracks on the ground?
Before necropolis
I hit the warlock brakes at a usually safe distance and just got “your light fades away” before I hit the ground
"wow, that's very weird yeah"
supposedly the fix for that is to change your FPS to 30
then change it back after you get past that area
I think that's a different area
But it doesn't hurt to try
Does that happen every single time?
"No, first and last time I’ve seen it haha"
Ou ok
"Then I guess, when it doesn't happen"
You've got a shot for flawless
you got this!
"Yeah it’s honestly just me getting impatient, I’ve never died directly to ogres in the pit but I’ve jumped off the same cliff like 4 times lol"
If I got stuck in a cave with 2 ogres covering both sides
I literally pulled out my phone and just waited
im also going for solo flawless
Yes @Buttkikker !!!
Glad to see so many people taking up these challenges now
furthest ive gotten is halfway through the chamber of suffering?
Ooh that's nearly there!
the one with the capture point
"The totem, right?"
What were u running?
Subclass & weapons wise
devour warlock
and im trying to remember my loadout
"I think it was izanagi, a tyranny of heaven, and 21%"
ooh interesting
"I'll be going for it too, eventually."
"ive swapped since to tranquility, le monarque and 21%"
That and Shattered Throne solo flawless.
^ 👊 props
"@Buttkikker I used Izanagi's, recluse, and 21%"
I just like the range and high damage of a bow recluse is so short ranged
"I’m using Izanagi’s/recluse/love and death, may swap love and death for 21%"
especially for the chamber of suffering
I think the main thing to recognize is that you don't have to be on that totem 24/7
The main reason for recluse is double breach refractor
It's actually pretty generous
You can roam around and seek cover from the fires and boomers
ill give recluse another try because i'd love to use izanagi
"Yeah, Izanagi's was super good for one shotting the orb knights"
And recluse is good because double breach refactor
"means more granades to eat, and more heavy ammo for delirium"
yeah it's always nice to have the nade up
try for solo flawless ST after pit! It's a bit of a different experience
I've confidence you can do them both
how is it difficulty wise compared to pit?
"Pit is glorified ad clear, imo"
ST is a bit more mechanics/boss oriented
Vorgeth I would say is the main obstacle
It's about watching your positioning and playing safe
And then the boss is a game of being aware of your surroundings
the biggest issue for me with ST is my lack of experience
so very changeable
Maybe read some guides or watch others I guess? But I think the best way to learn is to just try
Hahaha ohh nooo
Titan main on warlock. Did y’all know nova bomb kills you? That’s dumb
The knight stopped backing up and yolo’d in my face
daang
yeah itl do that
"Think for my sanity I’ll do a solo, then maybe a group run with no death, then focus on flawless for the emblem later"
welp im back in the chamber of suffering
any tips?
Find cover if you need to!
with recluse whats the best way to take out acolytes?
I leave the really far ones for the most part
If I feel threatened I'll eat a grenade and just use delirium
"as long as you have enough delirium ammo for the boomers, no need to save ammo"
Ooh wait it looks like my msg didn't send
With recluse I leave the totem and get in their faces lol
i used a double MG reseves for the flag and then swapped back to breach refractor     so i have 455 delerium ammo
ooh that's clever
Do you have hive armaments?
not 2.0 sadly
"That's okay, I don't have 2.0 either"
I used a few armor 1.0 pieces for armaments and barrier
"Always do the menagerie 3 times a week on every character, you can get hive armaments"
I really should do that too
And also run last wish and scourge
i did last week and ive done some this week
for last wish just do the free chest 3 times a week
i got armaments
I'm really down to every raid honestly
and nahkriin got spec and armaments
ooh by the way Ron is 7:15 CT a good time for you tonight?
Okay sweet we good
Good luck @Buttkikker !!!
is there a section in the geforce experience app that allows you to uninstall your current drivers?
eh I just use a DDU
"Use the DDU to uninstall, then shutdown, then put in the 2070 then start up adn reboot and geforce should handle the rest"
okay cool.
"and just to to be on the safe side, create a system restore point before starting"
i just never used DDU before and heard it's not really necessary so idk.
like which options should i have selected.
ah well you cna uninstall from the control panel then
i would probs be more comfortable with that haha.
yeah that works as well
so from control panel i just uninstall all my previous nvidia files for the game ready drivers and GFE correct?
just the graphics driver
so from this list. the one that says graphics driver 441 is all i need to take out?
sorry for all questions haha just want to make sure i'm doing this totally right 😂
"yup that's right, your system will go kinda weird right after as the motherboard display driver takes over"
It's all good
godspeed fam.
"nothing can possibly go wrong, you got this"
haha i hope. i read up last night and seems like gpu's are the easiest major piece to swap.
alright so drivers confirmed uninstalled. now just gotta shut it down and get to work lol.
yup good start!
updates to come haha.
@Trissin 8:15 CST?
"7:15 central, 8:15 eastern"
does that work for u?
alright...new GPU is in...Nvidia installing everything now. i. am. READY.
heck yeah!!
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966
my PSUs extra 6+2 pin was attached in such a potato way i had to open up the back of my PC and reroute the cable so both would fit😂
this GPU is a monster tho.
"It's an excellent card, very future proof"
"and i have to say...even tho it's noisier, having the side panel off of the case is quite aesthetically pleasing. especially when i booted it back up."
look very cyberpunk that way yeah
this card is large and in charge.
and it knows it too.
ok this nvidia is taking forever tho😂
"i got a pop up thing for a ""windows host process"" after i selected to do a clean install. one of those ""origin hard drive on this computer thing"". do i select yes? bc i selected no and it stopped the install😂"
i am such a noob.
"I'm not sure what that was honestly, can you get a screenshot?"
If you've gotten past it that's fine
or should i be okay without selecting clean install?
i can start it again and see if i get it.
nah always do clean install
avoids having the issue with multiple cards being left installed
oh wait nvm there it goes.
"@Trissin probably not, division 2 raid speedruns scheduled to start at 5:30 cst. Another clan took our 2nd place there."
that was weird. maybe it was windows trying to install its own driver? i saw that that can happen @RonInDune
yeah usually windows installs its own driver if given a choice
uh
_confuse_
it's the same nvidia driver
just without geforce experience
ah...all finished!
"I speedrun the division 2 raid, we had second best time in the world there. Some european dudes beat our time"
refreshing to see my.monitor go back to 144hz 😂
"Damn, thats crazy!"
I don't mind pushing back the start time
I'm sure the rest are okay too?
yeah i'm good
yeah i'm fine with whatever. i don't have anything tomorrow anyway so will probs be up late anyway.
Around when is good for you sarsante?
"Fun fact is one chinese clan also beat us doing the fastest run by a large margin but we think they cheated. Fastest team has 7:36, then 8:02 and my team has 8:04. So we will rry beat a sub 8 minutes run tonight"
"Idk for how long we will run. I would say find another player, I would hate to make yoou wait"
don't tell me that's 8 hours
"Nope, probably 4-6... Depends a lot when people tilt and give up lol"
"Ooh wait I missed the ""minutes"" part"
Mbmb
I misread what you wrote
hahaha here I was thinking division raid speedruns took upwards of 7 hours
"Okay, I think we'll find someone to fill in then, 4-6 hours might be a bit long of a wait"
next time! And good luck on your speedrun!
"Thanks, have fun"
"If somehow we stop early I'll let you know, but probably won't happen"
you know what still makes me the big angry
my solstice armor isnt a universal ornament >: (
@Destiny [PC] we have a spot open for an EoW run tonight if anyone wants a blast from the past.
Anybody in for a levi run? We're on Alpha
just need 1 more
"Just woke up from a nap but if either raid still needs some additional pew pew (albeit i've never ran levi or EoW, so i will need instruction) i'm down for some fun 🙂"
i believe there are a couple newbies in our EoW run as well. so would be happy to have you for that.
https://tenor.com/view/join-join-us-creepy-gif-5588625
we need a 6th for right now if ya wanna join
"hell yeah @thegoaliebear , OMW @1minatur"
is 8:15 est still a good time for people to do EoW?
That's like an hour and a half from now  right?
Yeah I'm good then
Okay cool getting kicked to orbit but coming back in doesn’t count for completing pit solo
bungo is true final boss
but you got it done solo! congrats!
solo flawless is not much harder
Honestly I’m just gonna do it on Titan lol
lol I feel that
as a titan main
warlock was not for me
Devour warlock is fun but I’m sure a modified Monte Carlo loadout will do just as much work
just main warlock lol
idk about that one
warlock is so op
Most of my boss dps came from anarchy and the weaken grenades
thats what I did too
"throw a nade, nova bomb, stick anarchy"
and just ignore the boss lol
reapply anarchy as needed
3 damage phases was more than enough
Thinking that with weapons of light
"I guess you dont really need to be a lock for the boss, yeah"
It’s apparently supposed to be done in one sitting
but for the totem
"Well, the totem would probably be the hardest part"
"yeah, that's the most difficult part of the run"
and I am not sure if I could do it without devour yet
I'd have to practice
You were planning to use monte carlo?
"You don’t have devour so it’s a bit iffy, but you do get rallying force"
"I dunno I’d need to think about it. The melee refresh is nice, plus marakov chain, it’s a lot of punching"
"Combine it with something silly like one eye mask, swapping to saint-14 when you use super, decent sustain but not as passive as devour"
Oh I didn't even think about OEM
Or maybe go with striker and skull fort?
those are all really interesting ideas
it might not be as bad as I'd thought
how yall doing with levi @Skurrj (Pork Steeple)
@thegoaliebear about to nut on flowers and bitten by dogs it sounds like
haha nice. jw because i don't mind starting EoW a little later if needed. want yall to get that clear.
ty ty 😄
moving to Calus now
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 ?
launching destiny
"Not entirely sure what's going on because I think we have a 6th, but he's currently in a Leviathan raid"
"We offered him the spot, so I think he'll get priority but it depends on how long he'll need to finish Calus"
np Trissin
btw I'm raid to ready whenever
the other way round actually
i can't english
"ok, Calus got slapped down by 6 mini-me's just need a 10 min break or so, brb"
Ping me when we're starting
alright are we starting
we;'re gonna quickly finish up our nightfall
"@Trissin don’t wanna say easier, but Titan felt right. That went way quicker"
"No flawless cause that wasn’t what I was aiming for, but I stayed ward of dawn the whole time . Didn’t miss devour as much as I thought I would"
"thanks again for helping out @thegoaliebear , @RonInDune and @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) ! had a great time :clan_discord:"
"@Trissin thank you as well and everyone else, I really enjoyed those raids 🙂 I think i did the typical male thing towards the end of that when @thegoaliebear was asking for the ball: assumed everything in front of me was adds and was looking at everything in the back of the fridge.  as soon as I died you were right there in plain sight 😛"
"btw, what is the website/add-on that allows me to transfer gear on the fly?"
https://app.destinyitemmanager.com
@RonInDune ty my dude
okay but like the temps on this 2070S are unreal. my 1660ti usually got 64-68C this thing didn't go over 50C last night. guess i gotta raise my D2 settings some more😩😂
i may be closer to 8:15ish for the raid tonight.
is there a second raid team going through tonight?
just that one.
"because I have two others with me and we cant find a team, wondering of there are 3 more willing to run. Its our first time through"
there's definitely enough who have done it before willing to help. depends on their availability. can always try setting up a post.
Ah would've loved to help out but I'm busy!
i would join but i have a stupid athlete meeting today.
When do the smart athletes meet??
we've met before there's like 4 of us.
"but it's like a ""plan for after college"" thing which will be a total waste of my time since i already know what i'm doing lol."
"@Yeti got some cleaning to do around the house and I’m kinda hungover but I signed up as an alternate, I’ll try to get stuff done within the hour to help out"
Canceling the raid post. plans have changed
@Crizum ^
"Saw that, I’ll keep an eye out if you post on in the future to help out"
"i'm free any night except tuesday this week, so i'd be down to help out."
@Buttkikker would you be willing/able to do this raid?
when is it?
8 est.
I'm not feeling d2 rn 😦 if you could make it I'd owe ya one
yeah id be down
thanks fam ❤ hope you guys have fun!
8:15 is better for me i still need to shower.
yeah that works for me too
we're starting 15 ish minutes from now yeah?
might be closer to 8:30 actually. sorry haha. still need to eat dinner.
shouldn't take that long tho.
lfg 9th branch. @me
i'll be there in like 5 mins. just setting up stream stuff.
@me if you need a backfill. i haven't done it yet though
@Destiny [PC] we have a spot for dungeon if anyone wants to do it?
I can hop on quick if you need
get in here
"sorry, i'm done with destiny for the night i think. just tryna chill before sleep for a while. thanks for the invite"

Could we get this pinned in #destiny-pve or #destiny-spoilers ?
"One of those ""you had to be there"" moments:"
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/506823072
microcenter has the 2700X on sale for $130. jesus...if i didn't just drop $500 I'd get that too😂
I'd also love to get a couple GoS runs going this week for my hunter and warlock. if people have days that work well for them lmk!
I'm actually pretty free today
"Never had an AMD CPU in my PC, always felt Intel was a superior chip temp wise and under load, but I’ve heard friends say in recent years that AMD has made great strides that rival, and in some cases surpass.  Have you (Goal and anyone else placing a larger demand on their CPU) found that to be true? My only experience with AMD chips was at work and in both cases IT replaced the towers with Intel because (apparently) AMD had a rough time doing what I needed it to do (simultaneous AutoCAD, 3D rendering, and large data transfer)."
I've found amd is geared towards multi core applications.
yes. i stream and game from my PC and I've never had any hiccups. the 8 cores/16 threads make it a no brainer.
Intel is strong for most single core activities like gaming
if you are solely gaming then Intel is *marginally* better.
"but if you are running multiple programs at once, AMD is the go-to."
I've always preferred amd
yeah i never even considered intel when building my PC. way too overpriced as well lol.
All the systems I've built have had amd
"Which is my case today, back in the day they went with the new dual and quad core intels (dating myself) when they replaced, so it’s been a good while. I still have my unlocked i7 but can see the need to upgrade in the somewhat near future."
"i just think for the price to performance you get with AMD cpus these days it really can't be beat. but again, if you really only game on your PC intel gives a bit more performance in that sense."
The first processor I ever used for a build was an Athlon xp dual core
but $130 for a 2700X is an unreal price haha...which is why i mentioned it
"Well I will overcome my habits and look at my needs with horse blinders off lol. Yeah that’s kinda what sparked my brain, that price seems crazy, like too good to be true"
That what I'm using and it was around 200 when I got it
unfortunately microcenter doesn't ship.
but if you have one reasonably close to you I'd definitely recommend giving them a look.
Definitely. I love going to microcenter
I got a new monitor on Saturday destiny looks so good on it
i can't be left alone in that store. first time i got all my PC parts. second time i came out with a new laptop. and most recently i walk out with a new gpu 😂 that store is dangerous as hell.
I’m guessing micro center similar to Fry’s? Like a electronics/PC Home Depot?
We have memory express where I am
Gratz on the new monitor 😄
yes but like 100x better @Skurrj (Pork Steeple)
"Yeah, I better not.  Like you said, those places are dangerous, and I’d leave all self control at the door."
literally me lmao.
"But babe, I NEED it!!"
you gotta.
I've been known to do that as well
"Ok, closest one is 660 miles away; kids college tuition is relatively safe, for now."
"Who am I kidding, unless colleges accept restaurant loyalty cards my kids will still be screwed"
hahaha. the one close to me is in Cleveland which is like a 3.5 hour drive. so i can use it as an excuse to go to microcenter and see a musical that's playing there...double trouble haha
"Please pass the chips and culture, that sounds like time well spent."
"Not a whole ton of that to be had here in Alabama, there are SOME things I miss about Cali."
I used to pass a micro center on the way to work everyday...pay days became rough for sure
"Ooof, can I just sign this paycheck over to you, or do I really have to involve my bank in this?"
"No microcenter anywhere near me, got a Fry’s though"
Would people be interested in 2-3 GoS runs tomorrow evening? We’ve got them down at a decent speed now and if people only have the one character we could rotate people in and out?
yeha I can do that
I have 3 characters ready anyway
my 3 character are fine would only have time for 2 runs tho.
I just have my warlock but I don't mind running multiple time
Warmind hates me
Warmind is mad at me but its whatever
bloody hell the robots are rebelling
"@Destiny [PC] Depending on how quick the clears are we'll try multiple runs. We have the boss down pretty well, think it was the quickest encounter last night"
If people figure out the extra pinnacle drop we can attempt it if it isn't too crazy
Also I wouldn't mind some more quick 3x scourge runs for anarchy
also xenophage is actual garbage???
why doesn't it crit!?!?
because bungo is meen
"Can I join the raid tomorrow? Or you're looking for experienced players? I'll run GoS first time tomorrow afternoon, so it would be my second run"
You’re good to join
holy cow congrats!!!
YASSSSS @Buttkikker JOIN THE CLUB!
I still need to run that
"Hell yeah, wtg @Buttkikker"
@Crizum extra pinnacle drop? Is that the 2nd chest at the end that’s encrypted?  I tried looking that up after the raid & dungeon but only came up with solo run chest exploit videos
"The challenge we did last night in the raid dropped an extra pinnacle reward for us, those challenges will cycle weekly"
"So I just mean if people figure out the second challenge tomorrow and it isn’t too bad we can try it, but I’m not going to hold up the run doing five attempts at it"
"Ah, gotcha.  Well how the hell does one get the access key to that other chest?"
"That was for Divinity, only dropped cause we did the puzzles"
👍 makes total sense now lol
i'm just in fireteam chat setting up my stream stuff. no rush. we'll take our time getting our loadouts set up!
"Sounds good, I’ll be on shortly"
I finally have my first pinacle weapon of the season
Thanks the gods for momentum control
Made me actual better player
nice! i believe for a few of us next week's undying mind kills are all we need for the title!
World's first Undying let's go!
I'll hand it to xenophage: it made getting Edgewise much much easier
Hahaha always looking on the bright side
"@Crizum @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) 
https://clips.twitch.tv/RamshackleWimpyGarlicDancingBaby"
All those drops though 🤣 what a reward
LOL i literally got the Osprey too it went to the postmaster hahaha
spent so much time on it. but so relieved we got it done.
How long did it take you?
1hr 20mins lol.
the saving grace at the boss is that if you wipe you don't have to kill the barrier knights at the start again and again.
oh my god i forgot reset moved back
Daylight savings time is evil
Yeah it really serves no purpose but way too many people want to keep it around
It’s proof that people just want to argue about stuff lol
"DST was slightly confusing for me to understand when I first came to the US, but my poor mum still doesn't get it. I understand its purpose, but I question its efficacy"
I'm not sure I really understand it's purpose - why do we do it?
"@thegoaliebear 😂 I’m not going to say it would be impossible if the 4 barrier nights had to be taken down again, but I’m pretty sure we’d have had to melee the boss down!"
I think it's to save power because sunset occurs over a long period of time in countries as wide as Canada or the US
To give us an “extra” hour of daylight
But it doesn’t make sense in an interconnected world
"Gets dark at like 4pm here anyway when winter hits, what difference does it make if it’s dark at 3"
"It’s also weird because Hawaii and Arizona for sure don’t follow it, and I think California doesn’t either"
"Oh cool I just looked it up, germans started it and we’ve only had it since Nixon"
bloody germans
"And yeah you were kinda right Ron, it was to conserve energy during wartime efforts"
And we all thought Nixon's biggest crime was Watergate.
"Originally daylight saving was proposed by Ben Franklin (as a friggen joke), but stayed alive and was first adopted by Germany in WWI as a means to stay “more productive” in daylight hours.  For various reasons, other countries began following suit, but generally the reasoning is “more productivity”."
"Huh, hey @RonInDune since you’re a lore/story person apparently the raid designer for guild wars 2 joined Bungie as narrative department manager"
Oooooh
Don’t YOU feel more productive now that we’ve fucked with your sleep patterns?  I’d like an estimate on the total number of hours humanity has wasted by changing all their clocks.
Having different time zones within the same country is complicated enough lol
America is too big
"Isn’t the old joke you could drive 7 hours and go across different countries in Europe, or you could drive 7 hours and still be in Texas"
We need Wyomingexit
"That is very true, Texas is just way too big"
Just push Florida away
"It’s like a 14 hour drive to see my father-in-law, and he’s one state away"
Florida has Disney Land! Non negotiable
What's the state where Fargo is set in?
All they have is snow
North Dakota?
"Yeah, merge the Dakotas"
"I’ve driven from Cali to Alabama several times now and I agree with that statement.  For some reason, New Mexico seems to drag on 3x longer than Texas on I-40.  Took me 28 hrs to get to Arkansas with only 3x 30 min naps."
Why aren't there that many trains here anyway?
I don't think I've seen a single passenger train here in Texas
Lack of trained engineers
We didn’t really heavily invest in them? Car culture is a big part of it
Or even a railroad track now that I think about it
"That's true, there's lots of cars here"
"In areas that have lots of public transportation issues we have stuff like bart/light rail/max which go throughout the big cities, and California was trying for awhile"
I joked that I saw more cars coming out of the Houston airport then I've seen in my entire life in India
But nobody wants to give up land
"Gotta say America tends to find one solution to a problem and stop there sometimes, we got planes why you also want trains?"
"And “we’ve given everyone electricity, I mean, it’s all tied together and vulnerable as hell, but you can cook hot pockets.  Unless you live in California, no hot pockets for you”"
Yeah we can’t contact my wife’s 90 year old grandparents right now cause they got their power shut off for the fire hazard
Because it’s easier to shut off power to avoid a lawsuit then spend any of the companies money on upgrading and fixing infrastructure
That's terrible!
They’re already $13B in the hole for damages so far.  It’s mainly due to faulty infrastructure that’s fallen into disrepair.  When those big winds hit (and they always do) the sparks go flying.  I don’t know how they’re going to fix such a huge problem.  Elec bills in Cali are sky high as it is.
"Water is an obvious issue too, L.A. was built in the middle of the damn desert and has it’s water coming from as far away as Arizona.  They ship their sewage to northern counties and pay them to handle it.  I love Cali, it’s beautiful, but the list of reasons I got the hell out and will never go back is very long.  Definitely worried for my friends and family there and wish they all would relocate out of state."
"Yeah we moved north, can’t get in to Canada so we settled on northern Oregon. It’s nice"
I've stayed in Davis for a few months and it's really beautiful but the forest fire warnings were wild
Northern Cali up through British Columbia is by far my favorite region of the country.  Had I not met my wife and moved to the south I would likely be in Oregon or Washington near my sis.
I mean the sex shops alone are a huge draw
I want to go whale watching in Washington state one day
Anyone who hasn’t been on the i5 is wondering what you’re talking about but I’m cracking up
"I know, it’s a very inside joke! I feel like you can’t go 10 miles without passing at least one though.
@RonInDune very good goal to have, it is a one of a kind experience.  Also, if you’re into seafood, Seattle has the best oysters you’ll find anywhere and the smoked salmon... oh boy, lox bagels... I miss them all"
I loved the seafood in SanFran but honestly it felt horribly overpriced
I'll keep that in mind if I go to Seattle!
"Oh San Fran is a dying beast, it’s depressing"
"San Fran is horribly overpriced, yes"
"@Crizum but hey, the city will give you clean needles and a place to stay when you wanna binge out on some heroin 👍"
Yeah it's strange to see a big city like SF to have such a homeless people problem
Isn’t that Seattle too?
I had panhandlers harassing me outside the Mozilla office
"Seattle is pretty bad too in places but I think SF has taken the crown there.  They seem to encourage homelessness in SF and have said all are welcome.  It’s not a black and white issue, but I feel that SF has enabled the homeless lifestyle to a point that, to some it’s a viable and enticing way to live.  People can make a decent chunk of money panhandling (sometimes much more than a 9-5), their drug use is pretty much encouraged, and there’s zero reason to do anything else."
"Eeps, didn’t mean to hijack the forum and rant so much. On a lighter note, we got some freezing rain here in northern AL last night.  If you squinted your eyes it almost looked like snow"
we currently have 5 inches of snow lmao.
In Florida ?!?!!
no lol.
Cuse.
i wish i was in FL.
Ah that makes more sense
but i still have to graduate. sadly stuck here until May💀
It's 40° F here in SE Texas and I'm absolutely freezing. I cannot deal with the cold lol
"Yeah I don’t miss living in places where several feet of snow exists all winter long..  but a little, every once in a blue moon, is pretty and enjoyable"
currently 25F feels like 5F tho
Lol @RonInDune I stick out like a sore thumb here.  I’m that guy that’s comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt when everyone else is 7-layers of fuck this shit
It was mid 70's yesterday afternoon and now in the high 30's low 40's here and it sucks.
I would literally never step outdoors if it were 5F jesus christ
oh that's not even the worst of it.
we'll start getting into the minuses pretty soon.
i think -45F with the wind chill was the coldest we got last winter
Are you lot descendants of the Abominable snowman or what
"Ooof, that’s when the wind cuts right through to your soul like an icy knife. Feel like your lungs ice over every time you inhale"
I went on the Mount Everest base camp trek twice and it was around 25F and I almost died
"Jesus, -45???! I can’t imagine how utterly impossible it would be to exist in that"
they usually cancels classes if it gets that cold.
"Like, damnit! MA!! The liquid nitrogen is frozen over again!"
"but we always, *always* still have practice bc our coach doesn't give a shit about us :)))"
I can handle hot weather way better than cold. I'm fine with 101 but you can shove sub 50's.
"Exactly, I have done days and days of fieldwork at >120F and I managed. I can't do cold at all"
Is your coach the evil principal from Matilda?
i will just put it this way - my experience with division one athletics is literally what made me decide to go to graduate school for a degree in counseling.
Well their loss is your gain
Ouch
i don't have a single friend that has enjoyed it lol.
misery loves company. we have great stories tho of all the shit we've been through 😂
That sounds kinda cruel
Very military boot camp-ish
very much. especially considering a lot of coaches genuinely do not give a shit about their player's mental health.
our coach literally makes us feel like it's our fault if we get injured 😂
i am looking forward to March more than you will ever know.
so i can be done with this haha.
and then i can have all the time i want to play Destiny! at least until grad school lolol.
"Solidarity, comrade!"
Grad school is way way more relaxed lol
but it'll be so nice. able to work out when i want and not have to be on our ridiculous schedule.
"That freedom does come at a price of always having to set your own targets, but it's always nice having people treat you as an adult"
I remember turning into a complete walrus during my first semester of grad school
i'm ready tbh haha. no more hockey to get in the way of literally everything.
"That reminds me, I've never seen an actual ice hockey match in a stadium. Wonder if Texas has any rinks"
Yes they do
Houston has a couple. 1 major sports rink and 1 or 2 minor
I went to a game when Houston still had a hockey team
also have an NHL team
in Dallas
Ok so the new challenge is pretty simple
Everyone just has to tether at the same time during the second encounter
so we wanna do that tonight yeah ?
"We can, it’ll just take some communication"
is this for every single time we have to tether to refresh our buffs?
that's just tedious as hell.
it doesn't have to be at the same place
just at the same time
"we'll call out when tethering, everyone lines up wherever they are, and then the anchors shoot at the same time"
"So basically three and floater would refresh at four, one and floated refresh at two with a countdown to tether?"
That sounds about correct
Sounds like the best way to do it is to all kinda gather by the tether box and then once everyone's tethered move to connect it
I'm going to be more toward 8:30. don't get out of class until 745.
Takes awhile for people to start gathering anyway so you should be fine
@Buttkikker relative of yours?
LMAOOOO
how tf is that not censored
long lost brother
Is it just you with a mustache? The evil twin?
who says im not evil?
HAHAHA
I'm dead
eating a whopper. should be on in 10-15 mins.
Eating a what?
Burger kings big mac
but better.
Ah ty ty
I’m just gonna chill in the tower so everyone can get the Hawthorne bounty
Haven't been to burger king yet
I feel attacked.
Burger King always makes me sick
"I’d rather do Carl’s Jr., or as you heathens call it Hardee’s"
if we have a particularly hard week at practice a whopper is my reward lmao.
wendy's is superior don't @ me
@thegoaliebear did you get a crown?
@Trissin wendy's has the best fries
things getting hot in the burger wars
i could honestly eat fast food burgers from anywhere. i attribute that to having our diets watched every second during the season lmao.
@RonInDune almost ready?
I'm running home right now
10 mins max
Kk
"@Crizum indeed, Carl's Jr., and BBQ is both a noun and a verb"
My power just went out
"Oh no, think you’ll be back?"
Not to likely. Whole neighborhood is blacked out
@Arixama want to join us?
My power is back
"Lol, was about to say if alternates weren' available and mugetsu's power didn't come back i might be able to fill in"
As soon as my connection is up I'll hop in
"^
any idea why it went out?"
No idea but it was at least 4 blocks
i saw the ping right after mugetsu's power came back. if you need me later im available
@Arixama you still wanna join? we are just doing divinity rn and then boss encounter.
"yeah, i can hop in in a minute"
@Destiny [PC] who would like to do a GoS run tonight? around 8pm EST.
I could
If there's a spot and I find a decent not too expensive screen I could
"Woke up with a dead screen, pretty weird"
Wife won't allow me to play in our tv at 8pm
I m down
"hey fam so recently i joined a gaming organization called Loyal Esports and I'm a streamer for them. it's a new team and we're growing and over the next few weeks we have our first recruitment challenge! i will be grabbing clips during my streams and posting them on Twitter. also, a lot of you tune into my streams and if i could get even more of you in there that would be awesome, so just keep a lookout in the #streaming channel for the going live notifs.💟"
@RonInDune @Crizum remember our tumblr convo the other night? i dug something up.
how do I unsee something
YOU CANT
SUFFER ETERNALLY
yall are my slutty squad.
y'all need some more incredible emoji pasta in your lives
I'm DEAD
i love those so much and I'm not afraid to admit it. they're just hilarious.
It's a truly incredible subreddit: ||https://www.reddit.com/r/emojipasta/||
i don't regret joining that sub at all.
Hate this raid almost as much as I hate what you posted
"Doing a run on warlock, getting the exact same drops I got last night"
its really stingy with loot
Got a hoard of swashbuckler/rapid hit hand cannons
"i have to drop from the raid tonight, sorry guys. i have a really long project section due tomorrow and i had no idea it was this fucking long lmao."
well good luck
"All good, best of luck!"
"i'm so fucking pissed about it. my prof assigned this and explained what to do the week i was out after i got my wisdom tooth out. so like, i'm already clueless as to what it should look like and i have to do fucking research too."
"so if you see me in a voice chat at like, midnight, it's just me crying lolol."
"Think I’m gonna drop out too. I just got four energy weapons in a row, which was already my highest slow, in addition to being trolled the whole way through the final boss with someone randomly popping cyclops and tethers"
ah well we can always run it tomorrow
for sure. we're not traveling this week so i got tomorrow evening and all of friday free.
I think you’ll still have 6 if skurjj and sarsante can make it
"I’m down, for sure! There is a very slight chance I may not be able to, but very good chance I’ll be on round that time"
If not y’all can call me ||marx’s 👀 little cum slut 💦||
"Just like Marx, I feel a bit *sick*le from reading that"
"lmao, the internets, cuz why the hell not?"
actualy i think ill drop out too
maybe we can set it up again for tomorrow evening if yall are free.
I'm down for tomorrow as well
senioritis is setting in so hard but i just have to really grind it out for another four weeks.
"Idk if I can make it tonight, waiting wife sleep to kidnap the tv to play. Tomorrow I'll probably have the screen issue sorted out"
no worries we had others drop as well. life and shit happens haha.
We cursed tonight's run with our bad memes
i love when windows doesn't even let me know i have an update ready so my laptop just freezes on me while I'm working on my project :))) this is why I'm a compulsive saver.
"No big, got a bit of Gambit left to wrap up 🙂"
I signed up for tomorrow’s but if there was someone signed up for tonight’s that will make it tomorrow I’ll move into the alt spot for you
"@thegoaliebear yep, I see you auto save, and I just don’t trust you’ve done your job well enough... ctrl+s"
oh no i meant compulsive saver as in i hit ctrl s after every letter i type lol.
I have everything I write (especially papers that are on the publication track) in a git repo and I compulsively commit like every few minutes
My github profile is complete mess due to that sadly
"I tell my students to the same, but every semester there's always a bunch of people who are unable to submit assignments due to save failures lol"
yeah i save everything i write as well. learned that from my mom haha. she still has her grad school statements that came very handy when i was writing mine lol.
Woah that's pretty cool
"well, i finished my project part lol. i have no idea if it's right tho 😂"
"depends, what level bullshitter are you?"
i said the same thing 5 different ways in a 6 page paper and got an A so...i'd say i'm a pretty advanced bullshitter.
then it's right 😉
hahaha. love it.
"Hmm, how do you get progress for killing Undying Mind in vex offensive?"
I'm guessing you need to do something special to spawn it?
"As of now, the Undying Mind isn't in the game, but he will be available starting next week"
Ohhhh ok
Is anyone down to help me through the Zero Hour mission? Turns out soloing it requires a Master's in skill
still one spot @Destiny [PC]
"I'll try get the recluse before the raid, it will help my ad clear. Missing 8 wins"
cool. it's fine if you don't have it there are plenty of things you can use.
"Im lacking void dmg for the shield, specially the harpy part. For final boss I want try riskrunner. I know they do void dmg but well there is the milk all over the place to keep the buff"
And yeah I'm a stubborn try hard
riskrunner is a good option I've seen lots of people use it at the boss.
"if you don't get recluse today honestly, Valakdyn might not be a bad choice for ads aha."
"Yea, Recluse's power is overstated. If you want some REAL firepower, I got just the gun for you"
the sound of misfit is so distinctive.
"It’s unmatched, *just like its power*"
I thought harpy shields were usually arc
Minotaurs have void shields
there really aren't a lot of shielded enemies in the raid. just the void minotaurs.
"@Peronix not sure if you’ve already gotten thru it but I need to complete it as well (tried soloing, nope).  If you want to team up, I’m available and we can do the damn thing 🙂"
Hell yeah!
"i will be full support tonight with my warlock, well, and divinity c:"
"hmm...i might actually look into getting emotes created that are like, cartoon versions of me lol. I'll keep the 3 bear emotes i have and add new ones from there."
"@LW Mugetsu it's to kill minotaurs faster, it was way too long of a battle imo"
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 you have divinity right?
Yeah you guys got it for me last run
"if you do, i would run that tonight and maybe use hammerhead in your heavy slot to take down the minotaurs fast."
yeah and with divinity you just use that during dps. just keep it firing at the boss for that damage multiplier bubble.
"Yep, I would suggest that because I've the lowest dps"
aha don't worry too much about that. but divinity helps a lot so it's a great support weapon.
this also gives me the opportunity to use Revoker/Darci 😩😩
Oh hey Halo MCC will be on PC from Dec 4th
That's pretty cool
It's just Halo Reach to start out with btw
Graviton Lance works well on void shields and if you can get a kill with mobs bunched together you get a pretty impressive fireworks show
Hey is anyone interested in doing time trial master nightmare hunts tonight?
What time? I’ve been wanting to get those done but I usually am off around 7 pm pacific
I should be on all day so whenever you are able to
I’m also down whenever we can find a third
Can be on whenever
I'll be on around 6:15 for my stream I'm down to try them before the raid.
So apparently Anarchy is due to get a drop rate buff soon
well thats nice
ouu interesting
it's not like it hasn't been a year or anything 🙄 😂
"Reach is gonna be on steam and Gamepass, wonder if they’ll have the same playerbase or if it’s split"
How good was the multiplayer in Reach? It wasn't as popular as 3 was it?
I remember it being divisive at the time due to armor abilities mainly
I remember Oathbreaker saying something about armour locks a long time ago
Armor lock was the bane of people’s existence
A lot of people use it to point towards some downward trajectory for Bungie in the pvp space
Oh Reach was still Bungie? Thought it was 343
Reach was passed to 343 later on in its life cycle
I don’t think it’s fair to say that at all though
Are there still people playing Reach on xbox today?
Or is it dead
They (Bungie) made some weird decisions about balancing back in the Reach era but it wasn't horrible.
The armor perks they added broke the mold they had built in Halo 2 &3
And not in a good way
"Mostly dead I would assume, you’ll probably still find a few people playing any game but most people went to 4 or more likely cod"
The people who went to 4 basically came back right away lol. 4 was COD with a Halo skin
5 was pretty good but at that point I was deep in to Destiny and didn’t hold on to my Xbox for long
"The general populace has moved on, Halo will never be what it was but I don’t think COD will be either? They’ll do big initial numbers but most people are on the battle royal train?"
If you enjoy the gunplay in Destiny you’ll likely enjoy what Reach has to offer
I wouldn't directly say that
But they're close enough that things will be familiar
I love the Destiny gun feel more than anything else so I'm down with that
The DMR is just a proto scout rifle
Weapon recoil is closer to destiny than the previous halo games
I liked what they tried to do with Invasion
I'm just excited for them to basically re-release the halos in chronological order on pc
I've not played Halo since Halo 2 back on Windows Vista so yeah I'm super hyped
The remastered 2 multiplayer was fun for a bit
I played the shit out of 5s multiplayrt
"I really enjoyed 5, hopefully Infinite is great. But honestly it’ll probably be like every other game I buy lately where I play for a few hours and get back on Destiny"
"Yeah, If there's a new game I want to play, I pretty much get it at release, no life it until I finish the campaign, and then never touch it again until like dlcs *sometimes*"
"I'm real excited for Star Wars  titanfall cause I'm not doing a lot in destiny right now, so it's the perfect weekend for it"
That game is apparently Sekiro with jedis
"we got official merch! more will be added in the future as well!
https://twitter.com/TzarGG/status/1195060330835132416?s=19"
I like the colours! Very unorthodox
Makes me think of SFV for some reason haha
i wish i had the cash to drop on one of those haha...but I'll just wait for the mousepad and/or shirt.
@Buttkikker would you be wanting to try all three time trials or just one? Crota seems to be the hardest but I have a pretty good idea on how to deal with him
"hell yeah, I like the look!"
as many as possible preferably
"Okay cool, we can knock out as many as we can before you all raid"
will be more toward 6:45 for me to get on. still have to eat.
Hey @Buttkikker wanna do the dungeon while we wait?
ye sure
if you have room for one more can i hop in on the dungeon?
Ok the Recluse nerf is pretty big I feel like
"And I""m curious to see how this affects One Eyed mask"
They kept tracking and health regen but removed overshield
And Xenophage will get a slight buff but I'm wondering if that's enough
Petition to change the perk name on OEM to “Shitty devour”
I'm yet to acquire that still
Crizum basically dragged me to getting *Xenophage* last week so I've been using it a lot
"I love it in MOmentum control, thing has no range drop off and is perfectly hitscan"
Lol I got to the boss and tried the encounter once
and noped outta there
Are the enemies 980?
Enemies 970 boss 980
I see
I'm not gonna try to solo it lol
especially with the annoying match game mechanic
At least it is t a darkness zone
OEM still OP
Wait what
It is a darkness zone
Isn't it in the tunnels?
If you finish the totem encounter it's no longer a darkness zone
Ohhhhhhhh I see
THat's how I tried soloing it
That probably makes it a little more manageable
OEM nerf ends in two ways
"People still get killed by them and complain that it isn’t enough, or people get killed by them and still complain it’s OP"
i'm just chillin in raid chat whenever people start filling in.
One more survival match and I'll join you in the chat
99% progression lol
that one eyed mask nerf made me shed a tear of joy
i would have liked the wall hacks to die too but ill take what i can get
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 we are just loaded into the raid no rush tho. hope you get the win.
let's finish that cp tomorrow evening. same time 8pm est. maybe the game will get its shit together by then lmao.
The game REALLY didn't want us to succeed.
whawhat happened?
"Glitches, lots and lots of glitches"
i bet they were bad too
"like every single bug you've known to happen on one run or another, just happened attempt after attempt."
a crap ton of shielded goblins spawning during the damage phase
uhhhhhhh
yeah. absolutely nothing that we could do but stand there and watch
did it lag you guys out or was it just  that you couldnt do any damage?
cuz of adds
They do spawn around that time so maybe a timing issue?
nah our timing was just fine.
but it happened multiple times
i did get weasel'd once as well.
the game could have been lagging on us perhaps.
anyone down to do a raid marathon over the weekend?
i got some quest i want to complete before next sport season starts
i'm not sure i'll have the time for a bunch of raids. i'm in GoS on sunday but i could probs do a couple raid saturday night.
Scourge! Scourge! Scourge!
"If I’m around sure, still wanna get those nightmare hunts done"
"lol, hope you get anarchy @RonInDune !!!"
Ron wait for the drop buff lol
do you have it @Buttkikker ?
Honestly by Bungie's timescale the buff might happen next year
Yeah that’s fair
i hope you guys get it
dont have any raid exotic
it's honestly so much fun
besides divinity
Anarchy is literally the only exotic I'm missing. I
I'm 138/139
i need to get divinity
"I need tarrabah, at 138 myself"
I wish I could my multiple Tarrabahs for one anarchy lol
20/132 baby
i would do scourge. honestly if we get the GoS cp done tomorrow i'll need a day off from that raid lol.
almost there...
xD
I think I'm cursed to never get Anarchy until @Thawxtem gets it
i'm in the same boat
I should run crown and try to get tarrabah
im always down for crown
hive armaments
my fav raid
I may try that tomorrow during the day
Yeah I want the one two punch shotgun
and hive armaments
i haven't done crown yet
im to broke to buy forsaken
my sport stuff cost me an arm and a leg
I still actually haven’t done spire
dont
its baaaaad
ive only done leviathan main
Spire is amazing!
Can’t I get like @Trissin to solo it for me?
so many people hate spire
wait hold on now
"""solo it for me"" lol"
Account recovvvvvv
I’m kidding
"we should take ya through spire @Crizum , its pretty fun"
"take me, take me"
tbh im not a fan of any of the y1 raids but levi base is tolerable
"Oh hey if we're doing spire I'm in, I love it"
"I’d like to, I want to clear out the backlog for prestige leviathan so I can get a quest slot back"
I did the opening section solo trillions of times to try and get the sleeper catalyst
I reaaaaaly need the catalysts from y1 raids
i have almost every other catalyst done
thats actually crazy
im still missing so many
i really want wardcliff catalyst but it's yet to drop for me
They drop pretty often with that clan perk
yeah?? i haven't noticed it doing anything tbh....
when did d2 come out 2016?
or was it 2017?
"grinded the hell out of strikes with ari and matos during solstice, didn't see any catalyst drops"
"the only catalysts i need to do are: sleeper, telesto, acrius, mida, and i have rat king but need others to finish it"
lol we can trade rat kings @Buttkikker
"I think 17, we’re in year 3 now"
w8ng for the sidearm meta
"i know you've already completed, but I think some people used rat king for tunnel encounter in pit"
for the invis lol
tho i did enjoy rat king in momentum control
well if people are doing some raids this weekend lmk. down to help out. but I'll definitely need to wait until sunday to do another Garden run haha.
im 100% down to do all of the raids in the game
yeah we have the beginnings of garden PTSD
i need something from all of them
Only thing I need from Y1 is acrius catalyst. Somehow that's never dropped for me
Wait that isn’t part of a quest? Why is it telling me to do prestige Levi?
for the ornament
and to get rid of the
GODDAMN
quest
Oh. Well I guess that’s nice
Better than most quests for the ornament
remember when it was in the heavy weapon area
“Give Tess money”
i remember that @Buttkikker
had to do it because it was literally taking a spot in your weapon inventory
it was the best
year 1 lol
"Finally the grind comes to 3 Undying Mind kills, and I am so happy to be saying that... bring it on, Undying 🙂"
very nice. we are going to have so many Undyings next week🔥
hoping the game decides to work tonight so we can get that check point done :)))
Fallen order is so good so far.
New star wars game
oh lol.
"also, if our group from last night wants to finish the checkpoint i can start early if others can. i have the entire day free so i can be on like any time."
I'm ready to lose my sanity anytime as well
i can get on as early as 3pm est. so whatever time is good for yall @Peronix @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @RonInDune @LW Mugetsu
@thegoaliebear 3pm works for me
Oh someone else can take my spot then if needed
I won't be on till around yesterday's time
OEM got nerfed
:zfgAnyway:
good riddance.
No sadness. Only joy
Don't get off work until 5
that's fine i have to go back to the fucking rink tonight anyway so 8pm is still good for me.
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) I'll be undying too next week... I'm still not finished with Death Stranding tho 😢
So many games to play right now
I'm available until 9pm to play destiny then I've division raid speed runs
that's fine. it's just the checkpoint so should be able to get it done within the hour.
*The Sanctified Mind heard that*
yeah now the game will be nothing but bugs and error codes lmao.
He's deleting our characters as we speak
"After the""vex milk"" discussion we had I think he would be justified in that action."
we only jinxed ourselves last night with the shit we talked about😂
He's guarding the *homie milk*
"btw, Xûr's selling mask of the quiet one and skull of dire ahamkara, both pretty handy"
"ALso, someone on reddit mathed out that both Misfit and Ether Doctor do more damage than Breakneck after getting a couple of rampage stacks"
https://redd.it/dwqihh
Rest in piece skull of dire ahamkara 😭
Hey it's not the worst exotic!
In a few cases it might even be better than Aeon Soul
maaaaaybe
poor thing
back when warlocks were anything but big buff circles
"I always jack that name up so bad, akamahra, ahmarkama,  akarbonara, amarkapolo... it’s terrible"
As if the best build currently isn’t double breach refractor recluse voidlock
"Ahamkara is actually a word in my native language, bengali"
অহঙ্কার
kinda sorta means pride
"Weirdly enough, a bunch of hive/taken names in the Dreaming City (and especially in the Shattered Throne) were bengali"
that's really cool
"Oh yeah, I remember you telling me about this in shattered throne"
Like the Knights
yup the knights are named after goats
Also Ron that post is depressing but also not surprising
That’s an interesting pick for a name for skull that you wear
fam...the Frozen 2 soundtrack is out.
it's so good.
Isn't the movie not out for another week?
Thankfully I'm 10000 miles away from any cousins so I don't have to listen to 'Let it go' being sung on repeat forever
yeah next Thursday.
"in pretty positive a major character dies as well. given the lyrics of the final character song by Anna, it's quite obvious."
God damn Gisney spoiling their own movie
Unrelated: anyone getting sword or shield?
unsure
From the Bungie store?
I got both
ohhh wait you mean Pokemon game sorry
ooh please let me know how it is
Ahahah all good ron
Giratina raid boss when?
"I'm just past the like beginning bit, but so far I like it."
I'm on the fence
the dex cut is huuuge for me
"^^
also ||no elite 4 hello???||"
??????
I'm sorry you had to find out like this
The last pokemon game I finished the campaign on was x/y I believe
i liked X/Y alot but sun/moon where meh
"I pretty much play them for the campaign and that's it, so my experience may not be super useful 😂"
also catching is like level locked??
strange
"I haven't notice anything being level locked, but I'm just about to go into the wild area"
Bloody hell reading these comments is like reading some abstract quantum mechanics paper
I'm also just being picky here but the music is a little disappointing
nah thats a big part of the games imo
Didn’t they remove the global trading center?
But there's like a new thing instead right
Y comm?
"hahaha i just spoiled myself on Frozen 2. in conclusion, i will be crying next thursday night."
They gotta kill someone major so when they comeback in Froz3n it’s a big deal
"they don't ""kill"" them. it's emo as hell tho."
lol didnt frozen 2 come out like 2 years ago?
all the reviews from the preview screenings have said that the mega fans will be happy with it. killing off a main character likely doesn't accomplish that.
not really up to date on my disney
no they had several shorts come out tho.
the actual sequel comes out next thursday.
ah that mustve been what i saw floating around
besides Elsa can't die. she's the immortal lesbian.
"Alright, I really don't want to have to mute this chat but I might have to if we keep going this way 😂"
:ricardomilos:
nah. i just have no desire to post in general chat lol.
"if ive learned anything the last couple weeks in the clan, #destiny-pc-lfg is the general chat 😛"
indeed.
Just keep the spoilers vague for me :BAha:
that's all i'm gonna say about it haha don't worry.
"like, i was gonna cry over the sequel no matter what. i've been waiting so damn long."
"See I'm of the opinion Frozen is just the stealth prequel to Ice Age, which was a stealth prequel to Happy Feet"
going to be on around 6:45ish just doing vex offensive stuff if people wanna join before the raid.
"so my coach has always had something against me bc i was a walk-on and ended up winning our program's first ever league championship last season, and he can't get over that. he's actively trying to make it so I'm not the starting goalie this season, but this is just too hilarious to me:"
"Holy cow, congrats! That's amazing!"
literally our only two wins so far this season have been my shutouts. but he's so set on pushing me out of the starting spot he's more willing to let the tean lose than to just play me😂😂
That's kinda toxic
last year i used to get upset over this shit but now it's just hysterical to me.
How are some people so *petty*
Hire a hitman
my entire team knows it too like they've literally asked me about it.
it's just so ridiculous.
holy shit bois is it finally happeing
||recluse and OEM nerf???||
||and xenophage buff???||
took long enough
"@thegoaliebear my wife’s professor in grad school was exactly like that, petty af.  Wife almost gave up on her masters because of it.  Honestly, It’s because these type of people will abuse any sort of real or perceived power they have in order to feel superior to someone they feel threatened by.  Glad you don’t have to deal with that shit much longer."
yeah that's exactly what it is. he never actually recruited me. my assistant coaches were the ones who really wanted me to come here. so he just never wanted to see me succeed lol.
jokes on him tho. i helped get him the only league title he's ever gotten in his 11 years here hahaha.
that's honestly pretty psychotic imo
oh he absolutely should not be coaching young women lmao.
"Lol, sick burn.  His moment of triumph is forever stained by your badassery"
"Very impressive on the shutouts and being ranked #2 in the nation, that’s awesome!"
@Peronix are you on mute lol.
So Destiny didn't win anything at the Game of the Year awards
"Shame, but expected"
"I got a new mic and it was working fine for one sentence, and now it won't activate"
honestly maybe try plugging it in again haha.
"Here's the winners, if people are interested"
@Peronix you’re such a good listener
That pc game of the year is fucking depressing
Nothing came out that was better than a 10 year old release?
"I've never played Warcraft, so I can't comment, but yeah some awkward choices out there"
"Honestly I'd put Outer Wilds/Disco Elysium/Baba is you ahead, but these lists are inherently subjective"
"some of my buddies are ALL about WoW classic, but that's a pretty niche audience. I agree, seems like a very odd game of the year"
Death Stranding maybe?
"Haha yeah, but it just came out so people won’t be able to vote for it"
"I deleted my statement cause it came off too dismissive of Days Gone and I haven’t played it to judge, just didn’t look all that great to me"
Death Stranding winning anything will cause mountains of salt though
"It looked like open world version of The Last of Us, starring the cast of Sons of Anarchy"
"Which is interesting, cause of a lot of goty awards just vote on whatever game appears to make them look the deepest"
I'm kinda sad Control didn't win more things though
"Still need to play that, I loved Alan wake and quantum break"
It's my clear GOTY and one of the best games I've ever played. I've been singing its praises here for a long time lol
@RonInDune @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 skurrj is just eating so will be a little bit.
not too long tho.
really odd question about garden of salvation...could it be done with three 1st timers in 2 hours?
is it mechanically hard like spire of stars or easier
possibly yes.
Depends on how quick you are at learning
"encounters are very easy but the boss is very involved and, like spire, requires everyone to be involved in the mechanics individually."
"The first three encounters should be easy enough assuming we have three people who have prior experience, can split the groups somewhat evenly"
Fourth one isn’t terrible but you gotta be quick on add clear
@thegoaliebear i need maybe 10 minutes
that's fine.
"forgot there was an Overwatch tourney at 3pm on Sunday thought it was on Saturday its not mandatory that i make it, but it would be nice if i could....ill watch a lot of tutorials on it."
for sure watching a video is very helpful to get a general idea of what's going on.
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 we are all here. just need you.
If anyone's awake and wants to help us with the Xenophage boss real quick lmk.
"oh shit, I need to do that"
I might join up
"Do it, this boss sucks."
we're in ft alpha
Thanks again Trissin
"lol ofc, np at all
thanks to you guys as well"
Anyone still need or want help me to get 100k in nightfall? I never did 950 it's pretty hard with randoms
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 i can do one tonight if we get a third.
Thanks @thegoaliebear
for sure. I'm streaming around 7 so i can do any time after then. if 8 est works tonight I'm good with that.
I’m down for a 100k run as well @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 if you still need a third
950 will be easy enough with all three.
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @Peronix is 8 est good for you guys tonight?
Ye
it should be
sweet. i'm fine starting a little later if needed too.
so i just figured out that since i bought a 2070 super that card is included in the ones you get modern warfare for free😂
i just never use the geforce experience app aside from updates so it's just in my library waiting to be redeemed.
Geforce experience is actually sometime pretty helpful
"I initially couldn't get Destiny to run at all for months, then I used the GE optimizer tool thing and it started running"
well...i will have to download MW tonight then aha.
"best show. 
https://twitter.com/andergalagher/status/1195317793933189120?s=19"
Just watched that episode with my wife  haha
ahaha it's such a good show.
@Buttkikker want to attempt the 980 hunts again at some point today?
@Crizum definitely I should be on most of the day so whenever works for you
"I’m around all day so whenever we get a third, if anyone is interested"
*you rang?*
Sure let’s go
Crota just cheesed us
hey anyone down for running a dungeon
"Mostly for the lore, but the loot is nice too"
after we do nightmare hunts id love to grab the lore
plus every chance i get for the ship is great too
"perfect, ty"
I'll be in orbit when you're done
I'm down as well
@RonInDune i'm good to run the dungeon
alright I'm logging in
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xnWWC108R4||
Ok the Inquisition of the Damned lore ending is actually awesome
I wonder who wrote it IRL
i need to study the lore so i can find more gay ships that i can cry over bc they're all dead.
there's not enough Ana/Camrin content out there for me to be satisfied.
whos camrin
There's always Devrim Kay and Marc
Ana Bray's gf.
She's in the comics
This one: https://comics.bungie.net/en/5/warmind-3
@Peronix @thegoaliebear I'm sorry I won't make it. Division 2 speed runs will take more than I anticipated
We had the run we wanted but we screwed it up
"Our goal is a sub 8 minutes run, we were 6 seconds faster than that but we lost time"
is there a garden run today?
I'm down if needed
not one planned. but i'd be down for a run.
It's so hard to play 2 coop games... I want speed run division and play with y'all. Im enjoying more destiny than division
well i am getting on now if anyone would like to do a 100k nightfall.
Right now I can
@Destiny [PC] anyone else for a 100k NF now?
I think my mic is working now so I'm down
"nice, im launching the game"
is this weeks easy to 100k?
can be done on 950
what's a good loadout ? Like what did you use
"i feel like mine is crap, izanagi + recluse + wendingo with disruptor grenade + antibarrier smg"
that's a fine loadout. just need arc for the harpy shield
brother and I about to run a 100k. join?
ill join you guys if you want @flipd
Anybody feel like running a raid? Doesn’t matter which one lol
Maybe crown?
Or scourge if @RonInDune is interested
i'd be cool with a scourge run.
ooh i kinda want to do crown
FIGHT
2.0 armaments
"Popped in raid chat, if we can get at least 2 more I think we could even do guided games, if anyone does those anymore"
"I know it's a bit late, anything going down?"
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do a raid tonight? I'd like to do Garden for my titan but I'm cool with crown or scourge too.
I’m down for any raid tbh
"I'm down for non forsaken raids, because I dont have it"
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tonight. I'd like to do a Garden run for my titan but i am good doing any raid tbh if there's one someone really wants to do.
have to do school work today so can't make that one sorry.
if there's any chance yall can start later i could do it.
mind if I join the 8pm then?
the others wont be able to make it
at the later time
@Yeti of course. all of us in that run have done it before so it'll be pretty quick just taking ya through!
"I have all the steps of the divinity quest completed, do you thjnk we could grab that? or is this a speed run"
it's fine we can do it. doesn't take long anyway.
alrighty
it will be entertaining do all the jumping as warlock or titan... you guys will need to pull me every single time lol
i haven't played on my titan in forever lol. will be interesting.
anyone down for a garden run?
can I get an add from the team leader tonight
"yeah, what's your steam"
you want the tag or the friend code?
friend code is fine.
162259947
sent.
"got it, ty"
"I've some concerns, @Peronix"
Just noticed the new name lol
I have my talents
That discussion wasn't supposed to leave the raid
*sigh*
At least he didn't change it to something involving an anime that was being talked about
You can’t say that and not name the anime
there are a few suspects on my mind already
but I'm not sure I want to know
Hi
"It was "" That time I got reincarnated as a slime"""
Let your imaginations go wild
That’s mega tame I’m imagining way worse
It makes me laugh so I was playing it in the background while raiding
"I have much more ""interesting"" anime that I could have been watching"
You can just say hentai
We all have our weird ones
Azure Lane?
I would say ecchi not quite hentai
Azure lane is tame
"alright unrelated to all this anime talk, anybody know of a way to split audio outputs?"
splitting it in media form or from a source?
"like have sound for one application going to like a monitor, and then sound for another app going to headset"
hmmm
not that I'm aware of
maybe an app of some kind exists for that express purpose?
"@Arixama if it's a headset with it's own drivers you can go into sound devices in windows, set your headset to default communication device, and set your monitor speakers as the default device.  I do this so only game sound/music come out of my speakers but discord audio is strictly over my headset.  Is this the type of setup you're wanting?"
"No actually, I have that set up. Wanted to have game audio through headset and then the twitch app audio through speakers @Skurrj (Pork Steeple)"
brb raid team
looks like there are definitely some 3rd party audio managers that will do precisely what you're wanting to do.  I found and read thru a bit of a guy's solution to your problem and it looks legit and he seems to know very much what he's talking about.
https://johanbak.com/2018/09/05/take-control-of-your-twitch-stream-audio-a-setup-guide/
seems pretty damn involved and there's probably a better/more up to date solution.  Maybe try searching out some twitch/audio forums and find someone who's all about it.  When i was learning how to overclock i got a few mentors in forums and it's really nice to have knowledgeable friends who can help you with very specific issues you encounter.
"next up: my journey to max rank in crucible using only better devils, uriel's gift, and sins of the past"
@Destiny [PC] if anyone wants to do a raid or something tonight lmk. I'll just be on chillin so I'm down for whatever.
"Idk, I might be available until 9pm ET. Division folks might want run at 9:15"
"But I'm having more fun playing destiny tbh, might quit division until next raid in 2020. Idk mixed feelings atm"
I'm available at least until wednesday to do whatever
Would y'all be down doing Last Wish tonight?
I'm down for last wish
yeah i can.
What time works best for y'all? I'm available anytime
like 8 is good. if we can just make sure everyone else is pretty experienced with it i would prefer that bc that raid can take a while lol.
you've never done it before right? @Peronix
"I haven't, only watched guides on how to do it"
okay.
@Destiny [PC] ^^ LW run tonight. Peronix' first time through so please join only if you've done it a bunch.
must be rivensbane and have 30+ clears
if you don't have not forgotten or anarchy don't even think about joining
must have gone at least 20+ clears without getting 1KV.
If your recluse does not have over 70k enemies defeated you will be kicked
hahaha. but for real it's just one of those raids that can easy drag on if one person doesn't get it lol. the 1KV chase absolutely ruined this raid for me so I'd prefer To...not spend more time in it than necessary💀😂
emo times haha.
yall gonna try and do LW the legit way or cheese it
I'm not sure how the cheese is now since all the weapon changes and whatnot. if it still works then obviously would prefer to do it that way aha.
grenade launchers still wreck face I think
we will probably all have a 200+ light advantage on the raid still
Enhanced grenade launcher loader will probably be important
If GL's still work ill sign up for an Alt
Also could I get an add to the PC clan so I can get the Clan Night triumph
missed it on GoS last night
i don't see a request.
https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2/AdminSections?groupid=2840602
the mobile app hasn't worked at all for me since the last update.
"ah, I forgot to leave the PS4 clan first"
should work now
okay you're good.
"Not me, but a friend:"
https://gfycat.com/thisjollybream
This was a couple weeks ago
"You can definitely still melt riven, lol"
wat that HP went from 90% to all the way down in an instant
Went from this:
"so well, bubble, and GLs slap."
to this:
"@Destiny [PC] I'm also serious about all arc titans at a later date, maybe sunday?"
missile the boss
6 missile the boss :taffyThink:
"yeah thats the plan, get a kill with 6 code of the missile supers and send it in as MOTW"
Add some anime music and quick cuts
"Sunday wont work for me unless its early AM (like 8 or so PST), but if you guys end up moving to friday evening im down"
I'm away Thursday-Sunday evening. F2 thursday night then away for games.
"If people want I can adjust it, move the warlock run to tomorrow or wednesday and titan to friday"
i will be completely from late Thursday through the weekend
yeah i can do a run tomorrow and wednesday as well.
Or I could just make Titan time tomorrow if you're around @Gimmie2
"I'm down for an all titan run, lmk when"
@Crizum what time tomorrow? i dont get home from work until ~5:30 PM PST
I'm down for a titan run whenever
but after that im down
probably like 6/6:30 pm usually
tomorrow I'm not available until like 9:15 EST. so I'm fine skipping out on a run if time doesn't work out can always do another one some time.
6:30 would be about 9:30 your time if you're okay starting around then?
that should be fine.
im comfortable bringing a tractor or divinity for damage amp as well
"also tomorrow, i go to our esports room in between classes so if anyone wants to see what the Undying Mind is about at 2pm EST and grab that juicy Undying title lmk!"
"Anyone want to do 950 NF, 950 Nightmare Hunts or Pit at some point today?"
"I'll be on about an hour before the raid, 7pm est. so i can do a nightfall."
"Cool, thanks Goalie"
btw is anyone trying Stadia?
i don't understand this meme
Oh but Trissin will
"So far from what I’m seeing it’s still very much a beta or even alpha product. Red Dead Redemption 2 for instance runs worse than the Xbox one x version, Destiny 2 does run at 60 FPS with some bad input lag when using mouse and keyboard, and it’s running at 1080 upscaled to 4K on pc medium settings"
"Honestly, streaming with destiny isn't awful if they do it right. There was a solid 3 months I was without an actual gaming pc that I used a service the connected my *at least* 7 year old laptop to a remote rig."
My system only has a 1060 but even that runs at 60+ FPS on high/max
I've played Assassin's Creed Odyssey during the trial last year and it felt really impressive
But FPSs are a different beast
The important part is actually having bandwidth settings so you can control your upload speed
Plus looking at the list of prices it’s not good
Full price for tomb raider when it was like 5 bucks a little while back?
Also Google is notorious for shutting down products randomly
"no interest in stadia, didnt spend all the money on my PC build for nothing"
RIP google reader
"And yeah that, being google I don’t trust them to do anything but use it to display targeted ads"
"Project xCloud, if they can get it up to snuff, seems a much better proposition"
I'll wait to see if Microsoft or Apple or someone like that brings a really polished version of this in 3 years
"Since it streams whatever you already own, and works with Gamepass"
Or maybe valve comes out of nowhere with a streaming service and rules everything
sadly I don't think Valve is the innovator they used to be anymore
"If you're really looking to stream your games, I'd suggest looking into shadow. It's a little bit more spend, but you don't have to rebuy your games."
@Crizum have yet to see that meme format.  I knew nothing of Stadia but that picture is worth a thousand words lol
just kidding lol.
I think warmind has gone rogue
those are some large spectacles
like...deadass.
warmind bot is just not having a day rn.
He’s just grabbing a snack
hey bots are people too
Turns out Warmind *is* the Undying Mind
And Ikora is Savathûn
Does that mean Zavala is Xivu Arath?
No Zavala is Chuck Norris
*INDEED*
Kadi 55-30 is Xivu Arath
That's why she can go into the most dangerous locations ever and bring back our engrams
@thegoaliebear I *intend* to already have the title but even if i do im totally down to demolish the undying mind with you
awesome. i cant imagine it'll be anything too hard aha.
the only reason i would expect it to be hard is if its an activity without matchmaking that needs multiple people
I still need the master nf but god is it so hard
this week's isn't so terrible.
"Saw that we can set backgrounds on Twitch so I had a lil fun making one.  Used to do this for members of the SWTOR clan I ran for forum sigs etc.  I enjoy it, not the greatest, but if anyone has need of some fun Destiny 2 images for whatever reason let me know 🙂"
"LMAO, i found my old sig... man i thought i was sooo cool with Photoshop 4, you can't hardly see my damn assassin!"
I'm sorry but I'll be 15 ish minutes late. Yeti can take my place if needed
Beauty
if this weeks master nf is considered 'not that bad'
"then i suck hard at this game, lol"
Just getting into the main entrance is hard as hell with the no health regen
OH NO @Crizum
omfg
not like this
this helm
nice emblem
https://media.tenor.com/images/001c6502f1320fc714b6dbbee15fbdba/tenor.gif
https://twitter.com/WVMN00/status/1186136623550844928
oh i like that.
I love that account's fanart
https://twitter.com/WVMN00/status/1194180079560953856/photo/1
Just be wary they retweet very NSFW Destiny stuff sometimes
ooof D2 on stadia looks rough
I can never see stadia the same way again thanks to crizum
"It works slightly better on mobile, so @Arixama should be pleased"
https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584
Atleast we finally get Half Life 3
@RonInDune if you are going to get a scourge run together save me a spot.
depending on day i'm definitely down.
A chance to be disappointed when Anarchy doesn’t drop? Count me in
we need to do some sort of ritual sacrifice to get it to drop
I hear those are foolproof
"okay so things here have been getting worse. we've has 10 racist/anti-semestic incidents over the course of the week and now we have a ""manifesto"". real or not it's obviously being taken seriously so much that the FBI are notified now and we don't know if anything was specifically targeted for the university."
that being said i will not be going to campus today so at weekly reset let me know who wants to get the Undying title with me. lol.
Let's do get that title. Also WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE
for sure i'm looking forward to something good to take my mind off the shit going on here.
"I'm really glad our games this weekend are away. as much as i hate the traveling, it'll be good to get away for a few days."
It's almost Thanksgiving too. Do yall get time off for that?
for once yes lol. we play the tuesday of that week but have a lift.wednesday morning and then we're off until monday when classes start back.
Siiiick
That type of shit is not ok in the slightest and I hope they find out who is doing that shit and send them packing.
i *LOVE* watching people unload their heavy weapons at immune enemies!
"it's great, isn't it?"
I'm grabbing lunch rn but should be on around 12:45. let's get that title!
oh hey the undying mind music absolutely slaps
tip: bring divinity
@ me with Revoker divinity DARCI
"undying mind, more like A FUCKING WEAK ASS BITCH"
"i cant die any more, that the rules"
so the raid challenge is deposit 10 motes everytime
Congrats to our new undying members!! And those soon to get it :))
"Oh snap, forgot to post a SS, um ditto to what Goal’s looks like 😁"
@Buttkikker this isn't censored
We're on weird names now?
idk why I feel the urge to ping @Peronix
honestly i respect that a lot.
Idk how tf that isn't censored
and buttkikker is
They’re putting chemicals in the vex milk and turning the friggen constructs gay!
that's the gay agenda in action
they're being gay and doing crimes
At some point this week do people want to do the master nightmare time trials? Shouldn’t be half as bad as Crota
this undying mind bullshit is such a letdown dude
Wow yeah lol just one phased it ez
yeah we one-phased several times haha. it was fun tho.
btw does anyone want to do Niobe labs one of these days?
I still haven't completed it
dosnt that give a ghost shell?
Oh yeah same lol
yeah and an emblem
I’d be down to try again
I tried it a bunch of times and have always failed on step 7
im completely inexperienced lol
Don't worry it's very simple and straightforward
I feel like we were super close that one time
yeah maybe now with better weapons we can do it
I would also be interested honestly
"Also, The Game Awards nominees are out"
doing undying mind is taking 3 phases with this group
Destiny got nominated for Community Support and Online Game
Vote here: https://thegameawards.com/nominees
The Indie game field this year is incredible
Man that game of the year field is stacked
Anything but smash could win and I’d be happy
hard to choose between Gris/Disco Elysium/Untitled Goose Game/Slay the Spire for indie as well
I'm a straight ticket voter for Control so it's an easy choice lol
"Just finished death stranding last night, it was great"
I'll have to wait for a year till it comes to PC but I'm super hyped anyway
I’m only in chapter 5 of death stranding  it’s amazing
"It only gets better from that point, MGS had a habit of getting harder to understand the twists and turns but that wasn’t the case for me here"
Chapter 4 was insane
Can’t even discuss my favorite parts lol
Control was amazing too
Sekiro is game of the year so far but death stranding has a great chance to take that spot
All of this makes me wish Shadowkeep was better
And Anthem sadly sank like the Titanic
"I’m enjoying shadowkeep, but constantly updated live service games have a harder time reaching the levels of games that have a tighter focus on story"
Apparently undying mind is meh
Feelsbad
They could sink tons of money in the story but what comes next
"Forsaken was so good, everything since Black Armoury feels like a slow downward spiral"
Atleast the raids and the lore is still good
"And yeah, when Ghost says “there are still undying minds out there, we have work to do”"
After the third kill?
"okay fam i was here thinking this buzzing noise was like, super obvious and distracting lol. re-watching stream now it's not bad at all. i think it is coming from my mic and does seem to be when it's at very specific angles lol."
I'm sorry for making it sound worse than it is!
hahaha no worries. it's been a thing for a while and i don't think i can fix it ? it definitely only happens if maybe the mic is titled a certain way or something.
but as long as it's not...constant or obnoxious it's okay aha.
"i may just get a dedicated mic. i know the basic Yeti mics aren't too expensive. but this has been working just fine for the time being aha. i was just worried it was like, sounding really bad and distracting 😂"
oh man what a let down. I was so hyped for the final assault. Now I just feel dumb.
haha. i think it's fun melting bosses like we did.
i'm just happy to have a new title.
I already did that like 100 times already..
The engine that Bungie uses must have severe limitation in what you can do with bosses..
at least put some interesting modifier on the boss
...just something please....
to be fair tho...there are a lot of people who will never have Undying. in the grand scheme of the population only a small percentage actually will complete the title.
so they can make vex offensive super easy.
cuz most people SUCC
I don't mind it being easy.... is just that boss itself was a let down
I wanted something spicy
we are not like them casuals😂
haha true
but i agree. a different mechanic would have been nice.
i mean if you for example would have put any monster modifier from diablo 3 on the boss I would have been satisfied
Imagin a boss that shoot lighting when you shoot it
just reuse the lightning animation from the vex portals
yeah. checked Braytech.org and based on the triumphs of tracked players only 1.81% could have the title since the collections badge is the lowest percentage aha. our clan is probably that 1.8%😂😂😂
"Yea, Randy's probably kept most of the playerbase from the title"
They are trying to find a middle ground between hardcore and mid core/casual
So anyone who doesn't have undying = ban? thats what youre saying
"Like the 980 nightfalls tend to have interesting modifiers added, the master hunts etc, and for all our raid clearing only a low percentage of players complete it"
Would have liked to see something aside from just taking a boss model from D1 and putting it in the vex offensive but I get it haha
Clan membership requirements are now Gjallarhorn/Solo Crota/Petra's Run/Anarchy/1KV within 3 complettions
"@Crizum Yeah sure but even nightfalls and monster hunt have ""boring"" modifiers compared to other games"
"There *might* be more things down the line, but Season of the Undying really suffered being tagged alongside Shadowkeep"
Yeah it probably get a lot poeple worried about season pass
I blame the stadia
guys its time to leave pc.... lets go stadia
300 ms delay
some of the videos I saw was just awful
i think Undying does have a good balance between easy challenges you can just get done and more hardcore stuff. Randys just made it awful becauss it was so disproportionately balanced compared.
"like the raids, the master nightfall is something majority of players will never do."
They went independent while launching on steam while working on a stadia version while most of Bungie is probably on D3 and whatever the net ease thing is
Atleast nothing is RNG
Oni remastered let's go
"@thegoaliebear I disagree about Randy, I feel like the quest actually made you better at using scout rifles. IF you include that as a reward then the quest is fine."
"No it’s Destiny Legends, a gacha based card game with all the names you may have read on a grimoire card once"
"Master Rahool is the dealer, of course"
Actually they should bring back Myth and make Myth 3
That was such a good game
Destiny Battlegrounds Mobile
"Or maybe Marathon, but I never played that cause literally noone in India owned a Mac lol"
nah Randys was poorly balanced haha. we just don't care bc we play enough to get through it anyway.
Randy's will get the Mountaintop treatment two seasons down the line
but for majority of playerbase that and master nightfall are the intimidating factors.
oh for sure those objectives will get tuned down.
"I don't get why everything has to be so casual friendly. Look at classic wow, its hardcore as **** and people still play that"
because of new light mostly
"The move from three seasons to four would indicate to me that we’ll be getting more bits of smaller content so there is always something coming up, instead of hard and grindy content meant to last"
Also nostalgia is why people play classic wow haha
like crizum said they are definitely trying to find a balance. but I think they will always lean toward the more the hardcore player base. titles were never meant for casuals. but there's still enough triumphd they can get within the titles.
"Wish Randy was actually a character in the game though, he sounds absolutely hilarious"
In lore wasn’t he on Redrix’s team in crucible and he shot at Shaxx?
he was basically Leroy Jenkins
He’s the canon blueberry
IS redrix dead?
No I don't think so. Redrix was chums with the Drifter
He lives apparently according to wiki
the game of the year nominations are suprising
didnt think control would pull so many nominations and i thought kingdom hearts 3 would do better
"So... noob question, there is a way to enquire the bot about raids I signed up? I think there is one tonight but I can't recall"
"I've heard more complaints than praise for KH3 so that was slightly expected, I'm more surprised DMC V and the new Fire Emblem game didn't make it"
Ooh crap I still need Randy's
Is momentum control still on?
I completely forgot about the collections requirement
Unfortunately not
I finished Randy's in 4 torturous hours in Momentum Control
I gotta climb to fabled
That's very easy this season
"If I can do it, literally every single player can"
Really?? It feels kind of difficult
You get ~200 ish points and you lose like 10
its skill based matchmaking now
I had 0 glory and matched with a bunch of people with like NF and stuff
not rank based
and I was like wtf
that doesn't even make senseee
but the quest is like revoker
ohhhh what
okay nice
total glory
that's kind of a relief
so no worries
why is competitive sbmm and not ranked
"that defeats the purpose of the rank, doesnt it?"
like why have a rank if it doesn't inherently have to do with skill
yeah.... another question for Bungie I guess
"The reasoning they gave was that the ranks will reflect your skill as more matches are played, so if you are supposed to be at a higher rank you will gain more glory as you win and lose less when you get teamed up with potatoes"
"Oh yeah I remember, it's supposed to get you to your actual rank faster"
It's not as if you weren't getting matched with NF legends last season either
Feel like Bungo thinks @Trissin 's deserved position is 0 lol
"Naw, they believe Trissin deserves a high rank, but has not played enough matches to get there if you are matching with NF monsters"
Unless you are matching Bought Forgottens who migrated over from console?
Maybe glory is circular and 0 is the closest number to 5500/Legend
I wouldn't put a rounding error past them at all lol
Gandhi's nukes have taught me games don't deal well with boundary conditions
Halo at 4K/60 fps looks fairly gorgeous damn
Doesn't look like a 10 year old game
"And the requirements are absurdly low, needs a GTX 770 for 4K@60"
@RonInDune KH3 was okay until the last 4-5 hours where it was amazing but yeah fire emblem was next level im mad it wasnt nominated
I think for some reason they only wanted one Switch game on the GOTY
Fire Emblem being there would honestly just split the votes for Smash
Anybody feel like running the dungeon at some point before the raid tonight?
Who keeps shooting the portals I’m not mad I just want to talk
oof scarlett on 950 is tough
@thegoaliebear gonna be able to make it? I know the school thing is going on
not likely back until 9:50-10ish. so won't be on tonight.
@Destiny [PC] one spot open for all arc titan garden
I would but my internet has been garbage today
I would but my titan is busy eating crayons at the moment.
how long do you reckon it would take @Crizum
also lmao what
"We all have clears, so ideally like an hour or two max"
You didn't know?
"Even less actually, just that the all arc thing means no damage buffs"
the purple crayons arent grape.
The main diet of a titan are crayons. Poor titans eat rose art. Titans with class eat crayola.
"i can help out then @Crizum , just give me one minute"
is there a raid set up for tomorrow evening? I'll definitely be available. I'd like to do one of the all class runs if possible. but just a general GoS run is fine too foe the gear :D
@Destiny [PC] ^^ just made this for tomorrow night. i will definitely be on and will be happy to have a night of gaming aha.

@RonInDune if you join you'd be our 6th 👀
hmm...might get the new G Pro headset. looks fresh as hell.
Putting that Randy's money to good use👌
hahaha yeah there's another headset that's pretty new from a sound lab company that looks really nice too.
https://www.amazon.com/PuroGamer-Gaming-Headset-Headphones-Noise-Canceling/dp/B07XLFDSVP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8
we love that.
I have 5 1/2 hours of watching student presentations coming up so I need something relaxing later
Btw think I figured out why the cyclops kept spawning
"The angelic explodes when killed, and we’ve been killing it as soon as it showed up. Need to let it get away from the boss or it will blow up the crit spots"
love that lol.
That makes a lot of sense
"Would explain why it’s always the left cyclops and only sometimes the right, explosion radius and all that"
"Also read how to do the 20+ vex killed by the platform, if you shoot their heads off they stop trying to sacrifice and just chase people, so you do that and build while they try to murder you"
oou I see lol
first grad school acceptance fam!
Holy cow congrats!
You'll do great!
thanks😊 i still have several more going in but this one was rolling so...earlier you get the app in earlier you get a decision haha.
Some of the Google Stadia options are ... interesting
I didn't know people still used AIM or ICQ
Does MSN messenger even exist anymore? I thought they rolled it in to skype?
Yup it's dead
I think it rebranded as Xbox Live messenger?
but yeah it got shut down centuries ago
Does AIM still exists?
I don't know
lemme check
Surprised there isn’t a spot for Google+ and MySpace
I thought it died in the mid 2000's
Looks like AIM got murdered when Verizon acquired Yahoo and AOL
"Also, do they ask for your ChristianMingle and FarmersOnly accounts too?"
"I loved AIM, feels bad"
Do people legit use those or are they just for memes
Didn't ICQ die as well?
ICQ was almost killed by AOL but I think it's mostly a Russian thing now
I know artists from Russian and other CIS countries often post their ICQ number alongside twitter/fb/insta
"But I didn't think people in the West still used, considering it's somewhat of a security risk"
Ooh can't wait:
The real life eververse
Honestly the books are so good they've got me hook line and sinker
Maybe we'll finally get the most important backstory of all - how the heck did Taeko-3 get a team of 9 Guardians killed in a easy ass strike
Read a theory that the reason we succeed so much is that our guardians are paracausal
I think that they didn't have those void crystals to disrupt whatever was going on
"So they are just bad, a lot of guardians are"
because they died and became those crystals right
that is another explanation
just punch the wizards how hard can it possibly be
so the way I've thought of it is they went in and the shrieker was just immune
"Plus yeah, we wouldn’t have beat VoG if Kabr didn’t get stuck"
A lot of our success is built on the failures of others
"That's true, we're just the tip of the spear"
I think the only thing we didn’t need help of some sort was siva?
"a bunch of mad, dancing guardians killing off Gods and teabagging them"
"VoG we had the relic, Crota we had the knowledge of Eris etc,l"
Except we had help in the form of the big flaming axe against the siva vault
"Yeah actually, none of our success, as impressive as they are in lore, are 100% ours"
Maybe crown of sorrows and scourge?
and in Last Wish we were all being manipulated by two spooky queens from beyond the grave
The Leviathan raids are basically a self contained deal
That and we had the entire great hunt to draw knowledge from
Yeah Shaxx has an Ahamkara skull hanging over his head lol
"The ahamkara whispers to Shaxx, Shaxx just yells louder in response"
"Or is the crucible a granted wish? For Shaxx, he is always yelling fight forever"
Hmm maybe. Spinfoil time
"Always wondered why Eris never helped us out with Riven, she knows how dangerous an Ahamkara can be more than most"
Maybe the VA was busy
Considering her rock is an ahamkara bone? Also she was busy at the time
That also raises the question why there are no Taken on the moon
Maybe cause they belong to Savathûn now and she's manipulating the remains of Crota's brood in a different way
"Feels like Savathun wouldn’t take unless there is a reason for it, it wouldn’t be a tribute to her if she just overrode wills right?"
"Yeah Riven basically took over the remaining Taken and started granting wishes to Savathûn, so she's not getting direct tribute form them"
"Which is another great lore entry by the way, when poor Illyn falls into Riven's trap"
I love the writing in this ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/illyn|| entire lore book
Let’s just get this over with so we can have Destiny 3 launch with 100+ player zone events in a battle against Xivu Arath already
Or do we beat Xivu with peace?
She is basically the Goddess of War
How was the Goddess of War defeated in mythology?
"I mean, Kratos killed them all"
"In Greek mythology, I know Enyo was the Goddess of War, but I don't think she was ever defeated."
Interesting I hadn't heard of ~~Enya~~ Enyo
I have definitely heard of Enya lol
I used to read a lot of mythology but my memory is terrible so I may have misspelled lol
That makes me wish for a new Age of Mythology game
"Just looked it up, Enyo was indeed a goddess of war, called the sister of war ""in a role closely resembling Eris, the embodiment of strife and discord"""
I grew up with Indian myths obviously but there are so many gods and goddesses that you can tell basically any story regarding them and it'd probably turn out to be true
Homer represented them as the same goddess
a *l i n k*
you may have found something **interesting**
time to post to raidsecrets and destinylore
get Byf on Line 1 stat
"""During the fall of Troy, Enyo inflicted terror and bloodshed in the war, along with Eris (Strife), Phobos (Fear), and Deimos (Dread)"""
Bungie is going to get smited by the Greek gods if they rip off too much of their story
"Oh I knew of Phobos and Deimos, that how Mars' moons are named"
"Hey Ron, we met the Taken on Phobos, shortly after we met Eris, and Deimos being dread we ended it on the Dreadnaught"
*lore intensifies*
"Just for fun, here's a photo of Phobos that I processed:"
Taken by the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission
"It may mean nothing but hey I also found this Ron, in the battle between Zeus and Typhon ( a god vs a monster) Enyo didn't take sides"
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
hmmmm
hm
"So Xivu Arath may be playing both sides, is what you're saying?"
"""Eris (Strife) was Typhon's escort in the mellee, Nike (Victory) led Zeus into battle, impartial Enyo held equal balance between the two sides."""
"idk, it's fun to have theories"
"After Niobe Labs, no theory is too far fetched"
"Like, are we the Typhon if Bungie pulls from greek myths? We're not a god like Savathun, but we have been called monsters before?"
I would think God v Monster would be Traveller vs doom dorito
"Or are we Nike, leading the Travler to victory against the Darkness"
Or we actually start splitting into factions and represent both Nike and eris
Who does that make the drifter
Adidas
Just a bunch of dredgens and reckoners doing slav squats
:mind_blown:
Also gunsmith is selling sniper rifle ammo finder if you don't already have it
Will it give heavy or special?
/r/inclusiveor
"Should work for both, grenade launcher finder does. Also if you combine finder with scavenger you get a decent amount"
So I was trying to follow the original process for solving Niobe Labs to see if I could get it on my own
Till I came across this:
"Yeah, no"
woooooow
Also it needs you to read music and I never learned to do that
Wtf is THAT madness and who was on the combined CIA & FBI task force that deciphered that shit?
Warlocks figuring that shit out:
"Me, a Titan, wondering if I punch it or?"
"Lol! You know, with all the similar memes circulating, I no longer feel I meet the Warlock requirements.  Can I re-roll?"
"Ah, I forgot, the first step to enlightenment is admitting you know nothing.  Ty Ghost Bot, my hope is restored."
"Anyone want to run shattered throne? I need to do it for Wish-Ender/Izanagi, and I can't post in the LFG server for some reason"
i think the warmind bot might be having issues rn.
This is the solution to the musical symbols thing btw
might go to the mall today if i do i'm gonna pick up the Pro X headset👀🔥
they announce anything for the next season yet?
"No, may get a roadmap either today or next Thursday"
"Apparently there’s almost nobody playing the stadia version of Destiny, if you group up with two others the game just puts you in empty instances of survival? Literally free fabled"
I think you mean free legend
Ohhh man
Cross save for Unbroken
!pop stadia
Lol 44 people played crucible yesterday on stadia
I want to know which brave souls did a raid though
!pop steam
Holy shit
Not bad
!pop Xbox
Truly the neglected child
Xbox looked at as the red headed stepchild still doing about 34x better
!pvp ps4
!pop ps4
Cross save really shifted the population
And new light certainly made a mark
For sure
Are there any graphs to show how the population rose and shifted over time?
So console+stadia is about 819k
Looks like Xbox lost this particular console war
new light was definitely a big factor. there's new players every day because of it which is good.
Some of the new light players absolutely wreck face in the crucible though
"2,189,000 players yesterday? That math check?"
How does that compare to other big franchises?
For a live service game? Idk
Check steamcharts?
I know for AAA games period it’s a good number but not massive
"But that assumes sales and not players, for daily log-ins that seems good?"
It's 4th on steam
yeah the daily population is very healthy for an ongoing game.
Obviously not good for stadia in general since it was free for anyone who bought it and it launched yesterday
Meaning even people who just wanted to check how it runs are counted
"I’m not amazing at percentages, but how does that break down?"
"i think stadia will do better with more on-the-go games. not sure exactly what kind of games that encompasses tho haha. but as far as these massive AAA games go, i don't see Stadia ever becoming a main platform."
It seems like it would be something to use if you want to do something on the smaller end without access to your main platform of choice
Performance is failing in that regard though
mhmm. and with cross save its like...i already have a PlayStation. i can easily bring that somewhere and play D2 if I wanted.
"They oversold and under delivered, which is normal but I kinda feel like you can’t do that in the age of twitter anymore haha"
You can’t make pie in the sky statements of possibilities when the peanut gallery is getting ready to drag you
i feel like it's a pretty unnecessary thing for a lot of people too tbh. aside from real gaming enthusiasts who have to have all the newest stuff...it really is a whatever kind of thing for vast majority of the market.
"Where it is currently, it's more like in Alpha"
especially with the number of people already planning to get their new console next holiday haha.
They could try to market it to people who don't have a console. Try out all these things you've been missing without as big of an upfront cost
"That’s the market, they want people who don’t want to invest in the latest tech, they aren’t after the pc crowd because the pc crowd will pay premiums for stuff that gives marginal gains, they want the lapsed gamers who don’t want to upgrade every few years"
oh damn best buy has the G935 headset on sale for 99.99
"I'm probably never going to play this, but the Half Life: Alyx trailer has got me super hyped"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2W0N3uKXmo
Wish Destiny worked in VR
"Oh shiiit, I may have to buy a headset now.  I love half-life (doom, resident evil, and silent hill too!) and that looks like  it’s going to be too good to pass up."
"I didn't quite like the first Half Life, felt the mechanics and gunplay was way worse than Quake or Delta Force, but HL2 is legit one of my fave games of all time"
"Agreed, Quake always had one hell of an engine tho and HL 2 definitely felt like a different game entirely.  I remember thinking “holy crap, is this really half life? But it’s so smooth...”"
I think RE4 will always be my fave in the horror genre though.  I played that game to absolute death and then did it again on Wi because you got to actually aim a pistol at targets on screen.
Can still hear Ashley yelling “Leon!” as her dumbass just crouched down and refused to run away.
shit i just had a heart attack i just got the Pro X headset and the mic wasn't picking up anything. turns out you need to install the Logitech G Hub app to sync everything.
damn...was about to be real emo hahaha.
Anybody feel like trying a master hunt time trial or two?
"Hunters too OP, pls nerf"
Hahahahaha haha
"“One hit titans are such bullshit, this is fair though”"
can't wait for the Destiny cookbook too
I actually quite like the top tree warlock overhaul
A mobility focused Warlock class is always appreciated
C O O K B O O K
Is anyone else bothered by how off center the title on the cookbook looks?
The Destiny logo is not part of the text so i'm not sure why they used it to center the text
"As long as I can make a cake shaped like Shaxx's face, I'm fine"
What's the issue with a skillshot 1hko?
There’s no issue and I don’t see the difference as they both have a wind up of some sort. I’m just remarking on this somehow being different
Ah no I love it
It's been too long
"Ah, misunderstood the tone of the messages then"
Apologies
No worries I don’t always come off right in text
I just find it kinda funny and think that now with Hunter having a windup one hit melee that refreshes on precision kills we’ll hopefully hear less about shoulder charge being bs
"All the subclass changes seem pretty nice though, Warlock needed the love"
"Now every class gets their own ohk, and ways to get them back."
The warlock top tree really needs the grenade regen back though
That was very handy
especially combined with sunbracers
Interested in seeing how much bonus damage you get to golden gun with Knock ‘em Down
Probably won’t match Nighthawk but if it’s enough of a buff to full time stompees I’d do it
fam...the mic quality on this headset😩🙌
NO SPOILERS BUT FAM IT WAS SO GOOD.
I'm glad you liked it
okay we got our one wish tho:
Elsa gay.
Aw man so that *was* her coming out song
like...it is *very heavily* coded haha.
That's great! So many show queerbait these days that I've gotten a wee bit jaded
yeah like the interactions when you see it...its very much the same way written like m/f couples are
Xûr's selling OEM again
git it
Where is that shady mofo?
"Noone knows I think, servers are down"
This survey of Destiny players (albeit with a small sample size) is interesting
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akVhVJu93Tv74coTvrhCAUeHCrlJ2UAcln2NW9k0ijQ/edit#gid=1752846963
I didn' realize the age of players skewed so low!
"Oh wow, that is pretty interesting"
"There's a trendline in one of the sheets but I wouldn't read too much into it, R-squared is like 0.07 lol"
Oh no... I’m the weird older guy at the early 20-something party 😔 I thought there were more players around my age.
I feel ancient at 29 lol
"Ouch, I’ve got almost a decade on you"
I’m officially dust now lol
https://tenor.com/view/old-man-grandpa-old-people-gif-13278004
Wait does that make you gen x or millenial
I was born in 82 so I’m right there at the cusp.  I think someone called it xillenial on Reddit.
'xillenial' sounds like a sleeping pill
Surely there's a cooler name
It would be appropriate lol
"Help make me cool again Obi-Ron, you’re my only hope"
1982 was when the greatest album in history dropped - Thriller
So that's a good a name as any
"Not bad, not bad!"
"Are you gen-x or millennial? Neither, I’m a Thriller."
Makes me want to dance
is xur srsly selling OEM
good thing im not playing rn lmao
Servers have gone from a tapir to a weasel.
I feel like this is a downgrade in terms of the circle of life
Hunters really trying to hammer the servers so people can’t buy OEM huh
We as a community are being punished for using recluse too much
It’s also getting close to American thanksgiving and prime ddos season
Brings me back to the days of Christmas of the year Destiny released
I didn't know that was part of the Thanksgiving custom
"kinda what i was wondering, Peronix said Epic was acting stupid earlier too"
Weekends after thanksgiving and Christmas tend to be ddos’d and it’s more noticeable with more people logging on after getting new consoles/games etc
@Peronix lol i see you have appropriately changed your name
Can't. Stop. Vandalizing.
Today's been a bad day for the internet
Another Canadian node issue?
Clearly cyber-truck was *too* powerful for the Internet to handle
woof
"of course, made it all the way to Xur and, purchased the warlock helm and up pops the red banner of doom... can't get back in now.. guess i'll keep waiting and pretend i'm being productive elsewhere"
Cybertruck is too gorgeous for our ugly world
I unironically dig it. Slap a coat of black paint on it👌
Yeah a matte black paint job will make it ridiculously cool
I absolutely love it
Found the problem; everyone hit ctrl+Z until it's working again
nothing happened...
"Must’ve been someone else then, so we’ve confirmed 2 internet users are not the problem.  Still waiting on word from the remaining 4.4 billion"
Is it still not up?
This is way worse than most outages it feels like
"I keep searching articles to see if it is part of a large scale attack (certainly looks that way), but have yet to find anything.  I haven’t tried to get back on for a couple hours now, but I imagine servers are still down/unplayable"
Maybe it's Lizard Squad again
"Honestly kiddie DDOS tools are dime a dozen, anyone with a sufficient grudge can do a lot of damage"
"The anonymous hacker, 4chan"
I picked up Norman reedus and the fucked up fetus today
My favorite musical
I too love the Crown of Sorrows raid
"After seeing some gameplay and stuff I decided to give it a go, and if I don't like it I can trade it in"
Have you played it yet? Can you *be* the fetus?
*Can I date Mads Mikkelsen?*
See that would win GOTY easily
Kojima was going through some stuff in that game haha
Is he ever not?
like a monster energy addiction...
"Okay yes, all you drink in that game is monster energy and beer"
Gotta piss red white and blue to reconnect America
So if it takes kidney disease to do so
Just sounds like my friend's frat
Destiny is back and running
You say that now...
I'm playing
It's says the clan servers are unavailable
"I just read there may be a queue, so maybe test servers or a gradual restoration in goin down.  Bodes well for the raid"
Yeah I was actually thinking of rescheduling for a later date considering the server issues
"Queue seems quick enough but dunno if people want to risk it, whoever is on could run other things"
"Lol, define *removing*"
guns
bullets
heads
yeeting everyone out of the game apparently
Yeah I don't trust raiding at this point
I’m cool with that. Hate to get part way through sanctified and dropped
"@Peronix I haven't even opened it yet I've literally been home for like 5 minutes, ya degenerate"
Also why are there two of you
"I think I’ll work on 21% tonight, shouldn’t have far to go now"
@Arixama I am omnipresent
Doesn't this Halo reach Season progression look very similar to what we have in Destiny right now?
looks like a general season pass yeah
Did Reach have anything like this originally?
"Not that I can remember, I mean you could unlock different bits of armor to customize even in Halo 3, but it was usually tied to rank/doing certain things in game"
Honestly the entire UX for Reach seems to be very similar to Destiny so far
Yeah looking again it Reach they started costing credits you'd earn through gameplay
So Reach had MTX?
"Naw, they were earned in game"
tied to rank
Ohh that's good
So the better you did the faster you'd earn them
https://www.halopedia.org/Armor_permutations_(Halo:_Reach)
EVA[C] should look slightly familiar to you
Oof this looks very intimidating
"Halo 5 didn't have seasons, but it did have micro transactions so this isn't really a surprise"
Is Halo 5 even coming to PC?
I don't see the announcement
likely not. 5 is not part of the MCC.
Feel like it'll be a dead game once the MCC is out
"oh man, I do wish my friends didn't all abandon Halo 5 cause I had a lot of fun with that PvPvE mode"
What was that mode like?
Gambit-ish?
"5 probably will get ported to pc in some capacity, but they're probably focused on mcc right now"
5 is technically on PC already.
Custom Games/Forge only but it is on PC.
"lot of issues for it though, mouse input stuff among other bugs"
Infinite is launching late next year so 343 will have their hands full
I honestly cant imagine them putting everything but 5 on pc.
Ron https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3My_2vZQjBI
Wait that trailer doesn't explain it at all haha
Also that trailer is very frenetic
What was that infection mode?
about a minute in it starts
"Infection started as a custom online gametype, iirc started mainly as swords vs shotguns. Sword team started with one player"
"that's Firefight Crizum, Warzone was separate"
"But faster movement, when they killed a shotgun player they swapped to sword team"
oh damn that sounds like a great mode
"and yeah I'm trying to find a video that isn't ""MOST  INSANE WARZONE MATCH 98 KILLS"" and got the wrong thing"
ah my bad
And was there a football mode of some kind?
I'm not signed in my pc so hopefully this one works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av-N5smXFpw
"yeah, Grifball which has been around since like.... Halo 3?"
Yeah Warzone looks amazing
Is that part of Halo 5 forge on PC?
Honestly all the multiplayer stuff for Halo 5 looks so good
Halo has had tons of customizable gametypes
you could technically force load the maps for a while but I think it got patched out
Infection became an actual gametype in 4 or 5
Infection was a gametype back in 3
Does the gunplay still feel simlar to Destiny?
It started in Halo 2
"Well, moreso I mean with the flood and stuff"
Like will my noob D2 curcible skills carry over
not just a supported player gametype? idk words haha
The only time Flood models were involved was H4
It's been matchmade since Halo 3
Was it a rotator?
"Was in the social playlists IIRC, definitely was in Reach for matchmaking"
I don't really remember about 3 and if it was just a rotator or not
In Reach it was fixed
I miss assault
Fixed as in always present
"Yeah, they had a lot of those goofier gametypes as rotated playlists, like at one point Team Fiesta was a thing?"
Also if you thought Crucible was sweats
Lockout.
"what weighs heavier, 1 ton of gold or 1 ton of iron?"
.... both weigh the same?
:goal_finger_guns:
oo new emoticon
:goal_finger_guns:  YASSS
haha figured i might as well. i might put my hype emote in too.

Lies
Spinfoil hat time but apparently people are saying the stadia version had google checking for stuff they shouldn’t be checking for and it tripped bungies malware sensors?
oooooooo
Like it was sniffing packets or something
"Huh that sounds reasonable, but it shouldn't take down *all* platforms, should it?"
Hahaha but at least while scrolling through the replies on twitter we got this gem
Bungie reporting that all services are back online now (as of 10m ago)
"Well, D2 services; D1 is still down"
Apparently Bungie is 5th on the list of developers with all time high metcritic scores
Pretty cool
Which games are this based of? its the only the Halo games + Destiny right?
And Myth/Oni/Marathon as well
oh really was those games good as well?
Oni was *amazing*!
"I've never played anything quite like that one, except perhaps Remember Me"
And Marathon pioneered quite a bit of modern FPS standards
And Myth 2 was actually a fairly interesting RTS
Yeah remember playing myth II for a bit
A few of those studios don’t have very many titles haha
"Which is to say those that do have a bunch of titles is impressive, MPS Labs for example"
anyone down to do pit of heresy?
My first title! Took way to long to get... time to take a break I think. hah
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) cancelling raid post
Congrats!!! @link270
"@Yeti ok, I wasn’t sure if I was gonna make it in time tbh. Just now got home from the store and starting dinner"
Congratz @link270 😄
so /r/raidsecrets found a way to one shot some bosses using melee
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtFd0l_bY34
Here's them yeeting Morgeth
https://gfycat.com/floweryrespectfulcaterpillar
Omfg that's glorious
Time to solo insurrection prime
peronix is doing real good at his solo flawless pit attempts
https://clips.twitch.tv/PlainColdClintRiPepperonis
Woo!!! Get it @Peronix
Good luck!!!!
Man finishers are super broken
Apparently you can two person the queenswalk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpyLEUXwTWE
And it's super simple too
Oh boy
There's also a million solo Morgeth videos out already
Do they fix it next season or do they pull the servers Monday
Omg 2 man???
Maybe they'll disable finishers completely
I've heard of 3 man but not two
"Yeah and they were basically joking around the whole attempt, it seems very easy"
"Also, this breaks heavy ammo finisher too, you can essentially get infinite heavy, cuase it doesn't consume your super"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g865QQ1XTcs&feature=youtu.be
Wonder if you could use it to skip almost all of the pit
glitch is very ez to do
when it wants to work
I'll be on super late tonight w a stream too. like 10:45 EST most likely. just gonna be chillin with vex offensive stuff if course lol.
we really need an emblem that tracks your VO completions.
"So you can two tap in crucible using a Better Devils glitch
https://redd.it/e0uyrl"
">>> For this glitch you need to have two different BD. One with explosive payload and one with timed payload. Switch them in your inventory several times and then ""enjoy"" 96 to the head."
Wtf
"So the solo insurrection prime was done by a Canadian titan:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX4DynTbxZ0&feature=youtu.be"
👀 @Trissin
omg I wanna try
DO EEEET
Join the Canadian titan master race
here's an easy macro for the cheese btw:
:o ooh nice!
is q your melee and y is finisher?
"it's not my screenshot btw, it's from raidsecrets"
https://redd.it/e0qfng
Ohhh lol
@Destiny [PC] anyone up for a Garden run tonight? like 8:45 EST?
What if I've never run Garden before and also suck at raiding :thinkloading:
Would you mind if we took 2 guardians on their first run or do you wanna speed run this?
I'm fine with whatever. as long as everyone else in the run has done it before.
I can run if there is an open spot
If they don't run do you want to go for another subclass triumph? I think I just need solar
i only need arc but I'm down doing an all solar run again.
@Destiny [PC] ^^ for tonight.
"if the first run goes smooth, which i'm sure it will, would yall want to do a second run for the all arc triumph? i still need that one."
"I’d be down yeah, also thinking of making a run or two for Wednesday, maybe knock out a triumph or two"
okay. i don't think i'll be available at all wednesday-saturday since i'm going home for thanksgiving. and i don't feel like setting up my PC and moving it around only for a few days lol.
"Lol, hey maybe you can log in ps4 and get them a clear"
@Buttkikker you around?
yeah i should be free tonight and tomorrow night through the weekend
"Trying to get these time trials done before reset, wondering if you were interested haha"
"If we could get a third I can go anytime today, popped in discord"
@Destiny [PC] Anybody around feel like giving the time trials for 980 hunts a shot?
i can hop on for like 1-1.5 hours around 3:45 EST if yall can try then.
Yeah that works we can wait
cool. i'll @ ya when i'm on.
@Crizum @Buttkikker just got on.
What weapons would you guys recommend for cold fusion medals? I'm trying to farm out the rest of mine.
I used a fast firing fusion: Zealot's Reward for mine
Jotunn and Erentil are also good options
High Impact fusions are your best best.
"Ok, thank you."
I got mine with loaded question and tempered dynamo
but a high impact or adaptive with back up plan will get it done
I like how you can place first 5 times in a row and still lose games in survival
Is it true that having lots of incomplete catalysts decrease catalyst drop rates?
"^^
Is that true???? That might explain a lot"
Some people on reddit were syaing it but I couldn't find a proof
Solo queenswalk? Surprised they haven’t turned off finishers already
"Thanks for the advice, the cold fusion medals are going well."
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VbqzTMPU_Ss
holy crap it's actually on his RR as well
what an achievement
The solo scourge thing is so crazy too lol
solo flawless last wish emblem in season of dawn?
ahaha i think those are separate badges
It looks like you need to be a Titan to do the solo
Unless warlock/hunter have something like the feedback fence?
It's hunter or titan I thought?
"The solo queenswalk I mean, hunter can do the glitch but the thing that let him get finishers off was feedback fence since you can’t drop the ball"
"@Trissin you can take my spot today, im gonna help couple friends"
lol that should be fine
we are in party chat
@Destiny [PC] ^ if anyone missed it
i kind of want to get escape from tarkov. anyone here play it? i've been watching Lupo when he streams it and it seems pretty cool.
community is cancer
but how is the actual game lol.
"Gameplay is solid, but the whole ""persistent health"" thing they put in this patch has killed the game for me."
"Their netcode is hot garage sometimes, but at it's core it's a great shooter with milsim leanings"
yeah i saw it's still in beta testing so I'd imagine they have a lot going on with patches aha. it seems cool enough tho. i might pick it up.
@Destiny [PC] for people going for Undying that have yet to complete a 980 Nightfall this week it’s Inverted Spire which is one of the easier ones to complete
@Crizum what time are you thinking
"I’ve got it done already, just a psa for those that haven’t"
thanks I'll give it a try
@Destiny [PC] I know lots of people are traveling but if anyone is interested^^
Garden of Mediocre Loot
if only cross play existed.
Playing against Stadia players in the Crucible😩👌
"Steam autumn sale is up, and the pixel art wallpaper they have on is so good"
">>> Challenge: Once you first bank, you have 10 seconds to fully fill the bank. Send 1 in, do a full clear, then 2 in the same side, pick up extra motes, get 10 each. Pull, and all 3 people bank 10 motes one after another."
"Honestly, sending two teams of two is going to be *way* more consistent"
Yeah that's what I was thinking
I believe that shielded goblins don't spawn until you bank the first time?
"Yup, if noone's enlightened they are not supposed to spawn"
this breaks on second damage phase
And team one should have buff when they come back from the second side
at first I thought this was for 3rd encounter and I thought this was gonna be hella difficult
So basically take the encounter slow? Do the shielded goblins stop spawning if the people enlightened run off their buff?
"No, they continue to spawn"
But they don't start spawning until someone deposits
"So thtis shouldn't be too difficult, I'm down to try it ASAP"
"Got it, so it seems like they do three in each portal so that all six people go in"
Three in blue get to babysit while the three rotate in red
"Or, I guess, the teams tag out, so whoever stays the first time swaps with one of the teams"
Does it spawn more enemies if more people go in?
"Naw, but if you are quick enough and clear everything the prior team will leave notes behind if they don’t grab them all"
So by grabbing 10 and still clearing those motes will be there if you are quick enough along with a new set of enemies
Then why send 3 people? Send the two teams of 2.
"One person gets 10, leaves motes on the floor, the next time two go in, they get the motes for them and whatever else was left, which should total 30, when they get back and bank the other three people repeat that on the opposite side"
There's no guarantee you'll spawn on the side with motes though. Sending 2 and picking up all the motes is going to be way more consistent
Do we know if 10 has to be banked or just a total of 30?
It’s the same side? You just spawn on opposite ends so yeah you’d have to run
"If it has to be 10 each time, then that makes sense, but there's no reason to risk stupid deaths if it doesn't have to be 10"
The only hang up I can see is maybe the time it takes for 4 people to deposit puts them outside of the challenge time limit?
"So folks what's the best black shader? If I want to go the Men In Black look on my lock, what's some good shaders?"
Superblack
"Yeah no pure black shaders, you could try Fright Night, Skele-Ghaul, Bloody Tooth, or Amethyst Veil, but those will all have undertones of other colors"
Yeah that's what was happening
I'll try Skele Ghaul though don't remember that
I like how Shadowstrike looks nothing like the preview would have you believe
if anyone wants to do a run of garden tonight we need two more for 8 tonight.
god I hate pvp so much
i absolutely detest it
This is why I secretly bribe oathbreaker to get me glory
can we please remove snipers from the game
"140s as an archetype, sure"
"but 90s and 72s, hell no"
merge 140s into 90 rpm snipes and nix the 140 archetype
"Finally got hive armaments, bloody hell"
"I never want to do Menagerie ever again, but I also want to get Shadow someday lol"
@Destiny [PC] i know it's pretty in advance but would people want to do an all arc subclass run of Garden on sunday night? maybe get a challenge done too?
I'll make a post some time this week long as i know there's interest.
Interesting discussion about Ada-1:
"I always thought that Bungie should make more of the fact that Ada-1 is perhaps the oldest being in the tower, she was literally created as the collapse was happening"
"Ooh wow, that's interesting"
I never really noticed she was so different from other exos
"She seems really fragile too, looks like she was made of porcelain."
Compare that with combat Exos like Cayde or Banshee
and how rugged they look
I can't get a good shot of the Exo stranger from D1 but I assume she was a combat exo too
The exos were created before the collapse. Cayde and Elsie bray(the exo stranger) were exos before the collapse.
"THey've all been reset multiple times since then, except for Lakshmi and Ada"
We don't know if the exo stranger has been reset.
THey really should spend one of these seasons/expansions going into more depth on the Exos and the Deepstone Crypt
Such a fascinating concept
We only found her identity through some of her journals. I wish they would go deeper into her backstory.
She was a cool character! Wasn't there hints that our intereactions with her were chronologically backwards from her perspective?
She was a bray who decided to cooperate with the ishtar collective so she had access to their vex research. So it's very possible it's backwards.
Oh man there's so much possibility in Destiny
That also brings up an interesting question about exos. Does their age start when they were created or does it start over when they reset?
"Interesting, they must age, because otherwise Ada-1 would still be a baby mentally"
But if they kept aging there'd be people who'd be 500 years old
Well technically we don't know how long ago the collapse happened so it could have been centuries or millinea.
@Destiny [PC] ^^ for sunday night holy shit it's almost December yall
time to bring out the holiday panels/alerts/cam box for the stream LOL
"That's true, I used this timeline to guide my thoughts, it seems accurate-ish"
https://i.imgur.com/ef191cD.jpg
There's so much here that I don't understand but it sounds super interesting
"There's lots of things hidden in secret lore tabs or item descriptions, kinda like how Dark souls does it"
The very first things in the timeline are from the Eris lore that you get by talking to here every week (Unveiling)
Is that official bungie timeline or someone's best guess?
Best guess
"It's more or less accurate, but there are a few things, especially around the Great AHamkara hunt that are open to second guessing"
"I think the Nine are pretty interesting, I'd like to learn more about them"
I love the Nine's aesthetic too!
The Emissary ||used to be a Guardian|| yes?
"Her name was ||Orin, after resurrection. She was originally Nasya, part of Mara Sov's ship that went to the distributary and became awoken ||"
She was ||murdered in her sleep by new guardians (risen) soon after she came to Earth||
Wait wtf
She was also a ||friend of the drifter before he betrayed her||
"Wow, okay then"
Quite a lot going on
"I'd highly recommend the Lore book Ecdysis, which tells her (Very tragic) story"
||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-ecdysis||
"ooh, thank you!"
All this raises so many more questions lol
The love story of ||Namqui and Orin is super emo lol||
Badass
"Destiny's lore is actually so interesting, there's so much going on at once"
"They get actual sci fi authors to write their most important lore, so that's why it's all so polished"
"And it's not only focused on major events, there are details about characters' personal lives and interests and motives + etc"
I love it all!
aha maybe I'll get into it. I've got soo many lore triumphs I haven't earned/found yet
"Lore hunting is my main goal in the game lol, it's so good!"
I feel that it's both a pro and a con that there's not really a place to go to/start to find all the lore
"True, but atleast they've gotten better since Forsaken"
"Kind of pushes you to explore and learn about the world in a more ""real"" sense if that makes sense"
"Also a very rude ~~Titan~~ Hunter called me fat, in a sparrow that dropped from a bright engram yesterday"
"Speaking of lore, can anyone help me with a small project? It's regarding ||Paladin Oran||"
What you need
"So, I want to go through all the lore that has Paladin Oran in it, and figure out what the hidden messages are"
"Basically any piece of lore that has ""Paladin Oran"" mentioned, has an acrostic within it"
Like the message from cayde?
">>>  Oh, and, uh, tell ""Paladin Oran"": If the sun over Nessus escapes nebula cycle, evac labor after dawn, under solstice. You got that, P.V.?"
"The first letters spell out:
>>> Its on Enceladus"
"And in Letters from Cayde he says:
>>> MESSAGE IS:

You miss me already, huh? If you're looking for another excuse to shirk your Vanguard duties I'll play along.

By the way, thought you'd be interested in this report from Paladin Oran:

Free irregular kelvin radiation underneath liminal atmosphere layers in Venusian entryway. Deep interstellar simulation traces reveal elongated sidereal screens. Caldera apertures leave long free radical omissions. Mitigate if lateral lacerations yield neutrons.

MESSAGE ENDS"
OH SHIT.
"The secret text is:
""Fikrul Alive. Distress Call from Illyn"""
yaya. that's wild.
I can't figure out the Telesto one says
Apparently the Prodigal Mark for titans have one
||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/telesto||
The message spells out ||Uldren found||
Niceeeee
Great work damn
"Can anyone decrypt this:
||crowuntrustworthydesiresPOwer||"
"Maybe:
||crow untrustworthy desires POwer|| but that doesn't really make sense?"
||Don’t trust Mara basically||
BUt crows are ||Uldren's||
"Oh I thought there was an N there, yeah that makes sense people call ||Uldren the Crow||"
my guess is that it ||relates to Mara or Uldren||. given that he was found and ||resurrected as a Guardian. it could mean that he's still always going to lean toward the darkness and always have a quest for power and still should not be trusted especially if he's able to wield Light||
Also isn’t there a lore book called ||Truth to Power||?
"Yeah the Savathun one, 999 power and all that"
big brain theories here.
Could just be the connection of ||Uldren being played by Savathun||
"shitpost aside, the Telesto lore is itself interesting, since it says ""Vestiges of the Queen's Harbingers yet linger among Saturn's moons."" and Harbingers are the weapon Mara used to neutralize Oryx's superweapon"
She also used the harbingers to destroy Ceres and the Wolf Kell
as seen in ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/ghost-fragment-fallen-4||
"New headset, hopefully won’t destroy y’all’s ears"
@Crizum thank god lol.
Nice if peronix can get his mic fixed for discord we'll be set
Apparently it’s quiet but I’ve got no idea how to fix it
wow the ps4 clan is........😂
oh no what happened
"wel the people i used to raid with, naturally, don't ever reply to anyone else in the lfg chat."
dead.
"oof, I'm sorry to hear that"
just happy to be part of the PCMR hahaha
Iron banner anyone?
just picked up the HyperX Pulsefire Surge on sale 🔥
Ive heard reports that mouse has fallen victim to power outages many times. May want to invest in a good Surge protector
Your criticisms activate my trap card
*F u r b y*
❤️
sniping in survival is a real boomer play
especially if your whole fireteam has the same kit
......and my solo adventure for the recluse has now come to a close
i mean why would you not have a surge protector in the first place.
Because you like feeling the surge of adrenaline when it starts storming
"@Saint 14's loyal follower grats on Recluse, it’s too good of a weapon honestly haha"
@Saint 14's loyal follower Yeah you're in the big boys club now ^^
We all wear matching shirts
"Throw on a OEM, pair your recluse with a mountaintop"
You get this shirt if you do
@Crizum  xD
damn this black friday sale for escape from tarkov really has their servers messed up so much lol.
apparently it's taking people hours upon hours to receive their beta download invitation 😂
"its official, Battlefield V is busted"
"i mean...it's kind of frustrating, but i do understand a bit. since it's still in beta i can imagine they were definitely not prepared for the massive influx of preorders."
"especially since their black friday sale was $13 off. so, a pretty nice pick-up."
Good luck y'allll
@LW Mugetsu @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @Saint 14's loyal follower Yall still gonna try the raid?
@Yeti yeah
@Destiny [PC] anyone wanna back up if sarsante doesnt join?
"I’ve only got like two hours before people show up to my place, but if you need someone I can help for a bit"
were probably gonna need it
we're*
if only cross play existed. but no. i have to brave the ps4 side tomorrow.
@thegoaliebear it'll be ok.
oh right i have you for support.
we'll get through it.
cross play iron banner would be hot garbage
"Yea, there's no way we could beat Stadia players"
they're too advanced
just cross play for raids. the only thing that really matters.
they can make moves before they happen
we'll make the moves on them 3 seconds before they even look at us with that input lag.
*big brain latency*
"goal, are you ready for cancerous menu times?"
oh my god.
i still have to update the game on ps4. i have to face the update times😂
"oh god, make sure you do that"
i had to do mine the other day and it wanted me to have like 80 gigs free for a 2 gigs update
hah yeah i only have a couple other games on my ps4.
"@Destiny [PC] I’ve got like 30 minutes before I have to log off, is anyone able to finish out the raid if need be?"
lmao i was plugging my ps4 back in and my ethernet cable popped out of the wall and bc my main port it weird it needs to sit in it a certain way my ethernet isn't working now. shouldn't have bothered :)))
ahh...found the spot and it's working again lmao. love that.
Anyone wanna do GoS? @1minatur  and myself haven't done it yet (At all..) and also need to do the divinity steps.
unfortunately can't tonight and have a raid tomorrow night. but I'm free Mon-Weds nights.
https://youtu.be/VfOS01AYdtM Quick video about the challenge we’ll be going for
"@Destiny [PC] ^ for Monday, looking up other ways to do the challenge as well"
is it possible to solo zero hour?
but it's a bit challenging
id still recommend a team
yeah it's a lot harder now with the changes that were made this season.
wait it's harder now? Why is that
but with a group of 3 you can tear through it.
Its gotten harder with the nerf to auto reload and nova bomb
I didn't find any difference
I didn't really use auto-reload on my titan back then cuz no MT
that's a yikes from me chief
Trissin low key bragging
gotta flex
“Oh you guys don’t just melee everything? Huh”
sorry didn't mean to tho
what a boomer thing to say
It's certainly doable but hard
"got it, solo is possible...."
now just gotta grind for 8 hours.....
Could probably find people who need it or are good to run it
I seem to recall there were other people here who needed zero hour too
but I might be wrong
i have a feeling there are people who need it done
"So i've been at this about the last 3 hours and can't figure it out, so I need some help from the computer people here"
"I don't know what's happened, but right now when I try to play destiny I'm getting a max of like 25 frames in open world/activities"
i'm fine in orbit and in menus
and I can't figure out what's wrong
What are your CPU/GPU temps?
well the first thing is open resource monitor and see what's running when Destiny is on
around 60 both
nothing else is running
I've closed everything except for destiny
drivers and all are all updated
no windows updates or anything
i tried unisntalling and reinstalling graphics drivers
tried playing with power settings and stuff too
"there might be background services that are hidden, use the resource monitor graph"
sometimes it's just windows indexing or something
and it's got nothing to do with my destiny graphics settings either
I opened a couple other games and they were also stuck at this low fps
"but for destiny, as soon as I open my inventory or menu the frames come back"
and i'm fine in orbit too
Might be RAM issue then? it's slowing down when it's loading up map assets
is your game on an SSD
"yeah, it's on my d drive"
Maybe the SSD is having issues
use something like crystal disk mark
shots in the dark basically
"wait rewind, 60 degrees Celsius ?"
or Fahrenheit
Celsius..?
Is that high??
No way
Check if your GPU fans are still working
my PC starts lagging at 65
"They are working, yeah"
60 celsius is high.
almost very high
Depends on the CPU. Modern CPUs can afford to hit 60
Unless we're talking idle temps
mine idles at like 50 after a long ass game sesh
"I think Ron was right, it's probably an issue with my ssd"
yikes....
"yeah if its working fine on a place with less textures, then it's probably having difficulty loading data"
"damn, forgot texture data takes up alot of game space......"
I just want to finish my undying title :c
oh my god overwatch is literally like 12 fps
XD
i'm on the menu screen
not even in practice range or anything
thats not good
now this. this is a look.
Reminds me of the half melted T-1000
looks kind of like Bender from Futurama
Is that the empryean cartographer set?
is it going away with season of undying?
"damn, wish i had money"
oh my god idk what happened but the problem went away
this is unreal
I'm glad to hear it is working for you now.
@Trissin i would assume so.
@Saint 14's loyal follower only reason I was able to get it is bc its 600 silver and i had 1000 since i had cross save from ps4.
@Trissin I don't think destiny is built on the unreal engine :derp:
yes. save me.
it's the same people everytime @_@
"I can skip if needed no worries, I've run the raid plenty"
"well i'm fine with teaching someone, but tonight i just don't have the time."
and i may have been burnt out by the ps4 run last night :travelergoogly:
How were the frames?
oh god.
i still have to suffer today to try and get them the boss clear.
The auto aim is the worst part
if we don't have 6 tho...can't say i'll be disappointed LOL.
I feel bad for the PS4 group then
it's just stupid bc the most experienced raiding players over there literally never respond to anything in the lfg. they just have their own private DM.
"that's weird, communication is the whole purpose of the lfg chat"
yeah. idk what their deal is. i'll probs do something about it lol.
"@Hotdog You can always make an LFG post yourself for a time that works for you, we have a lot of members that are pretty active on the discord. Just make sure you do an ```@pc or @Destiny [PC]```"
Don't you just hate it when you &436804979399852032
I've just been using Destiny App
This clan seems to have only the same group raiding each time for pc
"I think that’s more because it’s the most active in discord people,  but people are usually willing to either hop out or help in teaching runs assuming time will allow. Anyone is free to sign up for a slot and I feel bad if the impression is it’s always the same people."
"It has kinda been the same group gunning for the challenges true, but aside from that I try to join what I can with newer runs, did see I missed link @link270 mentioning a run, but if you have a time to come or want to take my spot tonight let me know"
yeah just put up an lfg post for whenever you're available and if we're available then we'll join.
i know personally i'm just really busy right now so if i do a run i prefer a quick clear. but this wednesday night i have time if there are people who want to learn Garden.
^ yeah if you want to do a newer player run Wednesday and have people sign up as alts that have previous clears?
having 3 experienced and 3 new is what i usually like to roll with if possible.
"I finally had time to run it for the first time last night, and with the semester almost over I can hopefully be more active and help out with some raids and other things at more times too. It is a busy time though, so I imagine most people just don’t have a lot consecutive time to commit right now."
yeah i have winter break coming up so my schedule is gonna be all over the place.
"@Yeti speaking of, what is a good night to get @MrJ and @Snorlax back in Garden?"
i'm down to make a run for wednesday evening if there's enough interest.
"Im down for whatever, after a bunch of weapons got a piece of gear from nighthunt yesterday. 956 drops here I come"
is it better to get a all purpose mic or just get a headset with one....
just get a headset with one tbh.
i love when classes get cancelled tomorrow because the roads are legit covered in ice yet we still have practice in the morning 🤔
because risking our safety for one extra practice is definitely gonna make a difference when we play the worst team in our league this weekend.
morning practices kinda blow when it comes to swim team and water  polo
water is always freezing cold
its even worse when its an outdoor pool....
and its 50 degrees outside
good luck at your league game
i don't mind morning practices bc at least i don't have to deal with it for the rest of my day lol.
like i'll hate it no matter what. but at least i get it over with early haha.
facts tho
"our goalie this season is leaving for Penn state, and i have the feeling next season is going to blow, cuz im gonna be goalie...."
and that means twice as many practices....
i honestly love when we play penn state. everything about their arena slaps.
solidarity for the goalies of the world
like why can't some random multi millionaire just give us a bunch of money to get a new rink.
"for real tho, that can be applied to anything"
we want a new pool
but nooooooooooo
do we want to do 6 missile bois again tonight?
unless your titan doesn't have access to the raid rn haha.
It doesn't
but i'm gonna use my titan boi.
Haven't played on my titan at all this season
You got like 15 minutes hurry up
Right........ About that
Not happening
Well okay I guess Luna boots work with rifts so just use an empowering one
no classes because of weather lets go
i still got practice lmao.
"Ended up bringing this lil turkey home from the family visit.  My wife’s brother got him for a bird hunting dog, but he has yet to point and he’s deaf.  I swore “NO MORE PETS!” but when her bro said free to a good home I knew he’d get what he needs with us.  Trained many a dog, but never a deaf one.  He’s awesome, and just like a typical bumbly puppy in every way.  I can tell he’s smart and he’s definitely got some personality."
:blob: 😍
"I dont know what they taught you in school, thats not a turkey"
"@Arixama So you think I should take it out of the oven?  It seems a little big to pan fry, I don’t have a deep fryer so that’s not an option."
"ok there was something funky going on, I knew I had done the raid on my titan before:"
and i can launch the raid on my titan
hm...that is strange.
it happened before tho on a run i did.
They must have changed the raid access requirements for some reason
But I can launch the raid right now
This is all very weird
"As we all know, gos works perfectly. No glitches."
"Just got timeless vigil, now the last thing left for undying is randy's"
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Godspeed
"Momentum control is back, right? Or is that next week?"
"This upcoming reset, I believe"
@Destiny [PC] ^ still have some spots open for tonight. will be trying the boss encounter challenge.
halo reach comes out tomorrow so everyone should just collectively go awol
"I just returned from AWOL status and can hold some pretty interesting convos with myself so I’ll be here when everyone comes back, keeping the coffee hot and fresh"
"@Trissin congrats! You can do it! If you want a teammate who will try to set up kills for you, hit me up!"
"I don’t know if we already have a challenge strat in place, but I found what looks to be a pretty solid one that isn’t a big stretch from the way we’ve been running it. Requires lots of Izanagi’s, great add clear/power (nade launchers), titan bubble (ideally with Oppressive Darkness nade on titan), well of radiance, and good communication. Uses the 1 tether strat as well: https://youtu.be/6FX78unZSrc
If y’all had a different one in mind, let me know and I’ll delete this to avoid confusion."
"I got my izanagi, so we can try"
I'm fine with whatever. always love to be a tether buddy.
"@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) that strat sounds good, we’ll try it out"
Daily dose of d’awwww courtesy of Boone the Deadpool doggo.
"Watch out for Cruella de Vil, Deadpool doggo!"
raids are wierd
raids are perfect. always work as intended😜
*reads name of discord*
@rozak you ready
"This is what peak Halo Reach looks like. You may not like it, but this is it."
"Just keep that gif and post it whenever someone says “crucible is bullshit, remember when bungie could balance?”"
Well that's when Bungie stopped being able to balance really well
"That being said, still better than the Crucible, but damn if both aren't fun as fuck"
"Yeah I’m looking forward to getting in some invasion matches, and some big team"
"SWAT, Infection, Team Slayer, *Firefight*"
4 man Legendary Campaign with some buddies
Gonna be so good
Get ready for those LASO runs
LASO is insanity
Looking at the achievements they did take out the “Assassinate an Elite to survive a fall that would normally kill you” so that’s nice
I did it like once on Nightfall but it was ridiculous at times
THEY TOOK IT OUT
THAT WAS A FUCKING FUN CHALLENGE
"Achievement list, spoilers for those who haven’t played it || https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Halo-The-Master-Chief-Collection/dlc/Halo-Reach-Campaign||"
Is there a preload for Reach?
"No preload, goes live 10 am tomorrow which is also when Bungie is streaming about season of dawn haha"
10 am pst
There's something on the Xbox app. I don't know how much it actually downloads tho
1 MORE DAY
WHO IS READY FOR HALO
"If you're in super and you go through a titan rally barricade, can it still kill you?"
I dont believe rally barricade can kill at all. They can leave you at like 1 hp tho
might be wrong
"Yeah iirc they’ll always bring you down to 1, regardless of how much you have"
I’m ready for halo
Season of undying ends tomorrow right? And the undying title goes away?
Next Tuesday
oh it's not tomorrow
they'll do the season of the dawn livestream tomorrow
"It’s actually Wednesday I read it wrong, but yeah"
ah okay
Season of the Enjoy Reach
how big is the reach campaign? Doable in one day?
did legendary co-op in a few hours
"Yeah, but replayable. Most of the achievements are for par score/par time, solo on legendary, laso etc"
man I can't wait
Haven't played Halo since Vista
for reach i got to play the weekend before it released. one of the guys i used to game with got a press copy and he invited me over
that's actually super cool
Reach wasn't as big an event as 3 was it?
"I never had an xbox, so I only got to play halo when I invaded my friends' places lol"
"Cultural event you mean? Don’t believe so, COD was on the upswing at that point"
"Was still big though, least where I was"
reach was definitely as big as 3 was if not bigger
halo 3 is just more nostalgic because thats where forge and customs games started
reach just made it better
reach is highly considered the 'best' halo
"though, halo 3 would probably be considered the most memorable"
i dont feel like this math adds up
It's Vex Math
It's for Shadowkeep lol
that's how the vex calculate things.
"haha I was just looking, it's like 20 for Shadowkeep, 15 for Forsaken, and new light is new light"
"It's funny, not gonna lie"
do i need to by season passes for pc and ps4 or do those share across?
Season passes will carry
what about the digital deluxe items?
Those will as well
just trying to figure out what i need to buy to play on pc
Ever verse purchases etc
That bundle pretty much if you want to do everything
the digital one or just the dlc?
if you bought the digital deluxe on ps4 you only need to buy base SK on PC
deluxe not digital
Just the dlc
ok that is what im looking for
If you set up cross play you’ll have whatever digital deluxe stuff you bought on PS4 as it still counts the ps4 as your primary account
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/CrossSave
yeah i aready have that set up
"alright, now im just waiting for it to download"
Man you really wanna finish that raid lol
"nah, well i mean i do but i had the pc version a while ago, i just moved back to ps4 for a bit"
lol you don't gotta lie.
your right || i just wanted to be part of the master race ||
fair but i think i moved to PC before you Goal lol
but i havent been for a bit haha
doesn't count.
yeah ill give you that

me when i got my PC
https://tenor.com/view/bye-goodbye-so-long-peace-wizard-of-oz-gif-7723686
aw i wasnt a gif
eh the point still stands
it's even better bc it wasn't a gif.
is there even any raids gong on on pc tonight?
I assume its full up?
@Nexeran You can take my place if you want. Feeling pretty exhausted anyways
that'd be fine. we're also attempting the boss challenge @Nexeran
"ok ill have to look up the boss challenge, are we doing fresh run or just boss?"
full run
"ok, i think i understand the challenge, are you doing the 7 motes for the first team?"
I think that’s how we’ll handle it yeah
Ok...now I just hope the damn install finishes soon...
"I'm on and ready to rock the GoS, gonna step out for a smoke rq"
it says 13 minutes remaining
whats your steam name Nex?
irourgiro
"@Destiny [PC] One spot open for Garden, attempting the challenge on the final encounter"
*ahem* GETTING the challenge on the final encounter 😉
"people going in blind to a raid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ak3RrawMsco"
"great raid folks, lets get the rest of the challenges done whenever we can!"
damn anmol is probably pissed PC members are even on that Garden list LOL.
Garden list?
in the warmind bot channel.
Lol why would he be mad?
oh heck I'm 8th on the list! Mum get the camera!
oh @Crizum you don't know from my ps4 experiences haha.
he's just the best destiny player ever obviously.
Is he on PC at all? We can do a bridge bulding raid run!
Bring together the disparate portions of our clan
he does have a pc but ps4 is his main.
it's better that way.
*dramatic music*
"@Destiny [PC] ^^ for tomorrow night. i'm fine with taking a couple newbies through if yall are available. but since we'll also be doing one of the encounter challenges, if you've never done it before, please watch a video of the raid so you at least have a general idea of what's going on."
"Did you guys complete the boss challenge last night? I had to step down, I was almost sleeping at my keyboard lol"
yes. so...we will be doing a different challenge. either second or third encounter.
or the first encounter triumph.
Can we do all void classes? I still need that one.
*all spectral blades run*
Just no
sure we can do void that's much easier than arc haha.
idk if i can even do the raid
do you have Shadowkeep?
If you're atleast 940-ish power and have shadowkeep you should be able to do it easy
"@Destiny [PC] Looks like all Nightmare Hunts are up on the moon this week, for anyone who wants to go for the Harbinger title"
I'd be down maybe sunday evening if people want to do those. i'm not after the title but down to help out.
i have shadow keep but im 790 rn
oh haha yeah you gotta be like...935 ish to make it through Garden without any issues.
*ohno*
"I thought we had 1 more reset after this one, but this is the last week before season ends"
I still need a Master NF :derp:
what's your light level? it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought
I ran it with a couple randoms without any comms and we didnt have any problems
just gotta coordinate weapons and mods
https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1201921912516956160?s=20
||**AWWWWW YEAH RETURN OF SAINT-14**||
||LOL FUCK MERCURY||
@Trissin ||***HE RETURNS***||
IM HYPE
I’m as hype as Datto
But I’ll still grind out whatever title they give us lol
||RUSTED LANDS BOYS||
"also, wasn't the reveal stream supposed to start a little bit ago? am I mistaken or something"
Tomorrow same time
Tomorrow at 1
EST
ohhhhh
lol mb
"Hey @thegoaliebear lol check out the exotic scout rifle, bet you're happy to be able to enjoy the Season of Randy"
if that's needed for the seasonal title then everything worked out for me lmao.
i have to be honest i really don't care about saint 14 lol. i just wanna know the seasonal title stuff😂
"spoiler tags
also i welcome more exotic scouts"
"I didn't really have any problem with the scout kills for randy, it was the medals that was frustrating"
it ain't a spoiler if it's on bungie now haha.
"hmm, i guess thats fair lol"
"_Sparrows_
https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1201931479724376065?s=20"
Thats good
good
Maybe we are getting the ||Mercury vendor refresh|| finally
I quite liked the aesthetics of those weapons even though they all felt a bit underpowered
Also the trailer had a criminal lack of ||Sagira||
There's not gonna be a new raid with this expansion right?
No I don't think so
"I don't think I ever actually used the ||Perfect Paradox|| after unlocking it, wonder if it's as good as the hype made it out to be"
It was a go-to for me in y1
well then we can all get Enlightened if there's not a new one😜
*exactly*
I'm stealing that picture
It's mine now
go ahead
Also I'm happy we get to know more about the ||OXA machine||
I used pp all the time in y1. It was a replacement for ep shotty
Is it a slug shotty? Like Chaperone?
"No, rapid fire IIRC"
"perfect, that's my favourite archetype"
"Hey Oath, rank 100 on the season pass for Reach is 117 voice for Firefight, Eternal flame armor effect and the pilot skull helmet"
Can Reach be installed now? I checked in the morning before leaving and there was nothing there
"Yeah, well it installs MCC and Reach is the dlc"
"This is all speculation and stuff, but it seems some people think ||trials might be coming back with season of dawn||"
"I don't think it will happen, but there's discussion of it lol"
||GIVE TRIALS **BUNGO**||
"Also, we can ||change time to save saint-14 but cayde still dead 🤔 ||"
||Or is it just on mercury||
||Think about it: have you ever seen Saint-14 and Cayde in the same room?||
||I mean they are both Exos.........||
@RonInDune reach dropped at noon central
We might be getting more Niobe Labs type puzzles:
"six is one less than half of 14, half of 14 is 7, 7 is the number of columns, destiny 7 confirmed"
wait no I think it means Final fantasy 7 remake confirmed
actually it means that season 7 was the last real season of destiny. everything after is just vex hijinks and our guardian is stuck in simulation for all eternity and activision is using us all as a free source of revenue while we spend all our money on fake eververse items and dlcs
So kinda like the matrix?
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfDawn
The last 4K wallpaper is sweet!
Wish they made some mobiles ones too
||new exotic sidearm??||
"oh crap, I just thought about something"
season of the undying pass gives these perks which boost the rate at which you gain progress for the eriana's vow catalyst
that's gonna be going away right?
"so after season of undying, finishing the catalyst for erianas is gonna be super slow?"
The quest to unlock it at least I think
"yeah, the progress bar"
where strikes give like 0.5% or something
"Gambit give 2 percent, crucible give like 1 percent"
Currently
"yeah and that's with the perks from the season pass, right?"
The season is like a 3x ~ 4x multiplier
I might just buckle up and play like 50 games of gambit prime this week
i wonder what will be the fastest way to do it
still Gambit Prime I think
"Probably momentum control honestly. The matches are way faster, but I'm not sure if they're half the length of a gambit match"
I was thinking about that too
and strikes can be run quickly as well
"but I guess the advantage of gambit prime is you are also sorta farming the gambit weapons/gear, which is rewarding"
I feel like strikes are for sure slowest
not as slow as regular gambit
soooooo
mercury is coming back...
"In real life, we'll back in Mercury in 2025!"
(That's when ESA's bepicolombo mission inserts into Mercury orbit)
well thats cool at least
I wanted to make that joke the whole day and couldn't find a single setup
Sorry for making you my victim
so the Sundial activity is gonna be my new Vex Offensive i'm assuming.
"I'm not as excited as before, but as long as the game's getting content updates I'm good"
I still feel they're still learning from all these mini-DLC/season/what-have-you they've done
"Black armory had good content and puzzles, Opulence had Menagerie, Undying had a good loot progression system, Drifter had ... good lore?"
We're still chasing the high of those first few weeks of Forsaken
"Drifter was definitely the worst of the seasons, and i think it suffered mainly because gambit is just...gambit, and it didn't have a new raid. obviously any season that doesn't include a raid will suffer from lack of that pinnacle endgame."
:(:(:(:(:(
lol. i literally took like 4 weeks off from the game once i got my full notorious set.
said thanks for that suffering i'm gonna fuck off now and wait for the real content.
but i think with the season passes it gives incentive to keep logging in to do bounties. activities like VO and hopefully the Sundial thing will be an easy way to facilitate leveling.
"I kept on during Drifter Season just to get the lore, the IX was a fairly interesting faction. The reckoning arena was beautiful too, it's just the activity itself was kinda meh"
the lore was interesting but not interesting enough to keep me playing that awful season when i could just read it on ishtar hahaha.
true lol
"I think I spent most of the season finishing activities completely unrelated to the season, catching up on Y1 stuff that I hadn't done cause I didn't have the game"
"Finished up most exotic quests, the Mercury stuff, all the Black Armoury questlines"
"Very damning stuff for Season of the Drifter, in retrospect"
Suggestion:
i haven't taken it off of my titan since i got it
It's a very pretty emblem!
"btw, what do y'all think of the new season pass armour?"
sleek as hell.
also...putting on the saint 14 emblem would require me giving up my Guardian aesthetics so...no thanks lol.
but I see potential for another Elsa themed look with that season pass armour lolol.
"Plus with the solar buffs coming up, ||Elsa and Anna|| cosplays are doable"
i agree.
and i think i'm going to make my Titan for a Kristoff kind of vibe.
Excuse me while I attempt to throw together and Anna hunter
no make it Honeymaren @Arixama 😜
think about the ENERGY
But the color palletr
true...the solar colors fit Anna way more.
So they just gave Titan a Warlock helmet with a steel Mohawk and called it a day?
Like you could fit that titan helm to the current vex warlock helmet like a puzzle piece
Wonder if the cash money set will be equally as nice but less derivative
They all have Mohawks because it's saint14 themed?
ironic that for a season partly centered on saint 14 the titan gets the ugliest looking set lmao.
I already have that helmet lol
either that or the destiny universe has discovered punk rock
The titan is front and center isn't it?
"Look at that warlock helmet, now back to the titan helmet. COOL"
the titan helmet is way different ?? if anything the new warlock helmet is the same thing with a mohawk.
Oh my god you are right that is somehow worse hahaha
I thought that was a warlock cape and not a titan mark
But that just means warlocks got the same helmet twice lol
i can't complain because the warlock set still looks good.
the titan helmet looks like a variation of the warlock trials helmet.
so in conclusion: ugly.
That warlock helmet looks 10 times better than the current warlock helm to me
"Lol, the hunter reminds me of blade smith/great hunt a bit"
The mask at least
"hunter set, yet again, is best looking one 😜"
warlock set is clean as well. will be interesting to see how they take shaders lol.
Also that titan is 100% master chief posing
https://tenor.com/view/carter-halo-reach-ship-firing-gif-5990680
It's time.
What shields are in Savathun's Song?
"Mostly void and arc, I believe the wanted enemy is solar but you can ignore them"
wizards are solar aren't they?
in savathun's they're void i think.
"Well the ones near the crystal are void, idk how many other ones there are, I think just the wanted enemy"
"Alright i'll loadout for void/arc, thanks!"
!lfgcreate
separate the words haha
@Destiny [PC]  Looking for 2 Master NF
anyone else need to kill an overlord in Anchor of Light?
!lfg delete 445
dunno if its come up but all nightmare hunts are up right now
Maybe it's permanent since the season is ending?
sweet. which challenge do we think we want to try? maybe the one where only the people with the voltaic buff tether... and that one is at the first encounter right?
"Yeah that’s the first, I’m watching some videos for them, may be able to knock two out depending"
sweet. I'm down for whatever.
"also @Destiny [PC] I'd like to set up a sherpa Garden run for Sunday night, 8:30 EST. I'd like to have the team comp be 3 experienced players and 3 newbies. so if you've never done the raid before and you can commit to that time let me know and I'll set up an lfg post for it!"
and obviously if we only end up with one or two newbies we can fill in experienced players from there. but i know there are still people who haven't done it!
@thegoaliebear I know for a fact that @MrJ and @Snorlax will want to do that
I'm down for sherpa ing if needed
Pay to forward!
@MrJ @Snorlax ^^^^
okay sweet. I'll just make sure that time is good with everyone before i set up a post to get it organized.
"Woah, @RonInDune that wallpaper they are gonna release on the stream"
Wonder what the Empyrean Foundation is
Maybe a dungeon?
"I hope we get good loot from it, the armor ornaments were really cool"
Could just be a different map? Like three maps for the new mode instead of just the one?
"I'm inclined to believe your suggestion of it being a Dungeon. If it related to the Sundial, I'd feel they'd label it as Sundial: Foundation"
Oh god that hunter armor is sweet
Seasons' already worth it with that armor
I'm tempted to buy the empyrean ornaments for hunter + warlock becaues I always forgot to log in and pick them up with bright dust
Enhanced sniper loader is on the artifact
Looks like at least
niceee
lol imagine if it stacked like breach refactor
“The focus this season is on longer range combat”
i know theyre fixing it
That doesn't exist outside of the artifact
but constant pulsewave reload on snipers lol
Enhanced sniper reload
oh wait what
Oh my god haha
"it's not like, an armor mod you unlock?"
Healing orb on precision final blows
Scout rifles season meta??
Convert rose into a sniper
For scouts/pulse/sniper looks like
Enhanced Sniper Rifle reloading on artifact is exclusive to the artifact
WTF IS THAT LAST MOD
PLEASE DON'T HAVE THAT IN PVP
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
Oh man these new mods
MULTI FINISHERS
looks like Randys gonna work out for me after all lmaooo
IS THAT GUILE?!

"Quick, everyone pray for a new area"
"Man, it's crazy how Bungie has mastered teleportation technology. These developers show up out of nowhere..."
"Ok I'm going to stop watching here, I don't want to spoil every new content there is lol"
hah yeah. I'll just figure it out on tuesday.
only then will i find out how miserable the pvp ritual weapon will be.
*500 bow kills*
Can't wait to get *very mad*™️
yeah mood.
bows in pvp? i have to admit im a little bit excited for that
They really like the “throw orbs at things” mechanic
i do like lemon in pvp
unleash the lemon
my quad bow Tomb Raider cosplay loadout will wreck face

ah yes...cant wait for my new activity obsession.
Most Vex Offensive Completion Gold Medal Winner
seriously i NEED an emblem that tracks VO completions.
Time to write a sternly worded letter to Bungo
still waiting on emblem tracking pots destroyed on leviathan
oh dang @Trissin I didn't realize you had Undying already! Great work!
Haha thanks! I picked up randy's on monday evening and that was the last thing I needed for the title
Are you going for it ron?
Nah I never really enjoyed Vex Offensive enough to grind out the weapon kills. I just wanted to fill out my collections
"I do like Randy's quite a bit though, it's a tidy little gun"
"i haven't used it yet, did not like the fact I had to sell my soul to bungie for it"
I think I Stockholm Syndromed myself into enjoying the grind by the end lol
I think I have like 80% accuracy on the Iron Banner scout I used to grind it out
!pvp weapons
lol Talons of the Eagle one tapped people all over the map during Momentum Control
And you can really see the Mountaintop grind in the power weapon slot
holy fuck
Jade Rabbit ftw
jade rabbit has been my goto
Wait what even is Curtain call
Never heard of that hmm
omg that's a y1 cluster rocket lol
used to be the meta
like a looong time ago
"huh interesting, I don't see too many legendary rocket launchers in PvP these"
or even in PvE since the auto reload nerf
"yeah, they aren't very good anymore"
"even vs. riven, grenade launchers are just better"
"Yup, by quite a lot"
"Speaking of raid bosses, anyone want to run 3x Scourge and be extremely disappointed?"
well we have our GoS run tonight and then I'm out until Sunday.
I'll try to lure people into Scourge with promises of guaranteed Anarchy/Fallen Armaments
BTW I started playing Reach and the fact that I can't ADS is really messing with me
Also the crosshair is weirdly low on the screen
You can center it I think?
"I'll have to look that up, I don't know why it's so strange by default. Is it a console thing?"
Best I can tell it’s a rumored Bungie thing?
?_?
Depending on what you trust I guess bullets were shooting below the crosshair in 3 and they couldn’t figure out why so they just lowered the cross hair to compensate and just rolled with it in future games
"Dunno how true it is, but Bungie"
lol that honestly sounds exactly like a software solution so I'm inclined to believe it
if people knew the number of weird bugs I passed off as features I'd never get a job
"I wish Destiny could do some of the stupid game types Halo has haha, the action sack playlist alone makes for stupid fun"
"Played Dino Blasters, all elites with infinite jet packs and concussive blast launchers"
"I just started the campaign yesterday, going to go into PvP after I finish that"
"Also I swear the Covenent spoke English in Halo 2, but they don't in Reach"
"It’s a bit of space magic, Reach takes place before CE so you don’t understand them yet I guess. In the Invasion game type they do speak English when you are playing as the elites"
"hmmm, I remember liking the Reach book even though I don't remember a thing about it now, might read it again now for the lore"
I think the game changed a bit of the lore from the book
anyone for the dungeon i want the ship
I'm down in couple of hours

@thegoaliebear i may be 10-15 minutes late as i have to stop by a store on my way home. if you dont wanna wait feel free to replace me
@RonInDune or @Yeti either of you still available for the raid tonight?
In about 20 mins
perfect/
Just parked getting on son
Soon
great raid tonight got a few challenges cleared
"yup was very frutiful, well done all"
yeah that was awesome.
"@Destiny [PC] ^^ Sunday night I'd like to do a sherpa run for those who haven't done it before. @Snorlax and @MrJ , Yeti mentioned yall would want to do it, so those first two spots you have dibs. i'll need 2 other experienced players to help out with the teaching and so we can pair off with less experienced raiders😄"
Will the raid require *a m m o*
always.
depends on if your a good enough puncher
"I thought this post was for tonight, can't do a raid Sunday night because I have a overwatch Tespa Match from 8-11pm ☹️."
"@thegoaliebear the post says today at 8:30, but the comment/date says Sunday? So Sunday at 8:30 EST?"
yeah if you're on mobile just look at the actual date on the lfg lol.
the date at the bottom never works correctly on mobile.
So it's tonight?
"No it's Sunday, mobile is broken"
no it's Sunday
12/08

"@Destiny [PC] ^^ Sunday night 8:30 EST we will be doing a sherpa Garden run. we have 3 spots for newbies and one more spot for an experienced raider. if you've never done Garden before and can make this, we are happy to take you through!"
Damn that's cool @MrJ !!! Let us know how it goes!

"Bungie's reducing the cost of slotting mods from 5,000 to 500 pog"
Yo that exotic engram change is TIGHT tho
||my previous equinox and vostok don't deserve this||
literally my 2 favourite maps
Guess you'll just have to start doing more private matches 🤔
I better get Anarchy this week before it becomes too easy
"wait so does the season pass include the ""premium battle pass"" for lack of a better term?"
I thought it would be separate from the actual gameplay content
The season pass is the season of dawn paid content and the 100 levels of rewards
ok sweet!
cus i totally would have paid 5 bucks for the tier rewards
Shhhhh
Don't let bungie hear you
Isn't Nothing Left to Say the final mission of the Forsaken campaign?
Wonder if it's a tip for ||Uldren coming back to the tower||
Also all those Mars changes and still no updates to getting the last few nodes
"||If Uldren comes back, Zavala better thundercrash him off||"
*ammo*
the bot agrees
"Alright so after reset, anyone down for grinding out the EP armour on all chars? I think it's doable with 3 people now"
tuesday night i could.
Does Warmind bot have an EP setting?
"it.might. if it doesn't can just select the ""other"" option."
"hmm, not sure about the 12 people limit, but whatever"
We'll spend 6 hours trying to load 12 people into the same instance
can confirm that's how it ~~is~~ was
it's fine. i have an exam that night so i likely won't be back until 8-8:15ish.
yeah time is super flexible anyway
Anyone feel like trying for Anarchy before the patch hits? For bragging rights mostly
when were you thinking @RonInDune ?
"This weekend, evening at any time"
Hmm I'm a bit busy but I will see if I can join
Or any other time really
Depends on whether we can get 6 people
Another chance to get Fallen armaments in always good
Fucking. Finally.
"impressive, congrats!"
"Holy hell Oath, Congratulations!!"
That's incredible!
Richly deserved
@Destiny [PC] ^^ still have room for 3 newbies for a Garden sherpa run on Sunday night
if i were here this weekend i would for sure
"i may have a newbie you can grab, ill ping him at lunch today"
"@thegoaliebear I should be available for that. I can bring my warlock, titan, or hunter depending on what we need"
"@Kimarais/Nick click on the green plus so you join the LFG post, so you make sure to have a spot! 😁"
"sherpa-ing 3 people, quite a ride"
Matos we gotta take you through garden still!

"Oh this is so good:
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48436"
"Interestingly, this is set before Forsaken"
Though I do wonder why ||Osiris called for the Drifter's help and Asher Mir. I assumed Asher Mir is the foremost expert on Vex toher than Osiris himself||
Maybe it's related to ||whatever deal Calus has with the Drifter: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/shadows-cloak-2||
"I know people are going to think I'm insane, but I'm going to replay through curse of osiris' campaign probably tonight if anyone wants to join me"
Perfect time lol
It's so easy to do too
With the release of new light you can replay all the year 1 campaigns if you want.
i wonder if there are any new members who havent played through curse yet? it would be a great opportunity for them to join u
because ngl the campaigns are a bit stale solo
I remember the heroic CoO missions were super short so I grinded the hell out of them for something
we could definitely check. I'd be down to go through those campaigns with new people.
the emblem tracker? 👀
or wait that was heroic adventures
I think it was for lore and the Mercury weapons
You don't have to tell me how stale the campaigns are. I've done the year 1 campaigns so many times
same ahahah
"I unironically love the start of the Red War campaign, it gets dull after we get to Titan"
back when new players had to finish the campaign to access tower and actually do anything
oh yeah I forgot how everything is open to everyone now
sped so many of my friends through the red war lol
"and you also had to hit certain levels to progress the campaign, so tons of public event grinding too lol"
"I still feel like unlocking the Dreamin City legit and slowly unlocking the forges once, is something everyone should do"
"^^
agreed"
dreaming city and forges and stuff are very much worth doing
now thats a lot of public events
bloody hell goalie
let me check something
!rank pe
i thought i was bored of public events
Also Trissin my highest nightfall score is the same Strange Terrain we grinded out together with Ari
i've done a lot of public events but i could never imagine doing *that* many lmao
Ari has got all of us beat lol
oh and sam as well
Looks like Sam hasn't logged in since Shadowkeep?
"yeah, havent seen him in a while"
hope he's doing good!
Yeah me too
Our Raid leaderboard is pretty crazy too
https://warmind.io/rank/325997662715248642/104
"I genuinely don't know who Klaineinthetower is, dunno how I've missed them"
she's on ps4 lmao.
no need to know anyway haha.
Wait why do you have 4 deleted chars??
None of my characters are my original 3 pc characters 😂
Poor guardians
https://tenor.com/3rzM.gif
Will the Master Nightfalls stay at 980 next season?
"1 hunter that I needed lucky pants from the campaign for the ultimate forsaken cowboy look
1 titan to be the sacrifice so I didn't have to have an ass looking warlock
1 ass lookin warlock
1 titan who fell victim to needing to get the Arcadia from the new intro mission"
13?!
ok 13 deleted chars has to be a record lol
What's the Arcadia?
"the ship, right?"
the original ship
i guess you guys don't remember at launch
Yup. You can only get it from doing the intro mission
you could redo the exotic quests and it dropped at a LL upgrade
"so i would level a toon, get mida/rat king etc. transfer and delete"
And we wonder why you hate d2 😂
i did more moon grinding
yea i'm losing steam at lvl 45
for the annual pass?
Yeah the moon grind for exp sucks
trissin challenged me tog et 100
i don't think its happening
how many bounties for a level up?
"off the top of my head, 12-ish"
wait what?? really??
"thats way more than I thought, mb"
"Maybe do the Vex Offensive for grinding as well, to mix it up"
Remember the Eris bounties can be done in Vex Offensive
"pvp bounties that dont involve ability kills are pretty fast, as well as most of the vanguard bounties"
yea i've been bouncing around stuff while working on ritual weapons
"and gambit, i still love gambit"
You're still the Gambit king around here I think
Do you have a ghost with guiding light on it?
You using it?
...yes dad
"@RonInDune still? geez, that's a dusty throne"
or buttkikker maybe
I think @Buttkikker is your closest challenger
Do different characters get the 5 level bonus or is it account based?
Account based
"I might be online later tonight, if you're gonna be on @Matos"
I will be.
"By the way, you can longer earn the Lore – “The Last Days on Kraken Mare” after the end of the season."
It's a pretty cool bit of story and I highly recommend getting it!
"oh damn, okay"
even the lore is going to be retiring with the season?
I'm surprised by that
"yup, along with the shader quests and all that"
https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/48522
"wow, thats a lot more than I expected"
did Shadowkeep bring enough in to take that much stuff out? 🤔
Most definitely not
But they're rotating that out for the season of the dawn content
Its only the lore that's tied to vex offensive thats going away
True but the lore itself has no relation to the vex
It's a vignette from when the darkness came to the system and what happens to the Titan arcologies
It's really good
where do you grab it?
Drops by completing vex offensive bounties
>__________________________>
Especially weekly bounties
gross
"So, anyone down for a Scourge run tonight or tomorrow?"
"Cool, I'll make a post, time flexible"
ok Warmind is broken
I can definitely do one tonight
right let' s try again
oh hey Discord's back
It dies and it lives again
"*That is not dead which can eternal lie.
And with strange aeons even death may die.*"
It works! Hallelujah!
@Destiny [PC] a Scourge run today or tomorrow whenever people are free. Last chance to get Anarchy before it becomes too easy
I could do a run tomorrow night.
!lfg edit description 245
"Yeah tomorrow night works for me too, whenever we can get 6 people"
Tomorrow works better for me
Yeah that's fine then
We should have 6 in that case
!lfg edit time 245
oh hmmm
Gonna speed run the Sherpa raid
well the time is flexible
"Also the Scourge world record is like 6 minutes, so we should be done fast"
Did any groups do a run with the finisher glitch?
@Buttkikker I miss your death bird
Can I get someone to help me troubleshoot something?
All you need to do is test a Discord link for me
having issues on another server I help run and we're having issues loading in
Oh sure I'm down
I got some other participants right now but I appreciate the assistance
Good luck! Discord been a bit fucky today
So Datto put out a subjective ranking of all the available titles:
"Seems fair, though I'd put Reckoner higher due to the sheer amount of grinding required"
I believe the ruleset for that one was less about grinding and more about difficult tasks.
"True, his own ranking was different"
"Reckoner leapfrogged even Unbroken (which I could understand, that's a LOOOONG and difficult at times grind) on Datto's personal list"
Yeah and I agree with with Datto that the one triumph which requires more skill than anything else in the game is Unbroken
Especially with the changes in Glory/freelance mode to make it where it much faster to get to Unbroken
3x Legend is easier with new matchmaking honestly.
"Getting Legend once is by far the most difficult part of the entire game, let alone 3 times"
Reckoner is just pure lengthy torture
But everyone who has Unbroken has done atleast two cllimbs to legend without this season's boosts
I'd say that the freelance mode has helped more
Easier to thrive by yourself if teammates are hard to come by
"True, the solo mode has been a blessing"
(This is the full list Datto made btw)
I wouldn't put reckoner very high tbh. it's literally just tedious grinding and gambit prime/reckoning wasn't great so people literally just did not give a single shit about it.
I'd rank any of the raid titles as the highest tbh.
"Rivensbane is probably the hardest title after Unbroken, imo"
Flawless Last Wish is incredibly difficult
Only beaten by Flawless solo dungeons
because you actually need a skilled team that can pull of flawless raids and challenges. and then I'd put Unbroken along with them.
"For blacksmith, can you go to orbit for the sparrow section and come back in?"
"other than swapping those, I agree with the rest of the list"
and yes you can.
the communities list is way better tbh haha.
okay wait I forgot about this haha. if it fills up then I won't be around for scourge. but if it doesn't then obviously I'll do the scourge runs.
@Kimarais/Nick we have a couple spots open for scourge runs tomorrow night. if the garden sherpa run doesn't fill would you like to join us? we will do the full scourge x1 with x3 at the final boss for Anarchy farm before the drop rate gets buffed lol.
sweet👍 just add yourself to the scourge post so you have a spot!
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/409243455819218975/653342155804508183/Untitled.png
Season 10 spoiler
fill the scourge runs tonight hoes 👀
"btw this was the glitch that happened lmao
https://clips.twitch.tv/WanderingGeniusBaboonSoBayed"
"@Destiny [PC] ^ for the Tuesday reset, might be tough challenges but I’m sure it can happen"
@thegoaliebear i think that it was a glitch cause by the fallen ship? cause it vanished and then the glitch vanished
yeah it could have been. it was wild haha.
"If we get those challenges done then we should plan for a flawless run too, we could all get enlightened at once"
"Yeah, I was thinking that but flawless would be some work so that’s almost like a weekend gig when people have less school/games?"
i'm down to get flawless whenever. i don't have a ton of time tomorrow night or this week to spend on challenge runs but i'm sure we'll be able to get them done.
once i'm on break and recovering from getting the rest of my wisdom teeth out tho...lol...i'll have plenty of time to raid.
Flawless is an all radiance warlock run
what about bubble 😢
"Haha, well it’s anything that can survive so that’s also good"
no hunters allowed
i don't think flawless is as bad as you think lol
"But the more Phoenix protocols the better, who needs to bother with building"
ah. that makes sense
"Oh, the hardest part of flawless? 100% the boss team on third encounter falling down holes"
yeah honestly we have had several runs where we literally do the boss flawlessly as well as that second encounter.
yeah? I actually think it might be the little maze area between the first encounter and the second encounter
if you bring a bunch of warlocks
people gon fall
traversing between encounters will probably be the real flawless killer
"^^
that's what it was for wish and scourge"
yeah tbh any jumping part usually ends up being the most difficult.
"Yeah true, well the good news is if one person makes it and everyone else knows the roles and has decent ammo it’s not bad"
you could also just have everyone leave and rejoin
"Good thing is the first encounter is so quick, that we can practice the the undrgrowrth area a bit"
destiny needs fortnite building mechanics :derp:
everybody should always be ready to alt f4 in an instant
i remember for Crown...jumping from platform to platform had our palms SO sweaty.
Maybe this weekend
If we're not going for the chest then we don't need to take the hard path anyway
If we only need a flawless I could put time in Friday or Sunday
i'd be down to try a flawless run over the weekend. Sunday night is probably best for me yeah. Friday i have an exam and am bringing my stuff home.
Sunday works for me too
"_imagine not being able to alt-f4 before ruining a flawless run_

_~ this post made by PC gang_"
Trissin you have all the flawless raid right?
except garden
And Goalie too
gat damn
i have a lot more respect for goal cuz she did them on ps4
i think it's much harder on console
that is incredible lol
hahaha the cheeks were clenched for sure.
"Now you gotta join us for the flawless Garden then, with the two of you there's no way we can fail"
i'll be there for it haha don't worry.
i am not 100% sure because I've still got more finals left next week
"ah, ok yeah we can wait"
"the thing about flawless activities, they are both so stressful but so fun at the same time"
and everybody plays a bit strangely
I'l buy a 6 pack of red bull to keep me from being too nervous
"""I don't want to be nervous so I'll overload my body on caffeine"" 😂"
"two negatives make a positive, so I'll turn into a super calm machine"
Drink a vodka redbull every flawless failure
how do die from alcohol poising 101
"i'm excited for this now, it's gonna be a lot of fun"
sadly I don't drink alcohol but that's indeed a good suggestion
This thread will be exibhit number 1 in a murder trial
Well if you don't drink alcohol *just don't die*
ooh I totally have enough alcohol for that hahaha.
"just curious @thegoaliebear , did you do your flawless raids on ps4 with our clan members? or did you know other people or LFG a group"
it was all ps4 clan members.
some of the other challenges I did get done with other groups tho. but flawless was always with clanmates.
Has our PC clan attempted a flawless yet trissin?
"I'm wondering if there's interest to flawless scourge, crown, on the pc side of the clan"
"I am yeah, would be nice to get some of the older titles"
I'm down for all of them honestly
It's actually pretty fun
All I'm missing for Shadow are all of the flawless runs
"well there we go, that's a great place to start"
"heroic menagerie and crown are relatively easier compared to something like wish, we could go from there"
I’m down for all flawless. Especially crown
i would love to do any of the y2+ raids flawless
"I don't trust myself for flawless last wish, but hell yeah on the others"
pinging @Matos because I think he would like this kind of stuff too
"I would likely skip out on another flawless Crown...bad memories haha, though it seems there'd be enough interest for that one. but flawless heroic is extremely easy and I'd help out with that."
what??? I actually thought crown was one of the easier ones!!
I dont mean like any offense or anything by that at all
wish we had done crown when we still had unnerfed lunas lol
mountaintop+heavy grenade launchers would have made it so easy
ohhh yeah it is gonna be more difficult now
without auto loading
oh it wasn't because it was hard haha.
"But Ron, we’ve got something better than Luna MT"
Randy’s Xenophage.
https://tenor.com/view/oh-my-george-takei-oh-myy-wink-gif-5296452
Yes I would like this kinda stuff.
Finally something to bring me out from the hole in the ground.
"i don't think we have any raids going tonight ? if not, would anyone want to play gambit? i'd like to try and get that set for my titan for the *aesthetic*"
Did someone say Gambit...?
*maybe*
I need to grind Dredgen and Reckoner so I'd be down
sweet. i should be on around 7:30 tonight.
@thegoaliebear @Matos @Peronix
@Peronix i burn brighter than the sun on mercury 😘
ok I think I found an annoying little bug
"If you're using Borealis or Hard Light, every time you die the element gets reset to void"
"atleast in gambit, not sure about other activities"
I think it's always been like that
in all activities
It's meant to reflect the void you feel in your soul after losing 15 motes
"hmm, it's still kinda frustrating"
"I believe it also happens if you fast travel, join allies, etc"
I killed two people with 15 and 20 motes who were about to deposit with a jotunn shot and I still feel dirty about that
Ooh that's juicy
Minecraft is getting cross play with ps4 tomorrow
Bodes well for destiny
Does PS4 get all the mods?
It'll be the Bedrock edition mods
Can *any* PS4 game be modded? I don't know how consoles work in that sense
"So the Bedrock edition of minecraft has the store where theres like paid mods and stuff. Not anything super robust like Java has, but it's gotta be compatible with console play"
dROnK
does anyone want to join us for some gambit prime?
just got on
I will be back...may have turned my pc off in the most embarrassing way possible brb

"The cabal have crashed time, and the Sundial crashed my PC"
Also I got to Level 7 before I picked up the artifact and I think I wasted a bunch of XP
sounds like fun stuff lmao. I should be home around 7:30 so I'm down to check out new season stuff before the raid/my stream if anyone wants.
@RonInDune I did the same
😢 I thought I was going to get the artifact on level 7
I wasted a ton of bounties plus they said ikora bounties would be removed but they also removed banshee bounties
too clever for my own good
i had a bunch of banshee bounties
The auto rifle is *sexy*
DIM's back
"Fuck,  Hunter finisher and solar emote are so awesome"
I love this gun
||You could say it's *perfect*||
oh oops yeah

"If @LW Mugetsu was killed, would the enemy mugetsued?"
just so i don't pull my hair out doing this solo lmao.
@thegoaliebear how you usin arbalest?
because I want to get this over with asap so I can enjoy Randy's for the rest of the season.
this is my only exception. like i don't think people get just how strongly i feel about pvp and just how much I hate it😂
"What, you mean you don't want to use heavy linear fusion rifles in crucible?"
i think i would rather get hit by a bus.
Let's all use Sleeper Simulant in Crucible only
"Apparently if you get the Calus succ during the final encounter in the Leviathan and get pulled over the barrier, you can use Ballistic slam or Thndercrash to get back in"
Wonder if the warlock phoenix dive would work as well
3 out of 6 essays done. we're out here surviving but not thriving 😂
in one of them we get to choose a real or fictional couple to analyze.
i was like...Korra and Asami...the time has come 👀
"“Elsa and Mara Sov are actually OTP, in this essay I will...”"
Oh hey @RonInDune did you see the dawning ship lore posted on reddit involving ||The guardian that used to be Uldren||? It was pretty depressing 😦
No I don't want to read it yet to not get spoiled
I think you can read it from collections?
"That’s how I read the lore on the sundial weapons, one of them was kinda interesting from a timeline perspective"
hmm I'll give it a look then
I underestimated how frustrating using Arbalest in Crucible would be
that's just because crucible is frustrating in general.
HE'S BACK
THE WEASEL RISES FROM HIS SLUMBER
theFLESHWEASEL thirsts for AMMo
"go into Rumble and see, it's less hectic"
"@Peronix embrace the Arbalest, best of the metas"
@RonInDune I think rumble is highly dependent on skill based match making because every game of rumble i go into is 10x sweatier than comp
like multiple unbroken sweaty
I had a game in Elim yesterday just after the season dropped where everyone other than me was running Not Forgottens
I had 1 kill the entire match
"Their bones shall break upon the king that is Arbalest, all shall tremble before his might"
I felt like a toddler
"Rumble used to be bot central a couple of seasons ago, good to know that's been fixed"
I mean it's all dependent on your skill bracket
at higher MMRs chances are the people playing Rumble won't be AFKing it
Does Rumble have SBMM?
Crucible with the exception of the Control playlist has SBMM
comp is a weird exception though
"there have been matches where I absolutely roll the other team, and other matches where it's like tourney grand finals sweaty"
You may be getting bought forgottens? Or people who paid for recluse/mt who in the system have skill levels similar to yours but in reality they don’t?
Or it’s the SBMM enforcing a close to 50% win ratio?
"That true, elim was fairly low scoring anyway"
comp seems far more volatile with its matchmaking because sometimes ill win 2-3 games in a row and then i can tell I'm facing a whole new set of people all the sudden
"That one match was an exception, around 10 mins after the season just dropped"
"I remember starting to get better when I was grinding close to 2100, felt fair with 50-50 win rates"
"i didn't mind the variation in games as much. with the glory rank changes, it's definitely not as punishing."
I wonder what it’s like to actually try in crucible and lose to memers
Spare Rations/Beloved/Arc Strider out here doing their best only to get an Arbalest to the dome
It just feels so satisfying to shoot though
It does lol
Bungo are absolute masters of gunfeel
"The guns in Reach don't feel quite as amazing, though I do love the DMR and the Needler"
i wonder what it's like to just...try in crucible in the first place.
Painful
"I mean I try, the more I try the faster quests are done"
"Ask @Oathbreaker, our resident Crucible guru"
oh okay. glad it's painful no matter what.
i've just accepted that it's trash and nothing will change that for me lmao.
I mean I enjoy clicking heads in the Crucible
"I do like messing around though, it just feels kinda relaxing"
The less serious I take myself the more fun I have in crucible
And right now it’s peak “everyone is using a bullshit weapon” season
i can resist the urge to fling myself in front of a bus if it means i can reach the point as fast as possible where i don't have to play it for months.
"I'm just extremely competitive, so Crucible can never be fun for me"
Once people are done with the quest and we get back to the stale ass hand cannon hunter  meta I’ll be glad to stay over in Halo for pvp
How was D1 PvP compared to our D2 meta?
i still hated it in d1
Was it as sweaty?
DY1-Y2 was similar. Y3 was a clusterfuck.
What happened in Y3?
Played Rusted Lands and had a lot of fun with it
I just think personally I don’t connect with D2 maps like I did D1
see @Crizum once people are done with the quest i'll be happy to just go back to the good part of the game 😜
It was weird and maybe I’m off base
"But Destiny has a much more vertical play style than Halo, but all the maps seem so much more horizontal if that makes sense?"
Like I’d love some 3-4 level map
Yeah the only map with verticality is that one Nessus map
"Regardless, I enjoy playing PvP a lot because there's nothing like the feeling of absolutely dunking on someone in the Crucible. That, or dropping an absolutely massive game in terms of kills. I don't quite know how to explain it really."
i applaud that because i will always hate it and think it's trash. i'm the exact opposite i think it's stale as hell.
It’s got high peaks and low lows for me
For me it depends on how the matchmaking think I should play
yeah the high of having a rip roaring game in the crucible is amazing
"When I’m dunking I feel amazing, when I’m getting shat on by Unbrokens from on high with MT I want to uninstall"
i think the last time i low key enjoyed things was when i was getting Revoker. sniping is very satisfying and i got pretty decent at running with that play style.
REVOKER
You’ll maybe enjoy Arbalest
i think it'll still be painful for me. but the one shots are satisfying for me.
"Yeah the sniper grind felt nice, I also liked the initial steps of Redrix, it just went on too long"
"This season the quests aren’t as harsh, so I’m having more fun"
i agree. randy's made me so mad lmao.
"I've been using the Sunshot to get solar kills for Lunas, it feels nice"
"D1Y1 and Y2 had much more skill expression in terms of capability of what you could do. With regards to what was going on in the later years was that much more skill-less shit was being buffed, causing things to be less interesting @RonInDune"
because the other ones were so damn quick compared.
oh yeah Oath I remember you talking about a gun that had an rng bullet? that did like high damage randomly?
"but they have to force people into pvp now to at least populate it. which, it still doesn't even work because once people have the newest weapons the only people who stay in it are the pvp no-lifes."
"For me though I've regularly been playing Unbrokens and other incredibly skilled players since about February, so I don't really care what's in the lobby now. I just play."
"and i think that's the issue, crucible legit does not have any longevity for the general population unless you get forced into it for the purpose of a Title/specific weapon quest."
Disagree honestly
"I have no problem playing aginst good people if the team I play with are good as well, then at least I can learn something but usually its me and blueberries vs unbrokens"
"Reason being is that PvE is the same thing over and over again, PvP has variation in who you're playing"
"i mean, once i got Randy's i didn't even look at the crucible section of the game. and lots of other people did the same."
That's because that quest was long and grindy bullshit. It drained any potential enjoyment you might've gotten from the Crucible
"PvE has so many specific challenges within the various activities tho, many of them challenging you to play with certain weapons/classes/etc. with pvp it's like...go use this weapon for x amount of time and then never touch that shit again because there's nothing else to chase after that."
"but i digress, because you enjoy crucible."
and i hate it.
and literally nothing will change that for me lol.
Not disagreeing that there needs to be something more to chase for PvP
"because really, there's nothing at all."
An endgame would be nice for it
"like, i *tried* to find some kind of enjoyment with it, but i literally could not. every game became a matter of ""how long until this garbage is over"" or ""how many more kills until i'm done with this shit?"""
The PvE challenges you do once though and get a triumph. Similar to what you're saying with Crucible
but at least there's an actual endgame in PvE.
"It's similar statements, not quite the *exact* same thing I understand, but it's really similar."
the raid challenges can be tedious at times but there are some that legitimately challenge your team. i can't tell you how many pvp players i've come across that have never even touched a raid in the game.
"The PvP community has been asking for a true PvP endgame for a while now, since Trials got yoinked from the game."
just add trials back in already.
then the sweats can go back on that.
+1 for trials
and we'll get left alone with it lmao.
"Sweats will be everywhere goal, no matter what"
yeah i know lmao.
"pvp is also extremely unwelcoming to new players, which is also why it has no longevity."
"To varying degrees at least. And with trials, there'll be something to direct them."
"I wouldn't say no longevity, but it is pretty rough."
"for the weekend, at least."
With SBMM newer players do have a better intro into the game
Not saying it's perfect
Needs more guidance
"Not disagreeing, but what kind of guidance *should* there be?"
"if you don't have at least something within the meta or a decent roll, you're not going to feel good or encouraged to play it."
Maybe an optional short quest in a private match breaking down how it works/expectations.
"i think that would be better. because right now, at least for new players it's just like, you get your weekly milestone, maybe you try for the ritual weapon because hey, it really isn't *that* bad, but then you never go back to it unless you have to."
"Lots of things are within the meta rn. Additionally, there are some things that won't really be within the meta just due to the nature of how they work (for example, Auto Rifles)"
"without really any tutorial or something to really break down how shit works, it's just like...why am i just getting shit on by all these people with Unbroken and Not Forgotten ?? what even are those ? how do i get them ? what even *is* meta ?"
"Right now, I'm still trying to coax some of my friends who recently started Destiny into trying pvp, but they're too intimidated."
"Also, what goal said."
"I feel like the problem with a pvp endgame is that it will naturally devolve in to one or two builds with maximum cheese potential, everyone will know it’s a problem but nobody will agree on how to fix it"
^^ that too.
Pvp requires more out of a player compared to regular strikes.
"Yeah, again, not disagreeing, just idk how it'll be able to be done."
Won't its flawed presence still be better than its absence?
"i feel like pvp will always be in a state of like, this purgatory kind of thing. where whenever a new update for it or whatever happens, it'll seem great at first but then just reverts back to a few select builds that are annoying as hell and a dead population."
If something is good on pvp it becomes a real problem QUICK
yes that.
A lightning rod
What would you all say the current outliers in general play are?
see @Infernosi personally i am one of those people who legitimately would not notice if they took pvp out of the game entirely lol.
And that's 100% ok.
Maybe they can fix it with the seasonal metas they are trying
Well first things first is they need to remove artifact mods from all forms of PvP.
and that's also part of the problem.
because there are so many players like me who never even give a second thought to pvp.
unless we have to.
"I'd say the big ones, yes. Still on the fence about the smaller ones like enhanced targeting, at least for general play. Would need convincing for them to be in comp/trials."
Enhanced targeting is already in the game
Seasonal mods just cost way less to equip
That's what I was referring to.
"It can cause meta shifts, but I don't know if it'll be too big a problem for high-level play."
yeah i mean the biggest issue is that the exact same weapon/armor pool is available for use within both aspects of the game. and you can't equally balance things to function properly within both realms.
so they have to let one aspect of the game suffer and that will always be the side that's naturally had a much lower player draw.
"Okay, well then tier 4 and 5 only. Leaving things in that break the game in a way from T4 or T5 of the artifact means that the people who complain that PvP is unbalanced as shit should be just as pissed off that the armor mods are active in PvP creating a messy situation."
"Idk, I can see the argument that crucible kept the game alive in some content droughts"
and IIRC that's why they mentioned they would eventually have to drop support for one of the gambit modes?
And they have shown they can adjust weapons separately
"Why would they ""have"" to let some aspects of the game suffer?"
i think the removal of trials was the biggest mistake with it.
"Not dropped support, just not continued updates"
More that they only have so many resources.
"So we wouldn’t get new maps or adjustments for one or the other, but neither are leaving"
I just think they lack a somewhat solid vision currently?
"Fair, but if you shouldn't leave things behind that have been in the game since day 1 because you don't have enough resources budgeted for the game if that makes sense."
"like Rover said, they only have so many resources. naturally, you're going to devote more of those resources to the aspects of the game that pulls the most players. i think they just need to add Trials back regardless of what state they have it in."
"If that happens, there better need to be a damn good reason."
That would be a mistake haha
"Right now, I think crucible team is working on trials, and getting that absolutely perfect, since they have to, and so it feels slow."
"Well maybe not, but I think if it comes out unbalanced and under supported it looks worse than not coming out at all"
They have gotten more active on that front at least.
ehhh...Trials was always a big pull for sweats and even players who just wanted to try out that kind of focused mode.
And it had rewards for every tier of player.
Bit of armor at 5.
Weapons at 7.
Then flawless.
"What about like, random roll guns in the loot pool, but ritual style weapons for higher tier players"
"A trials specific title, not having the weapons tied to the season pass etc"
"as bad as trials was, you could have a clear goal in mind and continue to grind out for it, which in turn promotes getting better at the game and learning maps and all that good shit. whereas with the structure of ritual weapons, it's just like...let me suffer for x amount of time and be done with it."
"and yes, Trials adds room for another Title."
"Depending on the rolls, better players would just try to farm for the god roll. Doesn't solve the issue Crizum"
"Like, sure you got X gun and filled out the badge, but this person went flawless, they can get a gun with every possible scope to choose from, or a larger perk pool"
"i just think Trials promotes a lot of more positive goals players can set for themselves. how it is now, it's just ""do this as quickly as you can and don't touch the mode again until you have to"""
Get nutty and put perks on weapons that don’t normally have them
Something like that would be a good solution Crizum.
"Like a pulse with firing line, is it any good I dunno, but would be interesting and promote team play"
no god no
don't do that roll
then we get S3 meta again
"i'd like to see Trials come back. personally i don't care what state it ends up being in, because i know people will complain about it no matter what, but if they're definitely working on it then it would add a lot of room for more of an ""endgame"" for pvp."
something is better than nothing.
I think this seasons quests are proof they are listening
"The kills and precision shots aren’t an insane amount, a lot of the quest can be completed by your team doing well"
It feels actually reasonable this time around.
"yeah, thank god."
"The weapons aren’t godly, but the quest reflects that"
"They're interesting, unique rolls."
"Sidearm is closer to pinnacle, but tame."
But when do weapon quests correlate to how good a weapon is?
"If that's the case, then Not Forgotten should still be the PvP king bar none."
"Haha, well you got me there"
I do see what you're trying to get at though
"It’s hard again, because if NF IS the king people will naturally want it for PvE, and if it was mostly unattainable (I speak from the perspective of people who don’t have the time/energy to dedicate themselves to getting better, not that it’s impossible) it becomes a salt mine"
"Which I do agree partially with, the more difficult the quest should reflect the better the weapon IMO. That doesn't quite mean that it should be long as hell though"
Divinity felt like a good PvE example of that
"Hard, yet worthwhile."
"Divinity was awesome, an actual quest and not a low drop rate preventing completion of a seal haha"
"And maybe with tuning things in different areas it’ll get better, but I feel like they want the guns to feel consistent, like your guardian is consistent across all aspects of the game"
NF wasn't something people really wanted for PvE though? Other guns out DPS'd. Literally one team that I'm aware of attempted to use it in Last Wish day 1.
So power fantasy PvE runs race first in to “oh I’m not ACTUALLY a god” PvP
"Mountaintop was though, I will concede that."
MT got a class ability and exotic armor nerfed hahaha
"Just played my first game of survival of the season , matching aginst people with not forgotten at 0 glory"
"The new Grenade Launcher from the Tangled shore is pretty good, but MT is in a class of its own"
"Comp, is skill based, not rank based"
The wave based grenade launchers are cool
Martyr’s Retribution Ron?
Well I mean Trissin and I had our area cleared for Crown so fucking quick lmao. We had it done on average a full 20-30s before anyone else before the auto-reload nerfs
They gave everyone thermite grenade haha
i think recluse pulled more pve players into pvp tbh. it's still way more viable and there are a lot of other kinetic weapons you'd rather be using than MT at this point.
Namely Izanagis
idk...i just think the ritual weapons as they are now run into the same issues of leaving pvp without any longevity for players who dislike/just don't play it.
Nothing they do in pvp will make people who don’t like pvp play it though right?
The rituals I don't think should be the form of longevity
Unless they fundamentally change something
Same thing as gambit
"idk how they handle it moving forward, and quite frankly i'm someone who doesn't care. i'll go into the mode when i have to in order to get what i need for a title, and then i'm outta there. but i get there are people who really enjoy it and want to see something good done with it."
"If people don't like it, they won't want to play it"
Which depending on what they change may drive away the core of the Crucible
"the bigger issue is that, yeah."
they're never going to make a full population of people happy. and that's just human nature.
They should just add building and a battle royal mode
"Don't get me wrong, I agree with you guys for a lot of the points your making. I wish there was better ways to improve the PvP experience for some people who don't play it normally."
The learning curve is steep and it requires a lot of prep work to get to a state where you feel competitive I think
Yes and no
CammyCakes just put out an hour long video I'd suggest looking into where he gears up a truly F2P account
CammyCakes is also CammyCakes haha
"Granted, that's Cammy, but it's still doable."
Just takes some dedication.
"That covers gear, not skill/game knowledge."
"I agree with Crizum, it's not noob friendly because it's not just gun play and skill"
Also you need the low tier players to stick around
Need an ecosystem
"i think there will just always be aspects of the game people connect with more as well. i have never connected with pvp to a point where i ever cared about learning maps and what was considered ""meta"" for it. and it'll always be that way for me. and there are a lot more players who simply don't have and don't want to put in the time to learn it."
If there is nobody for the middle to flex on why would they stick around to get flexed on?
"Right, and I'm kinda the inverse of that Goal, which is fine and understandable. Nothing wrong with either side."
"So you end up with people leaving because they don’t get the highs, and so remaining games get sweaty"
And the bottom needs something so they can enjoy themselves.
i think Rover's idea of a tutorial for new players is good ?? like...if you don't know anything then you're not really going to be encouraged to learn such a small aspect of the game when they have literally anything else to play in the game.
"As for preference, I'd say that I play both sides equally, although general pvp is what I do to kill time."
Destiny asks a lot of people I think
I’ve been playing since day 1 and I still don’t understand why Rangefinder on X is godly but a total waste of a slot on Y
"At the end of the day too, I've put in a shitton of time to get better at PvP and understand a bunch about that side of the game"
"a non bs mode could be enjoyable for newcomers and casuals. a mode without sups and without the ohk bs or give the ohk bs to everyone. like every melee is ohk, so a noob wont die to a titan punch then punch the same guy for no dmg"
I don’t think about it too much but from a new player perspective I can see why people get confused and don’t stick with it
Slight flex time I guess
"it does. it's a very vast game that has a lot to learn. and it think that's why newer players always gravitate to the pve side, because they won't be impeded by sweats just wanting to ruin someone's day lol. pve ends up being where newer players can test things out and go on their own for a while."
"Oh, no you totally deserve flex status but that usually breaks down to game and map sense, and eyeballing which encounters are a win"
^^^^ That alone should show how much time I've put in alongside effort
"i mean, okay lol."
Wow I throw a lot lol
and i've hated every single one of those 243 hours.
my win % used to be around 60...then i stopped caring and just prayed to see 100% on whatever quest i had lmao.
@thegoaliebear thats what I do lol
"like i legitimately will not, at any point, thoroughly *enjoy* my time in pvp haha."
That hunter k/d life
Shame time
"but i will say, pvp is easier for me when i'm playing with others."
i will never go into pvp solo at this point. having other people there helps me keep my head haha.
"I do wish that comp had a point after you get everything from it, aside from 3v3 survival"
well now in curious
I'll actually be on around 8:15 now if either of yall wanna play earlier.
I'm always on so I'm down for early despair
sounds like a plan. see you on the other side.
i have prevailed...all 6 essays are done.
"now to look ahead to next semester *looks at schedule* ah, yes...wine appreciation!"
yeah I'll be around
crucible more like CRUcify me amirite
mood
"if anyone would like, i'll be hopping on around 8 EST tomorrow night to finish the crucible emblem quest (at 89%) and finish getting perfect paradox if anyone would want to join."
@Destiny [PC] ^^ ritual weapon stuff for tonight
May I join? I suck tho
"oh yeah haha. I'm at 89% for the PvP emblem, so I'll probs only need a few matches to finish it."
then it'll just be strikes to get the vanguard weapon.
Haha thanks
I'll bring my average pvp skill and my trusty arbalest
I've embraced our new chargy laser boi overlord
I didnt even finish randy's but for comp I'll bring my arbalest too
"lol. it's still awful, but gets to the point of being funny bc that's all people are using."
"I've been farming randy's in control, progress it's so slow omg"
"^^^
I felt that"
I die a bit inside everytime i play pvp
I don't think I'll want to do any comp tonight tho. that was way too sweaty last night tbh. might be worth it to wait a bit until the sweaties get to the higher glory rank.
"It doesn't even matter though, because it's sbmm and not rank"
we had no consistency with our games the other night.
so I will not believe that SBMM actually works in this game lmao.
Remember I was around 300 last season getting matched with people 4500+
Yep @thegoaliebear  tried few matches and it was painful
"I think sbmm works, maybe I just don't play a lot of PvP lol"
I mean I rarely play it and even when I do play comp I have no consistency with the teams I get matched with.
"But most games feel really close, unless I am in a FT with someone significantly better/worse than me"
To me feels most matches are a stomp
one game you have the no life stack of Unbrokens and the next you have people who don't even know what the controls of the game are lol.
its probably  trying to figure out where your supposed to be
that's what I hate about beginning of a new season lol.
but once the population starts dying out after people get the new weapon it gets a little better.
"Yeah, maybe it feels unbalanced because people are just using weapons they are not familiar with for the sake of quests, bounties, etc"
I feel the casual modes like control could be fun if people didnt leave
yeah. leaving is still a big issue.
"""Get kills with grenade in PVP"" always takes me forever and I play horribly because I will always try to get them low, and then throw a nade"
"which like...is hard for Bungie to deal with, because people are always gonna be like that."
see I just don't bother with anything outside of the weapon quests I need for a *PVE*  title haha
I'll get it over with and then go back to the parts of the game I enjoy.
"I might go for this season title, I didnt bother with undying"
I think that's my only gripe with the seasonal titles. I hate having to force myself to get a ritual weapon that I'm never gonna use just because collections count for the title
"the ritual grinds this season feel much more ""ritual"" and less ""pinnacle"""
whereas last season it was like grinding for mountaintop or somthing but randys
Of all of them the MT grind is actually worth it
Such a good gun
"Yep, I still need to grind mountaintop but  well it takes izanagis spot and in the current state izanagi it's almost mandatory for 980's"
yeah thats a big deterrent for getting MT
I'll focus on bounties to get more extra levels because I did 980 nightmare hunt yesterday and boss part was hard
yeah I never bothered with MT.
"I wish I had grinded that after they made it easy, it was an absolute nightmare to do normally"
I did get good with Fighting Lion atleast
tbh im glad i did the hard version
feels like i earned the power
meh...I've been getting along just fine without it lmao.
"True lol, plus with unnerfed lunafactions it almost outdid every other damage source"
never been something you absolutely needed to have for something anyways.
made gambit sooo fun
The gun I really want is Luna's Howl
no definitely optional but good none the less
if I have any opportunity to *not* play crucible then I will.
very fair
I likely wouldn't have gotten recluse if I didn't get hella lucky with the lfg group I found.
"Also, despite the nerf Recluse still feels pretty god honestly"
Though I haven't been using it as much
ive always solo queued for everything because i had noone to play with before this clan
"yeah, it is."
for comp that is
can't say the nerf really decreased its value. thing still shreds aha.
just needs aim now so that OEM recluse is gone
OEM...🙄🙄🙄
and just...any combination in a build that can give you instant health is stupid.
the hunter builds are even more annoying bc you don't even have to get a kill to get health regen.
it's all annoying actually lmao.
That gun looks like it came from the Robocop universe
now the question is should i go for python or enter arbalest the experience tm
Wait a week or for the Arbalest Time ™️
That's when I'll try
well im probably going to get all the rituals this week
there simple enough that i feel its reasonable
for me that is ive got lots of time
literally everyone is using arbalest in PvP now. so...it's not a terrible time to get it over with haha.
lol now to choose between my 22 shottys in the vault
I'm just happy to grind out strikes now haha.
even gambit I can deal with over PvP.
@Buttkikker you having issues with the gambit servers?
"It keeps finding a person, going to load in, and dropping back to 7/8 searching"
no ive not had any issues
are you doing prime or regular?
im doing regular
I was trying regular but I had to go to prime to actually load in
odd

So is Hunter
"*the top 1%*, you mean?"
"Hunters hoard 99% of the wealth, while they have convinced Titans and Warlocks to squabble over the remaining 1%"
Hunters enjoying some Koch
"Hunters are the result of unchecked capitalism, they already had great PvP and PvE builds but continued to amass buffs while closing the loopholes that allowed Titans to rise above the poverty line"
Oh Warlocks got a buff? Tell that to burst glide
When will Bungie establish a socialist society
Hunters just need to acknowledge the inherent privileges they have is all
@thegoaliebear Im sorry but Im gonna have to bail tonight
@Kimarais/Nick i have to play some more pvp for the perfect paradox quest anyway it seems. would you want to help me do that as well?
"If y'all have a spot open, I'm down for some Crucible"
heck yeah.

"@Peronix you did this
https://clips.twitch.tv/FrailRefinedMeatloafKAPOW"
*rawr*
reported
"Yea, sorry @RonInDune. I messed up with that picture"
Here's the correct one
may the gods have mercy on your soul
😂 😂 :travelergoogly:
wait why am I banned
All I've done is turn this clan into a Tony fanclub
"Destiny censors the word ""spicy"", apparently"
You could say it's some *spicy* news
Anyone here ever heard of random rumble? It sounds pretty fun
I have not.
I've seen a few videos on it.
You'd need a group of people to make it work though.
@Destiny [PC] ^^ for tonight if anyone would like to join. doing some strikes to finish the emblem quest. then some gambit to work on the ritual weapon and shader/emblem quest for that.
Python is so nice
Probably the best of this seasons ritual weapons
"Nah, clearly it’s the monstrosity that’s is Buzzard."
I can’t even troll about buzzard being good
Because you can’t use Randy’s with buzzard
"Python is good, but whitespace for grouping, dynamic typing, over reliance on external libraries, etc. are all kinda iffy"
I give that joke a C++
Puns make me stronger
Brainfuck > Python
@Trissin I once set a new years goal to write FizzBuzz in every single language and the first language I tried (alphabetically) was Brainfuck.
Had to get a new New Years resolution after that
"running a normal leviathan run, teaching two people, got two spots open if anyone is interested"
"Sorry, just saw this now! Unfortunately I'm not able to join up rn, did you find people @Avenged ?"
ended up running with some randoms who were chill so we got through it no problem lol
I'm finally free from pvp
I absolutely love that for you.
I may come on my warlock tonight. might be good to drop and extra well outside for the people who are trying to build and kill the goblins with the platforms.
Yeah same
wells and healing rifts everywhere haha.
gonna go with that big brain intellect build.
I would recommend max recovery and lots of stacking minor resists/ arc resists
Phoneix protocol takes care of the regen
I'll see what I end up doing aha. outside people have more of the pressure😂
"but I mean, we were definitely killing a lot of them last time. having the extra wells and healing rifts placed around will help a lot."
"also, maybe thursday or friday evening would people want to try for a flawless GoS? i should be okay to like, talk and stuff by then lol."
I’d be down to try for sure
I'm down too. Need that *shader*
"cool. i think we'll get it pretty easy as far as the encounters go. i'm pretty sure there are ways around jumping stuff like there was for last wish, but i haven't looked into it too much."
"Can you have people complete the encounter, leave and join back in after getting to the next encounter?"
So only one person needs to make it to each encounter?
"not entirely sure I'll be available at those times, but I'll see"
that's correct @Crizum
"The third encounter boss team will need to be flawless, but otherwise I don’t see too many places we’ll have problems with"
"I can't do Friday, will be at a Star Wars screening"
Someone else can take my spot if that's when we do it
"i mean, i'm not in any rush haha. i'm fine doing it over the weekend if people want to and can do that too."
I'd be down for an attempt.
sounds good. tonight we can see what day might work best for majority and i'll make a post for it.
I'll be there around like 8:40 ish.
gay rights!
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to join us for scourge? we will be doing one full run and then x3 at the boss for Anarchy.
I'll join unless someone else desperately wants in.
sounds good we're in VC.
@Oathbreaker do you have the sparrow?
can i hop in for the first half and tag you out for the second?
wait I just realized that Sunday is the first night of Hanukkah I can't do a raid then haha. could people do Saturday for an attempt at flawless instead? we can start later or whatever if needed.
I can make it work yeah
okay awesome.
just means we'll get Enlightened a day early then😜
Enlightened for the Festival of Light. how fitting.
https://old.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/ebg4o8/telesto_again_with_the_new_seasonal_arc_mod/
I'll be on tomorrow night to work on the gambit ritual weapon if people wanna join. won't be able to talk too much tho aha.
"I've been meaning to learn Python for a while, so sure"
@Destiny [PC] ^^ for tonight. just chillin' since i can't talk that much lol.
what's the gambit ritual weapon again?
C++
Hulk Hogan’s arms
a shotgun i think it's called Python.
time to go triple shotgun and make all my teammates extremely mad
So much cabal oil...no ether cane in sight
"@Destiny [PC] The EDZ obelisk is bugged out, you can sometimes get it to work by hitting orbit and dropping back down"
Bugs? In destiny 2? impossible...
"I know, hard to believe given the track record"
*it's a feature*
"Speaking of, you can apparently team kill with Symmetry"
"On a totally unrelated note, you wanna play some PvP @Crizum"
"No, because"
I’ll do gambit though
hey fam so I won't be on tonight for gambit after all sorry. just not feeling too well today.
"'s all good, take care of yourself!"
I'll probably just plan on coming back Friday. days 2 and 3 of recov are the worst haha.
need to make sure I'm ready for that flawless on Saturday lol.
i just
why
hot damn buttkikker
he truly be out here kicking butts
you mean kicking ****
a true god
three kills with one handheld super nova because why not like wtf they all doin there
"anyone seen this? friend talked to rahool and this spawned in his arms, and he can't drop it"
"Looks like one of the dawning decorations, no idea why he wouldn’t be able to drop it"
PvP right now:
horrifying
:02think:
Are you having issues in Crucible? Do you find yourself dying over and over to Arbalests? I have the solution for YOU!
What exactly should I imagine my first game of Crucible to be like tonight? :thinking:
Pain
darn
depression.
the animated emoji you used in that message is actually the perfect representation of how you feel during crucible now.
that makes me more interested actually
"you will be like ""wtf"" at first and then gradually just fall apart as you keep playing it."
Fucking bungie made you go into crucible or gambit for the 2nd part of the saint 14 quest. I went an entire season without doing either and I was perfectly fine with that.
It's literally 25 defeats and scorched is up
Like it's so easy and actually fun pvp
"True, but I still don't like being forced into a pvp activity to progress a pve story line."
I still haven't finished the s14 quest lol.
i was convinced by shaxx's speech the first time i talked to him
oh and it's part of a quest i have i think?
not sure.
"Crucible has its highs and lows, it’s not in the best place currently according to various people but I dunno what they can do about it"
"I’m not a huge fan, I just hate it less than you all do haha"
"as long as people play it, right?"
I've just accepted that it's bad but I'll still hate it just as much whenever I'm forced into it for a quest.
You play any other mmo’s?
FFXIV
I haven't enjoyed pvp for quite a long time
"Haha nice, so imagine if the only way to get coil/Alex/omega weapons was to take a side trip in to the various pvp modes"
bruh.
then the pvp should be managable.
:sweats:
"I don't enjoy being forced into PvP for a title centered around pve. but I get why they have to do it. and overall, the amount of time I'll spend in PvP compared to sundial and other activities that are actually fun for me is pretty minimal."
Plus any mode loses its fun when you grind it to hell and back
depends on how much you like the mode
"I really enjoy do strikes, raids, and other pve but the pvp aspect of destiny just hasn't been enjoyable for me for awhile."
"I will never play PvP solo at this point lmao. when I tried playing solo for some quests it got to the point where I was literally leaving matches on occasions bc it got so unenjoyable for me, which is something I never did."
How long does a match of Crucible last?
"10 minutes at most, depending on the mode and other factors"
time to see how nice or bad it is :peepohappy:
sending prayers.
Friends are always helpful if you do need to grind it out
"Honestly you might end up liking it, I'm terrible and I still occasionally find PvP quite fun"
There's nothing quite like destiny
I honestly have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing in this game this season lmao.
's was very nice
any season that drops when I have a ton of shit going on and now that I'm home for break just never registers with me lol.
Write Saint 14 fanfic
"I haven't played much either, just the first day and the raid night"
same.
Anyone want to help me run a friend through normal leviathian semi blind?
I'm down @Infernosi
is it the leviathan raid you need to do for a quest?
I can yeah
i have that quest as well. could i tag along?
👼
"Should I make a new server, or just invite my friend into this server?"
"Also goal, this season the goal seems to be leveling up those things on the various planets"
They are like mini-chalices of opulence
They also have decent mods attached to them
@Infernosi invite them here that's fine.
"The more you upgrade, along with season pass levels, the quicker it is to farm rolls on the saint-14 weapons, some of which are pretty good"
yeah it seemed like those obelisk things were the focus. I just wish it didn't take so damn much to level them lmao.
"yeah, there four planets and each one maxes out at 11"
"Ok, we're in raid - alpha channel"
So it's 200 of the materials per level times 4
what is the quickest way to farm those things.
Some of them when you level up you get extra drops in whatever activity
"The weekly bounties get you 100 each, triumphs you some and you get more per level of the triumph"
"two bounties per obelisk, you can get them on each character if you are crazy"
okay. I remember the bounties weren't that bad. is there also a different sundial boss this week?
"@thegoaliebear If we want to get a 6th from lfg, what do we do?"
ik you can start a DM voice call with everyone if you're all friends but if it's easier I'm fine with them joining the server for the time being.
birthing fluid = cabal milk

"I remember the ~~good~~ old days of Leviathan. What fun, right @thegoaliebear ?"
year 1 was a dark time.
how Levi going fam.
Just finished
Finally got a midnight coup
Calus took 3 runs I think
Same as gauntlet
:peepohappy:
We should plan a prestige Levi run for those who still need the quest to be done
nice. i wish they brought midnight coup forward to have mods. i love using that gun.
Last time I ran PLevi was before Forsaken and we didn't have Well and I spent most of the time dying or dead
https://i.imgur.com/6Irghiy.mp4
Midnight coup is the only thing I'm missing from leviathan raids on my warlock
such a good gun
lmaooo i just ugly laughed at that gif.
guess i will be the only person to say that the pvp is really enjoyable :p
I commend you for that.
You're not the only one
I play a shitton
Same here for the most part
Agreed sasch!
what is this slander.

@Oathbreaker @Trissin
Alright then
Let's go
Let's go get ourselves a 2 man Riven
"I don't think the damage would be there, honestly"
y'all got this!
It'd probably be easier to do the actual 2 man strat
don't forget to stream though
bleh
Fighting a cold right now so even if I wanted to do it
just use ASL
besides I'd have to be Tractor Bitch because I don't have swords LOL
No swords!!1!! How could you!
They're a type of weapon that have too much risk for not enough reward on average
Outliers of Crown and now this I'd say
Everywhere else there's better options IMO
I watched some youtube tutorials and started using swords in comp to corner peek
Went extremely poorly
just emote
don't need a sword to do that
if you're gonna 3 peek either emote or use your class ability to do so
Every class can move their mouse around in 3rd person mid animation
"I try not to emote cause that's a clear giveaway, but the ability use is a great idea"
we love that. just reminding it's Saturday now tho.
let's get that bread!
Just realized I haven't had spike grenades selected on my Swarm in god knows how long:derp:
"Oh man as much as I love D2, Halo: Reach's storytelling is way better"
The way that ||Kat|| just dies hits me way harder than even Cayde
I eagerly await your impressions of the ending.
You haven’t been spoiled on it have you?
not the exact details no
Okay good haha
"I still can't believe ||Kat's permanently dead, just like that. Not even a heroic sacrifice. Just dead.||"
Big oof
"Side note since you are past it, that mission where ||you fly the hornet and Kat is mission support, Buck from ODST can show up, played by Cayde himself||"
oh man I never noticed
Will ODST be a part of the MCC?
It is yeah
Nice! I've heard good things about that one
It’ll be last on pc since they are doing chronological order
Unless ODST was pre halo 3? I’m timeline fuzzy it’s been so long
Interesting!
Chronologically ODST occurs during 2 and just before 3
"I just realized, Reach is set before all the games, right? So it doesn't spoil anything if this is the first game I play"
"Just picked up the MCC, never played a Halo game before."
Reach is the first game in the series in chronological order
"Also, playing Heroic?"
I believe Bungies line was always about Heroic being their intended difficulty
Or the baseline they adjusted up and down from
I used to play halo religiously when bungie was still owned by Microsoft. Beat all of them solo legendary which on some of them was a bitch.
Oh no I'm on Normal now lol
I started on Heroic and some of those Elites were functionally impossible to kill
I would empty the entire clip to take out the shield and it would regen by the time could shoot them again
"Yeah, on legendary I had to abuse the noob combo"
If you are using an assault rifle stop lol
"Pillar of autumn on halo ce was by far the hardest mission out of 1,2, or3."
The plasma pistol overcharge+DMR
huh I'll try that that
The DMR is soo good
Basically what scout rifles should be
"It was kinda a proto-scout, maybe I’m misremembering cause old but scouts in D1 were not what they are now"
Wait is the Assault Rifle bad? It's what I use the most
I almost never used the ar
The assault rifle is kinda the starter weapon
"Pistol in Halo 1, battle rifle in Halo 2 and 3"
"Oath can probably elaborate better than I can, but fundamentally Halo pvp was about map and weapon control, and AR starts meant you would pick up more of what was placed on the map weapon wise"
"You’d control weapon spawns as they were on a timer, and a good team would always wreck once you got rolling"
"Yeah I played a couple of rounds of the mode that was sniper only, no radar and the birthday sounds everytime you headshot"
I had a blast!
Battle rifle was a 4 shot headshot
"DMR’s, and previously BR’s are multi-purpose weapons, they weren’t too OP but they allowed skilled players to have a chance against people with more powerful weapons"
Battle rifle isn't in reach at all right?
Is it like a pulse?
"Naw, think of BR’s kinda like pulses I guess?"
3 shot bursts
Also playing reach again my first thought on grenades was “Everyone has Fastball slotted”
"https://youtu.be/d1cKn8DAbPg

This is a video of gameplay from me in Halo 3"
I’m a cursed halo player
Good example of what map control and a br can do
"I have like 30 betrayals tracked in Reach so far, only like one intentional"
"You name it I’ve betrayed with it, I don’t know how"
I betrayed with a mongoose once
Teammates in the wrong place at the wrong time lead to crazy betrayals
Had someone cheat by teleporting and going invisible in *Scorched*
WHy would you cheat in *Scorched*
I can't even say that's sad. that's just so ridiculously funny.
"He's getting some burnt edge transits for Christmas, that's for sure"
this just happened in my orgs group chat I'm DECEASED
Lol. Go slide in like booty oil. That is amazing
that line literally killed me.
I ugly laughed out loud.
very smooth
like booty oil
At least he didn’t say like *cabal birthing oil* right @Peronix?
Some nice *birthing fluid* to moisturize the skin
oh god I could say something really bad but I will RESTRAIN myself.
*do it*
***Y E S***
Ron's innocent eyes must be spared.
👼🏽
@Peronix ||sliding into the DMs the way I'll slide into the maker of the birthing fluid||
Ron if you click that it's your own fault.
I am a pure angel and I would never fall into the temptation of click
oh my
i warned you.
There's only so much a warning can do
i said it would be really bad.
curiosity killed the cat.
||Can’t believe you just called me a pussy||
Holy shit @Crizum the ending of Reach was *awesome*
I got literal chills at ||objective: survive||
One of the best game endings I've ever played
so good
Why are we all playing Destiny and Halo when Team Sonic Racing exists
"Btw, thanks @RonInDune your excitement convinced me to buy the Halo Collection"
reach is the best halo game
prove me wrong
||Do y'all think the decorations around Saint-14 are a hint that Trials is about to come back?||
"||His story did mention something about knowing what to do now that he is back, it would make some sense if it became Trials of Saint-14 and he was a permanent tower presence||"
Wait shit would that mean ||some of the secret triumphs needed for the Savior title would be trials related?||
"No, I don't think that will be the case"
Hope not haha
I know at least one will be for an exotic quest
The ||laser beam sidearm||?
Either that or ||the kinetic fusion rifle||
||wait that's going to be kinetic????||
"I believe so, may be remembering wrong but someone data mined something"
||there's are some places that show the hidden triumphs and none of them are trials||
||also yes it kinetic||
"|| This exotic fusion rifle has the unique perk Saint’s Fists, which allows the weapon to be charged to fire three spreads of kinetic slugs. It also contains the perk Breakthrough, which allows it to partially bypass enemies’ elemental shields.||"
gonna be streaming and doing some sundial stuff at 915 if anyone wants to join. i still have no idea what i'm doing this season lmao.
Saving the headbutting teddy bear and afking in forges
That’s the season
Actually this season is pretty good
https://twitter.com/DnDestinyInfo/status/1208385628578238464?s=09
That should be a raid challenge
we ready to be enlightened tonight or what.
"I still have, like, 4 challenges to do:reeeee: 

But I am ready to flawlessly whoop Vex ass"
well we got the most annoying one out of the way haha.
Best not to mention it; Crizum and Ron may have flashbacks to that tumultuous time
Math is just hard ok
Turns out that grouping Vex like sheep is a difficult and time-consuming process
guardians turned into Vex herders.
is that what retirement is.
the *worst* retirement plan
Its what Osiris is doing
He's herding Saint XIV's
He gets lonely
he just wanted his mans back😩
"Honestly, I didn't expect Saint XIV to be so wholesome, but I love him"
when I first walked up to him he was feeding his pigeons and I was just like...I love this man.
I guess if you go up to him wearing the helm of saint-14 he laughs and says you and him should go confuse Zavala
"Saint-14: 
Me:"
I can't imagine Bungie would take him away at the end of the season
they better not.
"Turns out Destiny was a sci-Fi soap opera this whole time, and the current Saint XIV is actually the ***evil*** version, Saint 41.

Osiris was a puppet master all along, pulling our strings in an attempt to strengthen his hold on Mercury’s reality. He is the new king. All praise Osiris"
"At the end of the season, Saint 41 will be put down, but Osiris’ grip on Mercury will stay tightened, since we killed the only opposition: the Flayers.

Out of options, the Vanguard turn to their last resort: Colonel"
Colonel and the flock of pigeons.
"Well...you see...Osiris has a weakness for chicken pot pie, and Colonel fits the description of a chicken..."
https://twitter.com/chalcoyong/status/1208184342771421184
"More like “shit we don’t have any more carpets with XIV on them, he likes Osiris right? Cool”"
So uh we're playing matchmaker/Cupid
Huh?
Oh god is this a shipping thing
yuuuuuup
hell yeah.
The true end game is *romance*
what would their ship name be tho.
Listen the only person Osiris would even remotely deserve is Ashir and that’s because I fucking hate Ashir
How dare you speak blasphemy of God-King Osiris
"Also, why is there a drifter emote in the season pass"
Padding
Also because you all know in your hearts the true ship is SaintXDrifter
"It's MeXDrifter, excuse you"
DrifterxShinMalphur is the OTP
yesss.
Some of fanart those two get is ... ...
big oofs
love that hahaha.
Mara/Sjur and Drifter/Shin are *very* popular
hell yeah. the lore between mara and sjur is so soft a lot of times.
https://daxtri.tumblr.com/post/188654707532/wish-ender
*s o f t*
I ship warlocks with good looking armor
TOO BAD BUNGIE HATES THAT SHIP
I...I like warlock armor
*This post brought to you by Promethium Spurs*
"Hey, Hunters had to suffer from toe armor back in Y1, y'all get to suffer the same"
Man the Awoken lore books are soo good
or even
we love girlfriends.
Mara daydreaming about Sjur. *soft as hell*
"I keep seeing Netflix ads for a ""Tall Girl"" show"
I think Mara would've loved it
@Crizum @Peronix @RonInDune @LW Mugetsu @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 8:30-8:45 ish EST still good for yall tonight?
yes ma'am
Yeah I’m good whenever
I’ll be around all day
sweet. i will probs be closer to 8:45.
"The season pass armor from 40-whatever is insane. Had righteous strides given to me with 81 base stats, no masterwork"
?????????
Got these from the season pass
"Had to masterwork it myself, though"
those are a 103 total roll
Aren't those base 66s? 93-12-10-5
"Yeah, base 66"
"Oh wait, that's why"
"Still, really damn good"
The season pass armor is a high stat roll though
I forgot mods added to total
Better than some low roll raid gear haha
well i know my end game armor...
Don't forget about +10 hidden from Traction
"wait, it might be +5?"
I think traction is listed 5 hidden 5
It's total 15 from memory
+5 seen and +10 hidden I heard
It’s honestly wild how bad controllers feel without traction once you have it
"Mobility now actually feels like a useful stat to me, at least on Hunter"
I want to be able to spec a little more into it now but we'll see
Kinda sucks they tied titan to a stat you want to get like 50 in and stop
Barricade isn't *super* useful for the most part anyways IMO
Resilience does need a reason to invest into aside from ttk shifts.
Doesn't even shift TTK
"In PvP nothing is as useful as dodge, but at least points in recovery aren’t throwing"
It's the only thing you can use in combat
Still an animation lock
You *can* make some silly plays with barricades
Healing rift once set up is really nice with cover play.
anyone have NBA 2k20?
it's currently 29.99 on steam and I really enjoyed the MyCareer part of it and I've read multiplayer is absolutely awful for PC lol so figured since I don't play that 50% off might be worth it.
just wondering if anyone has any experience with it.
Flawless looking that rough?
The game doesn’t want it to happen
We weren’t able to use any tethers
Rip
lots of us are lagging for each other lol.
"if the game is having issues then yeah, it won't happen tonight haha."
!lfg edit 110 time
!lfg edit time 110
oh man I feel bad for how bad that went
we'll get it tomorrow or die trying!
no worries. we have it down. we will get it nicely tomorrow coming back at it fresh.
i also just bought nba 2k20 i am trash :)))
i made the mistake of starting this download at 1am lmao.
Is the download *thiccy iccy*
lmaoooo.
but yeah it's like a 50GB game so it's pretty hefty. I'll just do it tomorrow instead haha.
Ron tell your game not to crash tonight. give it love and affection so it knows you value it.
anyone who wants to do some crucible games in a half hour or so?
What are you thinking?
I only did control so far but I don't mind other modes
Goal my galaxy brain take is to lower the house temperature by 15 degrees so that my laptop doesn't overheat anymore
that is so smart.
Just set your laptop up on a box fan
I have it on a laptop cooling pad already
Might put some icepacks below
@sasch You still looking to pvp?
o yes
were u waiting? sorry
You're good
"So apparently my key mold did work, so I should have Izanagis in two days when the other two forges open up"
i died in literally the last 2 seconds of having a completely flawless sundia;
Big ooof
Next season: the Oofdial
The moodagerie
guys I'm gonna need around 10 minutes
I'm ready whenever btw
we are all on now.
How's it going???
"Pain. Loss. Defeat. These are what build us. Yet, I feel so broken"
I hate myself lol
it's so close and yet so far
The dog is a supplicant and the cat is boss team

ye that's xcom for ya
"Yea, she died"
Season of the Furry confirmed?
uh oh..
Don't forget Vegeta on a cheetah and Spock on a cock.
2k20 is good fam I'm glad I got it. giving me those mental breaks in between our flawless attempts😂
I've been playing Transistor to get my head back in order
How have those flawless attempts been going so far??
16 attempts so far
I heard there was some trouble with the applicants
Supplicants omg
"We had the boss to half health once, but then my game crashed"
noo!!!! That sucks!!!!
sorry to hear that
I hope you guys get it!!
"We'll get it or die trying, that's what I always say"
"I don't mean to take anyone's spot or anything, but give me a shout if you need one too lol. Would love to do a flawless with the clan :))"
lol yeah if I keep failing miserably I'll offer my spot to you
ah I'm sure you're okay Ron!
we also just had quite a few attempts ruined by the game literally not working😂
I hate that
~~i mean what am I saying the game is perfect~~
:(( that's real frustrating
but we'll get it. I just like to step away from the game in between attempts anyway. not make myself crazy over it.
I can't wait to fight the Santa raid boss tonight tbh
there's one?
Depends on if you find an old man in your house at midnight tonight
that's gonna be a strike playlist worth of them
"C a l u s = claus. No e, because Calus is straight edge"
You've given me an epiphany
the frog from Flushed Away is literally Calus
glad I could provide.
it's so true tho.
His chalice is filled with tears of joy from guardians participating in Menagerie
The story of menagarie is actually Calus wanting friends to play with
"That damn chalice, I still need 4.5k imperials to complete mine"
All of that just for one catalyst smh
Are you and/or your friend down to run through Shattered Throne for Izanagis @Crizum ?
"I can hop on, he finished it already apparently haha"
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ef0qz0/no_red_hive_armor_in_shadowkeep/
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
I have achieved...*optimal dps*
so now we should one-phase that third encounter right.
we will leave no extra phases that could potentially lead to someone dying lol.
But we’ve never wiped on the third encounter
Ever
Get the catalyst ASAP
"It's fairly easy to do these days, I think Eso has already solo-ed heroic menagerie"
i'll be on tomorrow night just doing sundial stuff. around 9:30 EST if anyone wants to join then lmk.
I'll join you if I'm free then. Not quite sure about my schedule tomorrow evening.
alright sweet.
My wife's family is suddenly coming over tomorrow when we have their family Christmas planned for Saturday so I will *definitely* take that escape
hahaha well all we do on Christmas is see a movie and eat chinese food so. i'll be available 😂
Enjoy Cats!
"Cats v2.0, now with patched graphics"
Cats: Enhanced Edition
Cats Next
Cats: A Realm Reborn
Re:Cats
Cats-I didn’t know Bethesda started making movies
"Cats: wait, i'm actually in the Frozen 2 theater how did i get here i wonder ??"
I was gunna do Cats (2019) but that's just what it is
"Frozen 2, but with the VA's faces awkwardly photoshopped onto horrifying snowmen"
Neon Genesis Catvangelion 3.3 You Should (Not) Watch
:squint:
Nekoasuka
"oh man Thawxterm adviced me to watch Evangelion on Netflix, it just got too weird for me after a bit lol"
hahaha wild.
Evangelion is a classic 👌
All I remember was everyone was very depressed and/or alcholic
too real
I mean...that's an entire mood.
Can't wait to purrrrchase tickets to all of these enhanced Cats movies
It's the cinematic equivalent of visiting the Mountains of Madness
As is reading your puns
Has anyone heard the Saint XIV line about how beautiful Ada-1's voice is?
I suspect he plays for both teams
I don’t even think there was any indication of his sexuality anywhere?
As if that has ever stopped anyone
Who at Bungie thought of the 25 scout rifle final blows step in the Iron Banner quest and who hurt them
"Oh, 10 rocket launcher kills as the last step"
***M E R R Y C H R Y S L E R***
@thegoaliebear I'll probably be around for some sundial runs
I mean if I dont kill myself after trying 10 rocket launcher kills in iron banner
"I'm down as well, though me and Osiris have some beef with all these Steelfeather Repeater rolls"
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 Good luck soidier
Thank you
@Peronix do you have a fully upgraded chalice to get burdens catalyst?
I'll probably complete mine today then I might have couple guys to help us get it
I need some luck with wealth of the emperor tho
"I could join for sundial, you lot mean the thing you do for Osiris?"
I do @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
"Cool, I'll keep grinding iron banner for the imperial drops I need. I'll let you know"
@sasch yeah the new seasonal activity.
"okay well, I'll be on around 9:30, so yall will just see me in the VC chillin then."
Would recommend truth or wardcliff for rocket launcher kills btw!
I need to know the t r u t h behind that quest step
I didn't even know iron banner was a thing lul.
"Yep. This season's Iron Banner lives up to the name, requiring a heart of iron to play"
love to hear that. can't wait to do sundial runs.
Maybe you can surpass the amount of vex you killed in Vex Offensive
"I might have to given that u get like, 10 fractaline things after one run when u have to level those things like 73 times😂"
"If it wasn't the 4 pinnacles I wouldn't touch iron banner, but well got a light level in exchange of my will to live"
"966 now and I only did 100k this week, so quite a few more pinnacles to get"
You can level those obelisks super quick if you do all the Saint daily bounties and obelisk bounties. I already got all of them to 11
yeah but see. I don't got time for that.
This is also valid
I haven't played the game outside our flawless attempts now lmao. I ain't gonna burn myself out on the game the way I did during forsaken.
"I still need quite a few fractalines but Im not in a hurry. I've mars and edz done, tangled it's lvl 9 I think and I didnt level nessus at all."
i think i'm done with the triumph for leveling the tangled shore one. i just haven't bothered rn lol.
getting some new emotes made...only 3 away from 35 sub points which gets a new emote slot :goal_finger_guns:

:thonk:
im going crazy https://prnt.sc/qfpog4
lmaooo rip.
yeah ive more wealth of emperor but it just doesnt drop lmao

uh Where is the best spot to find a Cabal Champion quickly?
Like an orange bar?
for a Saint XIV bounty
It says Defeat a Cabal Champion
"Load in to normal leviathan and see if those count, if not try any cabal public event"
Public events didn't work
lost sectors didn't either
"I think it means champions from the infinite forest, cause I killed a lost sector cabal and it didnt count"
And the description said something about the Infinite Forest
huh alright I ;ll try that thanks
I thought it was a unstoppable/barrier champion
Sundial was where I got mine
"You know, that'd make more sense"
can't wait to be depressed with yall again tonight:travelergoogly:  but I still believe.
Did we decide on the same time as last time?
yeah. I'll probably be on around 9:15. so same time.
Alright great

yay got it and completed izanagi's catalyst
so we're one phasing everything tonight is what I'm hearing.
"That’s up to @Peronix, gotta finish that catalyst"
Can't finished what you haven't started:derp:
Catalyst takes around 30~45 minutes to complete
Ye but I got to do flawless heroic menagerie
"Not flawless, just the heroic"
With a completed Chalice
Oh. Anyone down to do heroic?
i should be able to hop on around 8:45. doesn't take that long. if people want to do a run for it then.
"But don't worry guys I got my Retold Tale, so we'll still one-phase everything without it"
I found the new meta
big brain.
pair with revoker and edge transit for ez wins
we're getting too advanced here.
3 metas ahead
Can you imagine if they stealth rolled out random roll leviathan weapons one season?
I was sure they were gonna do it during Opulence
i wonder which ones would keep up with the meta
i want to have mods on my midnight coup. ugh.
what mod would you choose
"1. Midnight Coup
2. Midnight Coup
3. Midnight Coup
4. Mob Justice"
_inaugural address would like to have a word with you_
Inaugural Address is a laser
Carried me through Shattered Throne so many times
I would agree *if I had it*
git gud n00b
it would be nice for the anti-barrier/overload/unstoppable mods they have.
i know alot of people still use alone as a god for pvp
I love the scope on Alone as a God
Alone as a god is a beast
"A *god* in PvP, you may say"
booo

anyone fancying some crucible?

So D2 is already one of the top seller on Steam for the whole year

"Good luck tonight all, hoping you pull out the W"
Bungie kinda has two games in the top of the 100k+ concurrent players category
Yup Reach and D2
Amazing
Capcom not doing bad either
I'm running bounties and am ready whenever
@Peronix good to go soon?
What's a lost sector with a large number of Cabal?
The Nessus one?
That or Mars
"Yeah, go to the one in Cistern"
@Peronix resurrect yourself.
"Sorry guys, had a family emergency pop up a while ago and haven’t been able to reach my phone. Is someone around to take my spot?"
@Peronix no worries. we will put it off for another day. don't want to do it without you. hope all is okay.
when might be another good time for people then?
I can do tomorrow
gehsundheit
I guess you died
@Destiny [PC] would anyone want to do a quick regular garden run? with all void subclass for the challenge.
Need 1 more counting Ron
@RonInDune you want to try and 5 man what we can?
sure what can possibly go wrong there
@Arixama any interest in a regular garden run? all void.
@Peronix if it makes you feel better destiny *HATES* ron tonight
it's consolation for our dumb asses.
@Trissin if Ron gets booted again would you want to finish garden with us?
"oh no, that sounds rough"
"I could sub in for him if needed, sure"
saaaave ussss
@Trissin you can come in now
"okay, give me one min"
Sounds like you guys are having fun...
"""""""""""fun"""""""""""
https://clips.twitch.tv/InnocentHealthyDadM4xHeh
so twitch was saying i was getting these huge bitrate drops during stream but going over the video they were never super terrible. like sometimes they used to be insanely pixelated but now it never got to that point lol.
so switching the encoding to my GPU and raising my overall bitrate did work 😂
"Oh shit, what happened to Ron @Arixama 
And yea, NVENC encoding works best if you have a 1660/20xx card, since they have their own dedicated CUDA cores to work with"
Anyone fancy doing clanmate bounties tonight?
"I got one for doing a raid, crucible and gambit(iirc); are the ones everyone get the same or does everyone get different ones each week?"
They're the same for everyone. What time were you thinking?
"8-9 hours from now would work for me
i get home ~3pm EST from work but i can play the whole evening considering it is weekend"
@Peronix @Crizum @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @RonInDune @LW Mugetsu so did we want to try a flawless run tonight? I'm totally good with waiting more if needed. but I'd be free tonight too.
"I shouldn't have anything come up tonight, so I'm down"
cool. I should be able to get on around 9 EST. but it seemed like everyone else was available for it too.
Yeah I'm free today as well
"I guess we should say Im up, no more guardian down ;)"
*it echoes*
"*In the back of my mind, paranoia festers, reminding me of those damn words*"
"""Guardian down"""
Tonight I'll have coffee earlier so it kicks in before I die 20 times in the second encounter lmao
"Bungie, let us skip the third encounter pls"
Yesterday was messy af
Third encounter mostly?
Nah for some reason second was rough and we werent trying anything lmao
Or im confused idk
Ah. I'm gonna have to watch the turmoil
also the game didn't like Ron either lol.
RIP. What did the game curse Ron with?
just connection stuff and lots of error codes.
so...it was a good thing we didn't legit go for flawless last night aha.
hopefully it's better tonight.
*knocks on wood*
I kept getting anteater-ed and weasel-ed
I kept playing iron banner and stuff the rest of the night with no issues
If only Destiny’s servers were as solid as iron
Yeah I’m good for tonight
"Not with that Cats picture, you aren’t"
idk when but I'm gonna be getting 2700X haha. whenever the next time I can get to Cleveland is😂
"Anyone feeling for some Crucible / Weekly Clan bounties? (gambit, raid, crucible, nightfall: the ordeal)"
my dog will bring us good fortune for tonight. we cannot fail him.
My dog will probably just bark at the worst possible time like always
"his face... ""I'm gonna do it"""
goal your dog appears to have melted into the bedsheet
I know I never know where the blanket ends and the dog begins.

l o n g d o g g o
Are we doing it the same time as yesterday?
like 9ish I think if that's good for people.
Works for me
join us.
hey sorry but i need 10 more minutes
@Arixama @Trissin either of you maybe available to help with a flawless if Ron keeps having connection issues.
"I might be able to a bit later, not sure atm"
okay. we are giving it one more shot then. just let us know.
good luck!! Hope you get it!
@Trissin stay on standby please 😂
Alright @Trissin you can come in
I'm not sure it's a good idea for me to try for flawless tonight tbh
Because I am a bit tired and it is a little late to start attempts now
We can one shot
Pros
yeah?
Cons - we might die
"We keep getting to the final boss, Ron is just disconnecting at poor times"
Oh no :(((
One phased the third encounter
give me one min
@RonInDune ^ we are giving it another go next Thursday if you want to suffer again.
"I don't know how much I'll be playing over the next month or so, so @Trissin is welcome to take my place"
alright.
"are we running tuesday or thursday? because I cant do tuesday this time, we would start literally 11:30pm in new years eve"
I believe we decided Thursday
family would kill me before the adds
thursday it's fine to me
yeah it's thursday. warmind just hasn't updated for the new year so I can't put in January dates yet.
shoot fireworks at the boss :4Head:
"I was checking the footage of our last run and we deposited 39 motes and still wasnt enough, so I guess it starts with 10 as crizum said and we lost all of them"
it was 14+15+10
I don't see how tho...because only one goblin sacrificed right?
"no, it was like 3 of them"
that's shitty. whatever. hopefully some time away from it helps us.
"yep, we're super close to get it"
we'll get it. raid isn't going anywhere.
Anyone down to help farm the Castellum twice to help me get the last two seals for Acrius?
I won't be on until the evening.
"That's cool! If you're down with doing it, I can wait till this evening"
yeah I can help👍
I think I found my next dog😩😍😭😭😭
ngl thought that was a hammer and sickle background at first glance
anyone for some crucible games?
@Peronix won't be on tonight sorry. not feeling too great gonna hit the sack pretty early aha.
It's all good! I'm about in the same boat
hah yeah. i gotta catch up on sleep a lot.
So I guess if we use the new mods we can consistently one phase the third encounter. We should use taking charge which gives buff when pick up orbs (well and bubble give free orbs) and high-energy fire for 20% dmg buff. Buff lasts until an enemy is killed so it will be applied the entire damage phase
I want to one-phase the raid
I want to shoot the raid with Izanagis
we'll get it on thursday.
using those seasonal mods should help a lot then.
"Yeah I can get those set up, would also help for those who don't have gear that can have relay defender"
yeah. idk how much that would affect me since I'm on Divinity?
With how little the boss usually has if we need a second phase it should make it an easy one phase
"yeah that's what I thought, we'll probably get one phase more consistently"
nice. I'll make sure I have that mod set up for Thursday then.
I forget which obelisk it is
I'm not sure...but I know I took it haha.
"I belive it's from the first two obelisks, one from each"
i guess it only helps in this specific encounter tbh and maybe final boss if someone can't stack 4-5 enhanced relay
"each enhanced relay apparently gives 10% buff, so 3 enhanced + new ones you can get the same total buff"
"useful if you run one exotic like nighthawk, luna..."
yeah. maybe I could run nighthawk.
*do it for the ornament*
i can run nighthawk too but invisibility it's such a great get out of the jail card
yeah the tether helps me a lot in the third encounter as well. but i'll give nighthawk a go this time around. if it means me one phase then i'd rather that haha.

I ran through the entire Iron Banner squestline and bounties yesterday and they seemed to have tuned the requirements pretty well this season
The only step that took me some time was the 20 shotgun kills
Also if you play at 2 AM CST you get matched with teams full of Asian players who kick your ass all game
hahaha sounds right.
i haven't been playing at all lately. i don't think i can until we get the flawless done lmao.
I've learned to fear Crucible at midnight
I just want the lore but it just doesn't seem to drop for me
I've given up on the flawless lol
no Ron! we'll get it.
"my flawless LW took like, 4-5 weeks of scheduling runs before we ended up getting it."
It'll be a new year. a flawless year
longer raids are always the hardest to get flawless in anyway.
i think it's mainly because when there are more encounters to a raid it feels like such a drag and it's so draining.
but taking a break from it was good tbh.
@RonInDune definitely don't give up. The only reason you don't have it already is because destiny dealt you an awful hand of disconnects. You got this.
^^ that's true. i strongly believe we would have gotten it by now if it weren't for the disconnects. but it happens...we'll get it soon enough. the raid isn't going anywhere aha.
@RonInDune they are selling Amnestia-s2 for bright dust this week.
ooof I just bought it yesterday for silver
o o f.
I will make a new post for the Thursday night flawless gos if people want. or do we just know who we got for it I assume?
Thursday 9pm est
what is this est
yup. @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
alright guys I'm at a New Year's party and I'm going to try and entertain the kids by explaining Destiny lore in detail

"The raids offer some of the best gear imo, the armour has higher stat rolls, the weapons are generally quite strong, and the exotics are super unique and also some of the strongest in the game **(personal opinion)**"
_(we don't talk about tarrabah)_
Some of them can also drop specific mods that are really good or give cool emotes
I would be good with scourge this weekend.
I honestly don't think I could bring myself to do CoS or LW ever again😂
But *flawless Crown*
Imagine flawless King's Fall
"i see, would love to join for a raid. i only have done leviathan with people here but am very keen in trying more"
anyone wanna do sundials rn?
"I mean if you don't want to buy the expansions for the raids, Eater is a super short and easy one to do."
i just bought the expansions :blobDJ:
https://tenor.com/view/mha-anime-gif-10138734
Sat or Sun?
I'd like to get my spire counts up
Maybe a Spire and a Last Wish? Don't know how much @sasch you'll have to do to unlock LW though.
i think its on the map
so i'd say nothing to do to unlock it
Yeah I don't think there is any requirements story wise to play old raids
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1956375663
i need someone to explain to me how in the fuck you lose 44 motes in a single gambit game
im shocked
bamboozled even
*yikes*
Seen much worse...
*yikes intensifies*
i cant even imagine worse
that cant be possible
thats two games worth of motes
Probably klaybar
Other question is how did your invader get 19 guardian kills and only deny 25
he had like 12 kills in damage phase
The 158 lost had to be on purpose I refuse to believe that haha
like he wiped them three times in dps phase
only 19 kills because that was me and i could only invade after their primeval spawned
we could never get enough motes to open the portal because of these two bozos
Also what were you fighting?
Fighting my own team i guess
dang that pain I felt it
Gambit has some shitty damage scaling sometimes haha
Just walk around a corner and get blasted by a random cyclops
Gambit is a wierd mistress.  You can either get a really good team or a really bad team.  There is no inbetween
I'll take this over quickplay 6v6 cruicible any day
"For sure, but I’ve always felt gambit does some weird thing where if you are winning too much or by too much they crank up damage"
quickplay crucible is the most toxic experience i've ever had in this game
They toned it down a hwile back
I've noticed that for sure
the cathc up mechanic for gambit used to be really bad
Like dominate one match and the mobs just obliterate
I’ve had games where I roll enemies only for round 2 to have hyper aggressive shriekers pump more damage than nightfall bosses
#qualitygamedesign
Lol it's like the leviathian bow strike all good till that last boss
I still need that bow
"oh my god, I have never seen anything even close to that # of motes lost before"
"Has anyone here seen Uncut Gems? If so, can someone explain to me what happened because I feel so lost with the story"
what confused you?
"||What was the point of the guy shooting Howard at the end? Howard won the bet, right? Which means he'd be able to pay them off. Then why did he decide to kill the boss and rob the jewelry store?||"
||I think he was just a pissed off gangster who wanted some revenge for being stuck in that room for that whole time||
"||That makes sense. Seems like a strange way to leave things off--incomplete, almost. Good movie, the conclusion just robbed me the wrong way||"
||yea its not the most satisfying ending for sure||
It's a very typical Safdie brother ending
"Good Time and Heaven knows what also kinda weird endings, though Good Time did it pretty well"
good time is so good
RObert Pattinson is a legit actor
yea no joke
after good time i have so much more respect for him
@Infernosi what time in EST you had in mind for the raid?
/day
@Crizum @Peronix @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @Trissin @LW Mugetsu so we still good for around 9 EST tonight? I can start at like 8:45 as well if we want to go a bit earlier.
I can start earlier too but whatever is better to everyone
I can start earlier as well
I'm baking cinnamon rolls today so bringing that good energy.
Feed them to your PC in an attempt to please Bungie
the cinnamon roll scented air will be flowing through it.
*cinnamon-cooled* PC
@RonInDune I still think you should take your spot back
Oh I can't play today
I'm moving tomorrow morning and have so much packing left
"Ohh, wow yeah you must be pretty busy then"
Mostly just procrastinating but yeah lol
"Y'all got this, I believe!"
@thegoaliebear just let me know when to be on and I'll be there.
I also just bought AC Odyssey 😂
It's such a good game!
the gold edition was only $34 and the sale ends soon so I was like...yeah I'll do it lmao.
for the gays obviously.
I heard its actually a good game
"If you get Helix Credits with it, definitely buy the 50% XP boost"
It's essential
I played almost the whole game on Stadia
But isn't it a single player game?
Do you  need a xp boost for single player?
Yeah just the level up feels too slow otherwise
wow sounds like pepega gamedesign to me
I'm not sure what I got with it haha guess I'll see once I get to downloading it.
"Also I'd recommend playing as Kass over Alexios, but both are good"
Ron why do you think I bought the game.
*good* point
big buff spartan gf
she's very .... uh ... free spirited
hahaha yes.
it's been a while since I've gotten into a single player game tho. so I am looking forward to it.
It is an excellent game to zone out with
Incredibly gorgeous vistas
Plus I like how so many side areas were not labeled and you could just visit them randomly and find cool story stuff
@sasch Maybe sometime tomorrow? I'll be free the entire day.
"sounds good, i am working tomorrow so i will be home at around 2-4 EST?"
i think
So I started watching Netflix Witcher and honestly so far it feels like an R-Rated Xena Warrior Princess
https://tenor.com/view/larry-david-seinfeld-pretty-good-enthusiasm-curb-gif-3938316
yes. it's good I really like Henry Cavill too.
"@thegoaliebear I’m good whenever, otherwise I’ll just be playing Witcher 3."
"Didn’t play Odyssey, after Origins and all that XP boost nonsense it felt like a more predatory Witcher haha"
"sounds good. seems like everyone is okay with around 8:45 EST, so I'll @ yall later."
"Guys, Ninja has a new book"
When we dropping
"Money, that is"
is it out already?
or do I need to preorder it so I can make sure I get it?
waiting for the pdf copy
gamer time
"It's out, and it's called *Ninja: The Most Dangerous Game*"
It's a comic book
currently baking the cinnamon rolls so I'll be closer to 9 anyway now.
"np, take your time"
one sec.
@Trissin @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 we are good whenever.
Gonna grab a quick smoke
sorry I'll be on shortly :((
first try of the night!!
holy cow guys congrats!!!!
Fantastic work!
"If you ever need flawless garden ron, i'll run it with you"
I'm glad you guys got it lol
"I'll try again someday for sure, thanks!!"
we gotchu.
"dank, congrats guys"
"What exotic will y’all take with you into WWIII? Personally, I’ll take my Outbreak"
i think i would do the same.
Polaris Lance might not be to bad. If you hit nothing but headshots you never reload. Or the Jötun might be fun.
Telesto
"Black Talon, since I'd probably be able to use it best."
"Lumina, so that I can help those close to me"
anyone know the recipe for the cookies for saint-14?
"(Vex Milk, Personal Touch, Essence of Dawning)"
wonderful.
also for whatever reason the Warmind bot still lists me as 335 PL on raid completions. flawless garden at 335 damnnnn😂
what a god gamer
"Speaking of god gamers, where we dropping in WWIII?"
heard it was region locked to just NA players
so i won't be dropping anytime soon i think
"I'm sure the NA will find their way around this restriction. After all, cross-play is a favorite of the developers"

I know there are people who still need some triumphs for Garden done. I'd be down to do some runs this weekend if people want. i don't remember which challenges yall need tho haha.
would also be down to help someone who hasn't done it through it as well.
I just need zero to one hundred and I'll have the title.
cool. I'm down to do it this weekend if people want @Destiny [PC] ^^
"I need it to, so I'm down. Would it also be possible to do multiple triumphs, or we just sticking to Zero to one per run?"
I'm fine with doing multiple in one run.
I also need zero to one hundred to get the seal so Im down
whats a BTS stan?
is this some new age talk?
It's K-pop
"okay, what time would work for yall this weekend? I'm fine whenever after like 7 EST."
I'm free whenever
I'll happily join in
If we do it I'll get my first seal
"@Matos
https://media.tenor.com/images/d55616d06510c32544b66516fad41e71/tenor.gif"
"You can’t do zero to one hundred this week, it’s one of the time gated ones"
The next chance to grab it is 3 resets from now since it’s on the fourth encounter
Unless you can do the challenge on off weeks but I don’t think that’s the case
oh right I forgot zero to 100 was the actual boss challenge haha.
if there's anyone that isn't time related that people need then I'm fine with whatever. even if it's just a normal run.
@Trissin https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/839/199/8a9.jpg
me when I read this channel
I think we can do the challenge whenever we want but when it's the weekly challenge we get extra loot
@Destiny [PC] ^^ made one for garden tomorrow night. if we can do the boss challenge then great. if not i'm good with just doing a chill run of it.
thats in 26 hours?
Need to get up early sunday morning otherwise I would have joined
i would have joined if i was not away this weekend
no worries there will be more haha.
Anyone else farming season of dawn armour with 2 mobility and arc affinity?

"Strange though, cause charlemange works"
https://gyazo.com/a792c4618615dec3a9b4be8a5b847369

oh crap I have to give like 50 gifts to complete the mission still
anyone wanna run nightfall with me in a few I gotta pick up a friend
January 14th i believe
"perfect, thanks"
"@thegoaliebear I might be a couple minutes late tonight, depending on traffic when I'm leaving work. If it's not bad I'll probably be getting on right at 7:30 on the dot. Just a heads up"
s a d
"speaking of which, i had myself as an alt but i realized I have a dinner tonight with family at 630pm"
@Jeremy are you able to join? I don't mind starting later if needed if it means we have 6.
"@thegoaliebear just texted him, he isnt sure how long he will be at dinner. We are central time, so may be closer to 9-9:30 est"
"If you need a person I can come, but if you’d all be okay waiting go ahead haha"
"Depending on how long they are at saltgrass, which could be a while lol"
"Kimarais, where are you shipping Dodogama"
"Straight into my heart, because he is the best"
"I mean I'm okay with starting around then. depends on the others tho. if people don't wanna wait until then, then we can get Crizum in with us."
Sounds good to me 👍
Strange i never got the notification
if you guys wanna pull crizum feel free
if not it's fine
dodogamaaaaaaaaa
yeah I don't mind waiting until like 9-9:30ish to start it. won't take that long anyway aha.
Damn I guess I screwed up
"In 2019 our dear president decided to extinguish DST. So in my phone discord shows proper time, on pc it shows everything with +1 hour"
I can raid if you gyys still want to just tag me so I wont miss it
yeah it looks like we're starting in 1-1.5 hours from now most likely. so I will ping you.
"Cool, I'll be around. Sorry about that"
Anyone just want to mess around in a private match for a little bit?
It seems crizum was right
wish I had seen that private match request a little while ago
I'm just coming off a bit of a break so it'd be nice to get warmed back up
"We're still going if you'd like to join in. Finishing a match now, but join once we finish"
yeah doesn't look like the raid is happening tonight. i am going to sleep in like 20 mins aha.
Pffft ezclap
:Animeahhhhhhhh:
i have 8am practice tomorrow i don't want to be dead.
it's fine raid aint going anywhere
is it just Rumble or whatever Rover?
"Yeah, rumble"
/join 76561198075409104
You joining?
yeah just a second
that guy uh
was interesting lmao
"Yeah, that's one way to put it. Either way, thanks for the games."
"yeah, ggs man. Was good to see I can still do somewhat well"
do we want to try and raid tomorrow instead? or even do scourge if there are people who haven't done that one?
im free all day tomorrow pretty much so wuhueunever works for me
whenever**
cool. we'll see what people are up to tomorrow.
Early D2 concept art from Vicarious VIsions:
https://www.behance.net/gallery/73074633/Destiny-2-Warmind-Concept-Work
VV honestly has done some of the best parts of modern Destiny
@Destiny [PC] would people want to do a Garden run tonight? or a scourge? I'd be fine if it's a sherpa run as well.
Doesn't matter to me
I'm open to help with whatever
I'm down for anything
anyone maybe looking to farm out a Mindbenders today?
I’m down for a raid as well
@Destiny [PC] ^^ for tonight. anyone interested is welcome.
how did i never realize i  had an outlaw/kill clip sacred provenance lmao.
What's the best way to grind for the gambit shotgun? Lord of Wolves?
I used the raid shotgun for the range
"That works, or just do a triple shotgun loadout with acrius or whatever that void one is"
The close kills are one thing but the range helped me secure farther kills
Not sure why I am forgetting the name
Run shotgun scavenger
I'm worried my team will hate me if I go triple shotgun lol
And special finder
"Eh, as long as you aren’t the invader you’re fine"
I'm grinding for 21% rn
"Especially if you use the tractor cannon, providing a buff on the larger enemies and it can shut down invaders"
i am on rn if people wanna grind that out together.
Plus if either of the shotguns you run have 1-2 or trench barrel
oooh good idea that
You’ll be done with kills long before you’re done with rank
"Titan I ran bubble, but warlock run a well maybe? That way you are making up for your lack of range with support abilities and buffs"
lol maybe I should wait for a triple infamy weekend
Yeah well lock in gambit is pretty good and underrated
"If you want the seasonal title yeah, but if you just want the python no need to wait the goal isn’t high"
"@thegoaliebear I still need Python, so I’m down for some Gambit"
@Peronix sweet.
i should be on for another couple hours.
@CrizMobius join up whenever.
110799803
Have room for a 4th?
@Infernosi yes i am hopping off now but i think criz and jeremy are still playing.
"Ok, cool"
i will be closer to like 8:45ish for the raid.
"having audio problems, restarting pc brb"
Armor I'd definitely pick up and grind for on all characters
Bring back my King's Fall raid armor

*yum-diddly-dumptous indeed*
i watch it and i have ugly laughed every single time.
Agdq last wish speed run is scheduled for 8:02 central on thursday
I'll be on tonight at like 8 EST if people want to do gambit. need to get to heroic and then work on the emblem part of the season quest. @Destiny [PC]
"Im down for it, still need to get python"
sweet. it goes pretty quick.
I think I'm halfway through the quest if I'm not mistaken
nice. I just need the infamy rank for it now.
At this point all I need is the rank reset for 21%
The python quest works in gambit prime too
the kills go faster in regular gambit but I don't need those anymore. just the ranks. I don't mind whichever mode tho.
"@Yeti I know it does, usually I only play prime"
Anybody gonna be around tomorrow for reset? The Devil's Ruin quest is out and I'll be on if people want to team up (assuming it has some strike/crucible requirements)
8pm est's too late for me sadly
@Crizum ill definitely be on at reset for that
I'll be on tomorrow night after my game.
https://youtu.be/9wB2t5sgKgs
Hey Trissin
Solo Riven /s
@Crizum I'm down but probably I'm only be able to login 1 hour after reset. I'll let you know
for those who are on at reset lmk how much I'll be suffering again if it involves pvp.
@Crizum I'll be available to (Devil's) Ruin the reset
"lool I saw @Oathbreaker , kinda tempted to try"
honestly
I am too
but also i think it's kinda dumb how broken this is
yeah no kididng
"and then the other thing is classes just started back up right, so yknow"
school
starts tomorrow for me lol
classes
luckyy
my college has a day one orientation for any new students that semester because you can basically start at any point during year
In the reddit comments for that video @Oathbreaker @Trissin https://m.twitch.tv/clip/PreciousPowerfulWheelRaccAttack
LOL WTF
HEY TRISSIN
ARGOS ROUND 2
LET'S GO
this makes the game ~~easy~~ easier than it is already
Telesto doesn’t get to come back for Destiny 3
Roaring Flames x3 hammer will one shot in PvP right?
maybe? I'd need to test
"I think it was part of the buff, maybe three stacks could before"
don't have numbers off the top of my head
"Run heart of inmost light and telesto, grenade the telesto bolts to get empowered and three stacks of roaring flames and run around throwing a hammer"
With the solar plexus seasonal mod of course
i'm on now so for those who wanted to play gambit tonight join whenever yall want to.
Anyone interested in running pit of heresey for getting xenophage and lore?
*Cursed image*
C U R S E D
their our know rules
to english
*peronix is typing*
"*you open the door, the sound of purring filling the empty room. To the left is one king-sized bed. In it, Tony the Tiger lies, covers draped over his...well, you know.*

*You look him in his deep brown eyes, and with one breath, Tony mutters:*

“This is GRRREEATT”"
that hammer thing
is tougher than it looks
In pvp?
PVE
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/532187114
"Ah, gotcha"
if this thing is still around after reset i'm gonna give it another try
I think my grenade killed something and that ruined the run
gonna be playing for a bit later tonight after my game. still need to get to heroic rank for this dumb gambit quest.
Think tonight was the legend sundial run too
oh is it? what time did I make that for?
ah never mind. I'd rather do this than gambit lmao.
I might be closer to 9:15-9:30 tho.
I totally forgot I had a game tonight.
Sundial is quick assuming it’s not orbit on death
I’ll assume it’s orbit on wipe
probably. that's not so bad tho. shouldn't take too long.
@Trissin @Oathbreaker https://youtube.com/watch?v=H2qdW7mOn3k&t=
"lol yeah, I saw the other clips !"
absolutely crazy
ty for sharing!
Lol the modifiers for legend sundial
what are they.
also how does the devil's ruin quest look?
"ooh yeah, the new exotic quest comes out today right?"
They tell you how when you log in
There is a frame that can drop from champions in the sundial
i just need to know how long i'll be forced into pvp if that's the case.
"Modifiers are Scorched Earth (enemies throw significantly more grenades) locked equipment, match game, unstoppable and barrier champions, extinguish and ozletc’s clepsydra (arc damage increased, knockback damage and distance increased)"
sounds like a blast.
With how much damage and distance knockback does already how they gonna increase it
Psion launches your damn monitor at your face in the real world?
hehe. *blast*
https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/destiny-2-devils-ruin-quest-21232723
doesn't look like any pvp steps. pretty simple.
is there matchmaking for legend?
Anyone down for sundial legend?
i think there are people doing it now  but we have an lfg for tonight too.
No matchmaking
And we have three doing normal right now to see if devils ruin can drop
In voice chat @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
Oh forgot about tonight's run
I'll join in a few @Crizum
Yeah you can get the devils ruin quest in normal sundial
"so you just pull a weapon frame and do sundial, then there's a quest. that's really it?"
i have ptsd from that.
Goal I hope your prepared to suffer so much
i've suffered enough already i can handle anything.
is the frame from completion? or random drop?
just a completion it seems.
You can pull it as a reward
I assumed it would be like a fusion rifle for the secondary
It’s more like an angry trace rifle
it looks pretty decent aha.
It looks like an angry Reddit post about being op in crucible with no proof but a feeling
I smell a meta change
Bungie knows your sins
Aw 😦 I have those lol
oh.. uh yay!? lol
"There isn’t a worlds first race, so while I understand you don’t want obviously broken things I wonder why they disabled it so quick when other things stick around"
Because Titan :peepoClap:
*Devil's Ruin has been disabled*
Note that they didn’t touch winters guile
man I love the dialog in the Devil's Ruin
||Osiris and Saint bickering like a old married couple||
Feels like listening to party banter from a Bioware RPG
anyone want to do devil's run with me? i have until like 3:45.
It's easily soloable anyway
"i figured that, just always prefer having an extra person around aha."
haven't started the mission yet
gotten the quest thing
brain.exe isn;'t working
"damn... I did 980nf, 980 nightmare, PoH and got nothing to increase my light only dupes"
never done a 980 anything
"this week 980NF it's annoying, a bunch of champs in the same area"
@Jeremy we tried that 980 nightmare hunt that ended I'm tragedy lol
In**
LMFAO
lol legend sundial it's pretty much like the normal one in the sense that you can run out of time in every single encounter and still progress... smh
it's only 950 too. I don't think they intended it to be super challenging.
at least it's a solid way of pinnacle for the heavy slot
for sure. looking forward to running it tonight.
i did a lfg run
like they added match game and some enemies have shields but at the same time if you dont need to actually complete any enounter besides boss fight it's kinda lame
ok Legend Sundial is fairly simple
The only issue I had was boss stomps one shotting me lol
I did all hunter pinnacles and I'm still missing  arms and chest pieces *sadface*
everything else it's 970
"Bad news: I won’t be able to make it on tonight.

A silly question: of I only need komodo to get the savior title can I get the weapon at the next season and still get the title?
"No, you need Komodo in this season"
"K thanks, I asked because undying still listed there"
They had a tweet shortly before season of dawn that said you wouldn’t be able to get it anymore
Oh gotcha
Komodo is fairly easy to get honestly
Python is way more annoying
Python Im halfway there but I didnt start komodo yet
"Apparently Iran posted a picture of the Iranian after a mussel attack on a US base, mimicking Trumps posting of the American flag.

sadly there is no triumph for this week legend sundial
@thegoaliebear you said closer to 9/9:30?
yup...9:15ish for sure.
hopping on in a few mins.
mouse has an update one sec.
@Destiny [PC] 2 more spots for legend Sundial just join VC if you want to run it.
What yall up to tonight
we're just chillin all kinda doing different things.
welcome to join in the vc if you'd like.
sorry one moment I'm trying to find my wife's usb for her headset
hah. no worries.

I'm so dead inside
i also made an alt build so i could roll with a look like this.
Looks like someone from Prisoners of Azkaban
hell yeah. those ornaments take shaders so well it was so hard to decide haha.
@Destiny [PC] ^^ two spots for legend sundial run tonight.
too late for me :pepehands:
"Idk if I'll be able to, I want get the komodo quest done but I get so salty that I usually quit and cry myself to sleep"
":((( well, if you want a break from it, we'll be here aha."
I'll try do the crucible earlier then I might be ok at night
I've never done it before
On legend mode*
"🎶To be fair🎶

I don’t think anyone has for the most part. (It’ll be my first run on legend)

Also, I hope you get the reference for the “to be fair”. 🤞🏽"
it looks easy. it's only 950.
"It's very easy, I LFG-d it a couple of times and we completed easily without mics"
@AhRealMonsters is that a letterkenny reference
what makes it very easy is that you dont have to complete any of the encounters. by what I read on reddit you can fail if by the end of third encounter the bar is not full
"yep, just like menagerie."
@Yeti sure is!! 😁
I stopped being lazy and completed buzzard and python
heck yeah congrats!
"Now it's time to get some arbalest kills, I'm like 30/125 for komodo"
that will low-key go by pretty quick.
it is nowhere near as bad as Randy's 😂
Nah Im bad at pvp and I hate arbalest lol
wait for Mayhem and spam heavy linear fusions
I got 5 ~ 10 kills a game easy
"Don't tell me about randy's, im like 45% of kills and 95% of medals"
komodo did go pretty quick tbh. i found it went faster when i didn't care as much haha.
Also Komodo is honestly fairly handy in the sundial
it's pretty good lol...i have enjoyed using it.
Yesterday I got most of my kills after I decided when i ran out of ammo I yolo my way to death
"I really don't like the archetype to be honest, I can't see myself using it"
"But itst fine, plenty of time to get it"
"Some progress were made, 74/125"
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 almost there!
"thanks, almost there in the glory too. My sodium level it isnt that high, so I'll probably be around for some sundial"
"please let me know if someone cant make it, im chilling a bit"
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 want to join for a scourge run?
@RonInDune our buddy @AhRealMonsters got Anarchy first try

You've got to be kidding. 😬

raid kc?
@LW Mugetsu
you seemed upsetti spaghetti
have you gotten it yet
o:
Not realky
!sotp
Just frustrated that I haven't got it yet
!sotp LW Mugetsu
???????
9 raids though
Yeah. I've seen quite a few first timers get in raids I'm helping carry them through
its that noobie rng
@LW Mugetsu just be glad you're not at my number of clears without it haha. although i don't care about getting it 😂
Destiny has pity for me
I only got the game from black friday lol
I got mine at 42 kc
not like its good but
I had great rng in the forges but all my luck is wrapped up in that apparently
My RNG has always been dog shit
the last item i needed for Rivensbane (back in forsaken) was the ship
which is just as rare if not worse than 1k Voices
🤮
I'm going to live stream the dismantle of Anarchy
brb
@Kimarais/Nick
another anarchy first try
he is blessed by the gods
I got jötunn my first time in bergusia and double le monarchs in the next one
that many raids for rivensbane
I also haven't gotten a threat level of any kind.
I... got one of those too 😦
From sotp
that i can attest i got the curated first one
https://gyazo.com/c8959ff717efcd582293a931f508db98
22 completions is about average but still annoying
"The only exotic weapons I am missing are from last wish, scourge of the past. And crow of sorrows"
imagine getting curated threat level and anarchy first run
he's done for the rest of that raid
ezpz
I do have the sparrow and curated threat levels
That's not bad
What's up peeps!
I need the sparrow
My rng in raids is kinds shit
!lev
I need to do Levi
Levi is fun
Oh I don't doubt that lol I usually get through dogs and the chains then everyone quits
I say we get a group and get you guys through leviathan
This weekend I'm down
I'll make an lfg post for Saturday any specific times work for you guys

@thegoaliebear I fell asleep lol
hah no worries.
man the r/DestinyTheGame subreddit is sooo bad
Everyone there is so grumpy it's like a pack of teenagers
That's reddit™ tho
I much prefer the memes and screenshots of r/Destiny2
"Idk, if Bungie didn’t combine every good idea or intention with an absolute shit one less people would be angry all the time"
The boom and bust cycle of Destiny opinions should be studied by economists at this point
Addiction specialists more like
"Like those steam review for games that go ""I hate this game, absolute garbage, nobody play"" but have 3000 hours in it"
"To be fair, there's far worse things to be addicted to"
Like fortnite
Or Cocaine
but not by much
What's the worst game to be addicted to? Warhammer 40K? Magic?
"without a doubt, 40k"
worst for your wallet and socially.
oooof
dont get me wrong 40k is the greatest universe ever created though.
https://prnt.sc/qlfyex
need 1 more win at comp and im done
heck yeah nicely done
I really would like to get into some 40K lore but the wikis are just too complicated to start
40k lore from what I can gather: Everyone is shit.
I did see Event Horizon in a theatre so I know what I'm getting into
"People have literally spent thousands on a single 40k mini, so definitely not for the weak walleted"
Magic the gathering can get pretty expensive if you aren't careful. A friend of mine spent 3k on 1 card.
$3K ??‽?!!??‽
damn that card must bring breakfast on the bed every single
Ron look up the Black Lotus card
*day
Yep. Competitive players will spend way more.
He told me some go for a much as 15k.
@Crizum This? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRxCeO2KIS8
"Yeah, depending on if it’s an alpha or beta and condition it can go for 27k+"
"One was sold at auction for $166,100.00"
*bloody hell*
i am playing gambit rn if anyone wants to join. will be on for a few hours @Destiny [PC]
I’ll be on in like 20-25 minutes for that sweet Gambit emblem
bless. i just got to the emblem step of the season quest so i want to crank that out today haha.
i'll be back just grabbing some food if i'm not here whenever you happen to join.
are you guys going for team player emblem?
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 i am finishing a quest but yeah we are just finishing the seasonal quest.
"cool, that emblem it's pretty easy just need to gambit"
I decided play more momentum to get randy's
currently 335/450 so it shouldnt take long
"nice, you got it!"

That's actually kinda crazy

Middle tree titan might just be the go-to

I feel like whisper would top it

I forgot about whisper
Honestly I've barely played destiny lately
I think I'm like season rank 17 or something
The Eva bounties let's you level up super fast
If you're on this weekend
^ Yeah they do
I finished my season pass already lol
Maybe I'll do that this weekend
she's going away next reset right?
Yeah 😦
Be sure to have a guiding light ghost equipped as well
Once you finish the dailies and weekly Eva Bounties... Pick up the random ones which is just bake and deliver cookies...

Do you guys want to do something tonight? raid? some 980nf farm?
I’m down for whatever
won't be on tonight but tomorrow I'm just still finishing the gambit seasonal quest. almost done.
tomorrow works for me
I'm down for a raid
"Maybe we can do one of the old raids? Im missing stuff from scourge, crown and I never did last wish (this one I killed riven for 1k but never actually played it)"
Should I drop this with no context in the ps4 channel?
"@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 I’d    maybe be around for a raid or two, have been wanting to go for a crown or spire"
"I might be around tonight, if you need"
Oh yeah I never did spire too
"Spire is fun, I like it"
and that's not sarcasm
"Im down for any of those, whatever you guys want it's great for me"
"Personally I'd prefer crown or wish, scourge is good too but it's not a big deal to me"
"Id be down for a crown or spire run (that sweet, sweet emote)

I’ll be on all tonight as well"
I'd be done to join. That would add to my list of raids never ran
Btw @Kimarais/Nick are we still doing the raid marathon tomorrow?
and see if I can keep the noob exotic alive for first run :peepoClap:
What's the noob exotic?
"I should be on around 8 central myself if yall need an extra body, never done spire or crown so I want to get them knocked out"
He got anarchy on his first scourge of the last run
Omg

"Gonna hop on for a bit. We could do crown or something, i think we were talking about earlier"
@Kimarais/Nick and I are on. Down for spire or crown
"or whatever really, depending on how many we have"
"I could bring a friend and do any of the raids, maybe even Garden"
I can hop on as well
@Jeremy is apparently avail as well
"Okay cool, seems like we have 6 then"
Crown?
yesssss
sup fam we just beat the best team in our league 8-3 play them again tomorrow afternoon idk something about playing them that I love so much we just put a beat down tonight😂😂

i hate it
@thegoaliebear I understand your want of never touching Crown now
it's awful.
"The word ""donation"" terrifies me tbh"
I liked Crown the first few times and then after I was like why do I keep doing this.
But now you share a title with the world's favorite hedgehog
haha that is true.

Yay welcome back @Thawxtem
We've missed you!
I will be playing gambit tonight around 9 EST if anyone wants to join. just gonna be finishing the seasonal quest for the emblem.
Also open to nightfall/any other leveling up activity
"btw folks, they're fixing the Wishender damage bug next reset, so if you're planning on doing an easy solo Shattered Throne now the time"
@Kimarais/Nick farewell to your fave weapon lol
aight I'll be on closer to 9:45. still gonna to gambit if anyone else wants to join I remember Thawx said he might want to.

F @Trissin

i'm like 10 motes drained from a bank away from my invader triumph and emblem
which i recently found out what it tracks
Would anyone want to do a Last Wish run sometime tonight or this week? Want to get a good Chattering Bone roll
"I'm down for last wish sometime, sure"
Depends on my schedule though
"Cool! Just let me know what day works best for you when you can, and I'll make a post"
i can do a run this week.
"I'm relatively free tomorrow after 7 EST, is that good?"
"And I mean definitely see what time works for others, I don't have to be a part of it lol"
i can be on any time tomorrow evening.

4:30 AM... managed to save Saint-14 in two days. Remind me not to leave for so long.
just remembered I made some plans to play with some of the guys from Loyal tonight so won't be around for LW sorry!

"call the pararazzi, i want a picture of this"

This video is really accurate
"Of course I'm not even near Datto's level of achievements in the game, but I feel like he does a great job describing the current state of the the game and lack of things to do"
"I usually disliked his videos in D1 but in D2 I felt like his videos are a lot better. it's nice that he can point out things about the game without being like, unnecessarily negative about it ya know."
The Crown of Sorrow raid jacket has FINALLY arrived today!
NIce!!!!
I think you and asterisk-kikker were the first in our clan to complete
I thought Trissin or someone was first
hmm second then
You thinking of the raid weapon you and I got almost together?
"ooof I still haven't gotten Anarchy though, I can only get it after you"
And I think I ran Scourge like 10 more times
Wanna scrape together a team later this week?
"I do, but my internet has been utter crap lately and I don't think it's a good idea for me"
Sorry to hear that
"Sorry guys, client decided to throw a bunch of work at me so I won't be able to raid tonight like planned. Is there another day that works for everyone?"
"I think I'm gonna be pretty busy over the week, maybe like Friday night or something"
Feel free to raid without me tho
"Don't worry about the run tonight, not sure we had enough people anyways"
"I can go pretty much any day after 8pm central, barring unforeseen delays at work."
"Just curious, what power level should I be shooting for to start being effective in raids?"
940-ish for Garden of Salvation
dope
750 for everything else
"in that case, I'm down to clown a bunch of these days too 🙂 PST time zone though"
thx for the info @RonInDune
Finally finished the Constellation lore book
"Very cool insight into what the Speaker truly was, highly recommended"
"Oh man I don’t have very many of those, need to get sundials in I suppose"
"Just missing the final Unveiling lore now, but that's been bugged for months"
"Once you start getting the lore, you get one every couple of runs"
453/455
that's crazy!!
lol yeah that's my main reason for playing the damn game
bungo got me hook line and sinker
i'll give myself 100/455 at the very max lol
tbh it's more likely around 50
I’m at 425
"Nah you'd probably be around 200 ~ 250, that's the average according to one of the website"
Missing a bunch in Confessions and Evas Journey
"Eva's journey is from doing Heroic story missions, right?"
yall have keen eyesight
idk how you find all the lore and stuff
(mostly youtube lol)
"lol, but even still it's some work to follow those guides and collect every piece"
"ALso, me and @Thawxtem would go lore hunting after Forsaken everytime a season dropped"
"True, but it's quite fun"
Especially the sound of the lore pick up is *so satisfying*
^^^New post for the Last Wish raid. We can start later if needed
wish i could help but I will be away thursday-saturday.
There's some new quest-ish stuff out
What is?
||Osiris lets you into the COrridors of Time|| indefinitely
so to my understanding in Escape from Tarkov you get to keep anything you find on Scav runs long as you extract or survive and can still do quests that way?
that's sweet. I gotta do those😂
ok it's a massive new puzzle
all the symbols are up and we need to figure a path through the maze
what is this even for.
who even knows at this point
"I found a ""reset"" button but I can't find it anymore lol"
all I know is that next tuesday is the bastion quest lol.
ok these mission impossible lasers are real freaking annoying
wish I was on a hunter
"no, i think bastion its on 28th"
Has anyone tried following the pattern of the symbols from both part 1 and part 2?
dunno I'm going random for now
oh wow that's even further away than I thought  haha @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
I think I'll follow the symbols from the planets then
"ok if you go in the wrong thing, you get a reset"
I highly doubt this is needed for the title or anything important but if it is lmk lol.
||It's probably for that datamined exotic rocket launcher||
it's just brute forcing
holy shit I found something
lol okay so then I don't need to do it.
Spill the deets!
or it could be like Niobe labs where all you get is an emblem😂
What pattern?
no diea lol
"it was the PLus, then snake, then the 4 leaf"
I forgot after that
I got lore and the columns lit up with symbols
and I died as soon as I got to the middle
Imagine you do all that and it’s ||fucking dragons breath||
meh lmao.
hmm it keeps killing me
it doesn't like you :(((
"it's definitely a puzzle of some kind, with all these symbols"
they've probably solved everything on reddit already but I wanna solve it myself dammit
"Actually Ron, ||they have not. They are around the same spot you are last I checked||"
~~beat the reddit nerds~~
I believe in you.
me and @Thawxtem are exploring the new quest if anyone wants to join us!
there's a new quest? i didnt even notice it
apparently. seems like it's only for lore.
we accidentally solved another one
now we don't remember the path
"What if you had to remember the path to get out, and if you didn’t, your character would be locked (trapped in time)"
now that would be cool haha.
we're breaking out the ol' pen and paper strats
A notebook dedicated to Destiny puzzles?
Perhaps the Motebook?
I should buy the big Destiny stationary box
I remember doing LW for the first time I had a P and A column in my notebook haha.
"So, ||does this look like any particular D1 weapon?||"
"||hmm.... Looks to be a modified version of the OG swords from the Taken king that eventually got turned into Raze-Lighter, Dark Drinker, and Bolt-Caster||"
"||If I remember correctly, those swords were curved blade and not straight blade though||"
these corridors are confusing lol
"They are, but once you know where the correct path is, you can just run straight through"
||CORRECTION: Straight blade in D1. Exotic swords were curved.||
im just sayin
||An odd choice for a grave marker though..... Only ourselves and Shaxx were involved in the making of those from what I remember||
||Return to the Dreadnaught confirmed||
Thanks Valve
"||And if it was meant to be Shaxx's grave, he's got far more iconic things, like the sigil of the Crucible, or his helmet, etc.||"
"||There are 19 pieces of lore, so this might go on for 19 hours|| btw"
||could be *OUR* grave||
** *oooooooooh* **
||This is weird. I don't know who's grave it is intended to be||
||Praedyth?||
"||We also have more iconic weapons or ways of marking our grave. Those swords.... They weren't used from day 1 of D1, they weren't really *OUR* weapon because Shaxx fucking yoinked our damn Raze Lighter the bastard||"
||Praedyth's grave is in the Vault. He was present in the sealed chamber in the Gorgon's Lair where the materials chest is present||
||Serously I can't think of anyone important who that could be.||
||Maybe the people mentioned in the GoS armour lore??||
"||The only other person who had a hand in the creation of a sword was Eris Morn, who took the initial shard of Willbreaker||"
||Thought the Kentarch-3 killed each other in the Garden?||
||Wasn’t that emblem thing in the OG tower or no?||
||Thought it was the Vanguard Emblem||
"Anyway, there is some leaked audio with massive spoilers ||that points to Saint holding a vigil for our character, believing us to be lost in time but able to somehow pull our way out, whereas everyone else believes us gone|| <-massive spoilers don’t get mad if you click"
||Absolutely was the Vanguard Emblem||
@Crizum  ||yes! I high key love that idea of our Guardians getting lost and hope it gets turned into something more.||
frick I should not have clicked that
"cant get mad ron, you did this to yourself :goal_finger_gun:"
:goal_finger_gun:
me_irl
"I love the idea that ||Saint being around is messing with the timeline too much, and now a choice must be made. Saint-XIV or us? Saint obviously makes the choice for us||"
"||Vex logic would be without us there is no saint, go back and put everything in to one last ditch effort to erase us, eventually we end the vex threat completely and wipe a player off the board for Destiny 3, we don’t even touch Savathun until D3, the rest of 2 is us uniting the fallen and defeating the vex, an uneasy alliance with the cabal and a massive war against the darkness and hive|| but would Bungo even try that?"
That's honestly way too ambitious for Bungo
||my SIVA obsessed guardian loves that idea lmao. I would really love to see a story line where we ally with another enemy race.|| but yeah that is too much for bungie to handle haha.
"||Ron, the Kentarch 3 are likely dead. Current running theory is Yardarm-4 and Rekkana were killed by Lisbon, after all three were ""turned"" by the Darkness, Lisbon changed his mind, started a fight with other two. Uses Divinity to kill the other two, leaving no bodies. He's the last one standing, *potentially* gets turned into a Vex along with his Ghost, becoming the Sanctified Mind and the Consecrated Mind respectively||"
ahh ok that changes things
Oh. Apparently ||The sword on the grave is also next to Saint in the hanger||
So tempted to spoil myself
Honestly it’s so weird
"This is both the worst and best time to play destiny, the story is coming faster than it ever has feels like"
Value just needs to be readded to everything else
"May be interesting to allow all raids to drop pinnacles, but maybe cap you at a certain amount of pinnacles per week?"
You could grind whatever you like but not no life yourself to the cap in a day
You can currently get like 7 pinnacles a week yes?
5 in Garden (counting weekly challenge) 1 in pit 1 in legend sundial?
yeah i think all raids should still drop pinnacle gear.
"Could be nice to still cap you at 7 pinnacles, but allow you to earn them in any raid, and maybe even the competitive playlist?"
talking about pinnacles I feel only 10 level increase each 3 months is not enough to keep us busy for 3 months. when shadowkeep was released there was more levels tro grind before the pinnacles. this season most started at 960 or pretty close to that
"I've reached the cap on my hunter, my warlock and titan need 1 piece each and we still have 2 months of season"
"||||If anyone needs to catch up on the quest, here is a link to the symbols that will get you to the good stuff||

||https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/eooky2/doing_the_patterns_on_the_obelisk_in_the/?sort=confidence||"
Don't know if that is a spoiler... but better safe then sorry 🤷‍♂️
||https://youtu.be/55ecIgP9svc||
"Codes for the quest, if anyone is lazy as I'm"
hah mood. might give it a go a some point.
also which challenge is it for the raid this week? anything we might want to do or mainly just going for a chill clear?
"@Peronix I have no idea what your daily schedule is like, but I have like 1-1.5 hours after practice I will play some EFT."
@thegoaliebear this week's challenge is to bank 10 motes each time at the third encounter
"I think next week it's the zero to one hundred challenge that me and Mugetsu need, maybe Peronix also needs it too"
I cant post my photo because it wont let me do spoiler for it cause mobile :(
||It seems there's an emblem for the puzzle?? And it looks pretty good too||
Idk if you guys are aware but one of the Bastion quest steps (coming on 28th) is to complete 10 spider wanted bounties. So I suggest get some ghost fragments or even complete the bounties now to only claim them when needed.
**tysm** @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
You're welcome @Trissin
"oh yeah ||the emblem gives different results for diferent people, I tried mapping all the possibilities last night||"
oh hey I made it into the ||inner circle with the sword||
"Ignore the red colour, it's just me taking a nap"
btw here's a website to put in the code you see during the ||emblem run||

"Just fixed my mic, so I'd be down for a few scan runs @thegoaliebear"
okay I have class now but I'll be home around 4 ish.
@Trissin ||remember the unique code you get once you get the emblem? It's not matching up with the grid||
no I don't remember unfortunately
"There's a bunch of unique ones, and we might need them to create an outer grid"
we still raiding tonight right boys.
i would like to think so lol
We're doing *all* the raids
just making sure haha.
@Peronix i did not consent to this.
3xcrown
for the culture
I consent
can't wait to have the consecrated mind back in our life @Peronix 👀
"👀👀👀

Raid you say, indeed we are"
"Consecrated Mind, that fluffy bitch"
good luck folks
we bow to its fluffiness.
"FYI, I leave work around 4 hours from now, then microwave dinner, then I’ll be ready for raid. Might be a few minutes behind scheduled start time"
Would y'all mind doing a couple of challenges this run? I still need Voltaic Tether and Repulsion Theory
im down to try them
"Sweet. If I can get the hunter cloak tonight, then that'll mean all I'll need for Enlightened is next week's challenge"
If you need a body I'll be available
"This city doesn't know how to deal with snow, so classes got cancelled 😎"
"Where are you at again Trissin? You're BC, right?"
Or am I thinking someone else?
Temps here dropped to mid 60s (18°C ish) and I almost froze so I don't envy y'all
"18C its almost my AC temperature right now, real feel its 32C (89.6F) outside"
Yeah I'm in vancouver @Oathbreaker
So compared to Ontario it's absolutely nothing
you guys get lucky during the winter
schools and colleges/universities stay open with ice storms going on
Yeah I'm aware lol
where I'm from at least lmao
Hamilton right?
this city is a madhouse lol
"wow, 32? do you mind me asking where you're located @Sarsante - 76561197967628966"
@Trissin That sounds like San Antonio with a centimeter of snow lol
"aha lol, is it a big deal there too?"
"Yeah man, LOL"
Same thing when it rains... peoples memories get washed away :peepoBONK:
"@Trissin Sao Paulo, Brazil"
"whoa, that's cool"
"I have some friends from there and they tell me it's  quite beautiful, I want to visit"
I was ~23 when I first saw snow IRL and it just as amazing as I though it would be honestly
I've seen snow 5 times in my life. Gulf coast of Texas doesn't usually get cold enough for it.
^ so true 😦
I've seen it I think 3
I'm on the gulf coast right now (near Galveston) and it's misty as heck
Feels like the start of a horror movie
"Oh snap, you're local"
"@Trissin it's pretty cool, where are you located?"
The only time I saw a significant amount of snow in 2004.
I'm in vancouver atm!
@RonInDune it was like that this morning on my way to work
"I saw a poor USPS truck that got into an accident due to the mist yesterday evening, so take care!"
I guess I'm done with Bastion prep https://prnt.sc/qo9dty
"Just to throw this out there, did you know you can use Windows Key+Shift+S to use the built in snip tool with windows? It gives you different options to take the screenshots."
"Well, that's assuming everyone is using windows lol"
"Does it have to be wanted bounties, not regular ones?"
"The data mining just says bounties, so not sure. I have 10 of each just in case haha"
"@Crizum true, I'll do 10 regular ones too"
@Trissin would you be able to sub in for our Garden run if monsters can't make it?
If  he can't I can.
alright cool.
i need 5 min brb
"oh crap i didnt see the ping, sorry about that"
"thanks for filling in mugetsu, mb haha"

This is about how far we've come
The powerhouse of the cell
They're estimating it's less than a quarter done
what kind of compound is that.
It's a prion
The chemical makeup of cocaine
the coke that you snort.
Nah that's a fucking polymer chain
"This is me drug-free, unfortumately"
fuck polymer chains

"Put some repec on Polymer's name, a million years from now after all humans are dead, polymers are all that'll remain"
gotta love plastic
"look, I just did not like my last chem class"
Organic chem broke me
I just found out that Bazehonker has some BIG honkers
stop
There's a reason I'm in mechanical engineering and not chem
this is why I stopped with all things chem after my first year of college lol
10 years ago
my whole schedule revolves around chem
half my day is spent mixing random shit together
okay let me clarify
chem sucks
not gonna lie
the other half of my day is spent doing physics.....
"I *enjoy* chem, and hell I still find it useful for materials science and knowing that this particular metal is shit because it'll oxidize like a motherfucker but the classes are *reeeeee*"
fact tho
physics is fun though
my physics teacher suggested i do both gen-ed phys and ap phys
"I did a lot of VLSI circuit design, but that didn't have much chem other than knowing a little bit of doping ratios"
"you guys may not realize it yet, but the kids your handing this world off to are going to make it hell"
eh the kids are alright
"The kids will do what they always do, say they'll revolt and make some small changes but largely keep the status quo"
i wish you guys could see what i see........
honestly the college kids I taught are way more respectful and mouth off way less than in my days lol
highschool life sucks
I think it depends on the college and the program
absolutely sucks
aw I'm sorry to hear that
I am surrounded by idiots
lol that did not go the way I expected it to
but yeah high school is rough.
"some dumbass got kicked out of chemistry for  making a ""semi-explosive compound"""
"teacher looked at him, stood up, walked over, asked what he was doing, then before he even answered, she called security"
remember the radioactive boy scout?
A kid who made a home made nuclear reactor
I've heard about him
He should be the idol of all kids everywhere
"I remember how popular the anarchist cookbook was, even though nobody actually made anything"
The guardians for Australia event is out:

ooh...I might get that shirt then.
Yeah I got it right quick
Love the emblem too
it is nice for sure.
"oh the pride pin is back on sale as well, if people missed out last time"
https://bungiestore.com/collections/whats-new/products/pride-collectible-pin
"*Finally* nabbed that Pride pin, thanks for the notification!"
btw has anyone played Horizon Zero Dawn?
https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1217884242857877505
"ohhh I havent but wanted to, it looks fun"
lmao i could not get into that game for the life of me.
no?? why not???
I never got past the missions for the testing or whatever tf it was lol.
idk it just didn't stick with me.
Oh I might have to replay it on pc
I wish they'd port Bloodborne or Demon Souls over
cause I didn't like DS3 or Sekiro all that much so I've missing that pure Souls action
Bloodborne. 60 FPS.  😩👌
"Ill be tempted to get horizon zero dawn, but I have so much stuff to play and no time :((("
Yeah now that Cyberpunk 2077 got delayed as well
As did Final Fantasy
yeah I have Odyssey now so if I want a single player game I'll get into that one haha.
*120 hours later*
Did people catch the announcement from Sakurai this morning
Yeah Kassandra is too good
Who's Sakurai?
https://media.tenor.com/images/c280770552e15906513afa6b36a1a19c/tenor.gif
I've never played that lol
it's fun!
It's console only tho right? I might buy it when the Switch Pro comes out
Bought the shirt and pin
"Yeah, I believe it's switch only rn"
@Trissin boy I sure am glad they released another blue haired anime sword user from fire emblem! Was really starting to think they would be underrepresented!
"as a weeb, _reee_"
"This one can also be a girl! And when you pick the girl you get to see her legs through her stockings, such good design"
"Wake me when they add a character that isn’t “dude, but with boobs and thighs”"
"Fine, fine, all there are too many anime characters  in smash now

But you agree with me that the moveset is pretty cool, no?"
"Yeah seems fine enough, I guess I just saw it as a missed opportunity for like MH or something. And I don’t actually mind anime, you can’t deny that if it WAS Dante that dude is anime AF,"
I’m just not a fan of the blank self-insert getting a slot haha
"yeah, I gotcha 

More variety is always appreciated"
Imagine if a game did a cross over with Destiny and instead of Shaxx showing up to yell at people it’s some random in a blue set of armor that says nothing lol
I’ll still probably get the next fighter pass though
Need to put more time in with my boy Joker
ooh you main joker? Damn
he is a lot of fun
I mainly hide in a corner and spam “Lookin’ cool Joker!” Until my friends get mad
You know I just realized the irony of “not a fan of blank self-insert btw I play Joker”
"but I guess compared to something like fire emblem, which has like idk, 6 characters in the game already?"
8 now
7 before Byleth
I mean Ill never complain about more fire emblem characters
"Plus like, all the previous pass characters were non-Nintendo"
So I think the expectation was to continue that trend
Which is fair absolutely
There’s nothing in Byleths move set that couldn’t be a MonHun character
MH would have definitely been super cool to see
Final Smash is just a turf war between savage deviljho and some version of Rathalos
"no, it's the b52"
that would be funny
"I guess another thing is that I'm currently playing through three houses, and that definitely raises my appeal for the dlc"
@RonInDune Horizon Zero Dawn is great
Yeah actually from the bits I know about both Horizon and Ron I think he’ll really enjoy it
Nice!! Thanks folks
"Go in as blind as you can story wise, that’s apparently a big selling point and you are Mr. Lore"
All I know is big robot dinosaurs and red haired lady
That sold me tbh
I wonder how much of it being ported is because Death Stranding uses the same engine so it wasn’t a start from scratch thing?
ooooh good point
THe Decima engine
"Can also vouch for horizon, the atmosphere is incredible"
"yeah Ron, you will most likely enjoy it haha."
btw I played some more of the Halo Reach mp and bloody hell it's full extreme sweat lords
And the DMR makes every other gun useless
What playlist?
not comp
or Arena I forget what it's called
I mostly did Slayer and the mode with Snipers only
Swat?
this is good
"that is good, yeah
breakneck is in dire need of a buff"
I don't know if that will be enough though
"honestly probably not, but I'll try it out for a bit anyway to see"
is that him
https://gyazo.com/7d7bb431fd8a41d8609d33565b55ecca
has he done it
Might as well just retire tbh
*plays FF7 Victory Fanfare*

"Idk if any of you didn't complete IB quest yet, but IB will be back next week and the rocket launcher step will auto complete."
"@Peronix ""love it when the game reflects the lore in that sjur cannot will not be stopped"""
PSA from a Hunter's perspective
btw progress is good on the puzzle
||Holy shit that upper left linkage||
yup it's all coming together
I still think it'll be 3D
btw what is the first one here?
||https://twitter.com/Protheon_/status/1217844001916715009||
also what weapon is that
in the first pic
that was an encoded message in D1 from one of the crucible maps on Venus
people were super excited about it for a while then it fell off because of some other secrets iirc combined with it only being a message
"as for the fusion rifle.... quite a few different ones held that model from what I remember. 77 Wizard, LIGHT/BEWARE are just a few examples of that specific base model"
ah i didn't realize it was a fusion
Guns were also not fixed element at that point so it literally could have been any of the models with an Arc roll
like D2 Y1
off the top of my head
that could have been Plan C
"not plan C, sights were different"
Plan C was still Arc
Definitely not it
Oh shit that was arc
Uhhhh
It honestly looks like a LIGHT/BEWARE or 77 Wizard model
Because both had that side venting
Damn too dark too see for me and even then I never really used fusions
I just don't remember if either had the exposed core near the back
"Fatebringer, fang of ir yut. Black hammer and galley were my go to"
Praetorian Foil was solar so definitely NOT Praetorian Foil
I forgot the weapons could drop in any 3 types too
Shit used to be nice
The LDR sniper was my fav
Nothing like a good ol final round sniper
Not to mention felwinter's lie
MWUAHAHha
"I had a Longbow Synthesis with Shortgaze, Grenadier, Snapshot, and Unflinching"
I would kill for that rifle again
Xur if anyone cares
The only exotic I don't have is Anarchy and I'm still pretty salty about that
It's strange that Luna's howl is meta again pvp wise
Surprised NF isn't
"Although with revoker, and a decent HC you could just body and body shot"
stability and handling makes Luna's better than NF
NF has range
"Man I still haven't gotten Lunas yet, the solar kills take too long"
woah that Spare Rations
what's the best roll?
"but wait, NF only gives like plus a meter or so"
OH GOD RON
DON'T START WITH THAT
NONONONONONONONONONO
FUCKING SPARE RATIONS
NEVER AGAIN
Spare has so many theoretical best rolls
no one true god roll
technically there are some defined as such
this is the roll I use:
that's good enough
These are the weapons I usually always have on me
Except that new rocket that's 960
Revoker 😩
So gooooood
I'm catching up to my sole survivor kills although I only have like 400~ crucible kills with it
I used Blast Furnce/Right Side of Wrong/Recluse so much that I gave up on them
"Still good to me, but randy's has been a go to for long range now"
This slaaaaps
I love the sound too
Definitely been enjoying it
"yeah I love the sound Revoker makes, so satisfying"
Also Mario Kart 8 outsold Destiny over the last decade??? How is that even possible
https://www.engadget.com/2020/01/16/npds-best-selling-games-of-the-decade-charts-call-of-duty-dom/
So much cod
"No wonder Destiny didn’t live up to activisions expectations, only the 18th top selling game of the decade what a fucking failure"
Which CoD was the one set in space and had Jon Snow as the villain?
Infinite Warfare?
Might get that one if it's cheap
I got confused between infinite warfare and advanced warfare and was really confused for a second there
"And Ron MK8 is on the wiiu and switch, and I think it was pretty close to launch"
It’s probably above breath of the wild thanks to the extra units the wiiu sold
Huh it's one of those games that's not on my radar so I think it's not that big
plus Mario Kart has more accessibility due to it being a good “party” game and having simple gameplay
Surprised Minecraft is only 10
Also wasn't battlefield 1 a flop?
Battlefield 1 and Battlefront were both viewed as flops by the larger community iirc
"Due to the backlash from the loot boxes,  but obviously gamers are fucking stupid and don’t actually care seeing how much cod is on that list"
I would actually be interested in the statistics for Mario kart 8 and destiny
"Like are they calling the switch version Mario kart 8, or did they smash deluxe and Wii u versions together"
Is it destiny as a franchise or just destiny 1? Are they including sales of dlcs for Destiny 1 in there or just base game copies?
yeah true. would be interesting to know.
"Like they obviously seperated all the call of duty games out, but was that just to pad the list or what?"
"I think sales of dlc counts towards that game, and I’d assume they count various versions"
"Destiny would be the odd case of counting as a franchise, but it may just be D1"
"And I don’t think it was to pd the list ari, cod just sells so much"
"That's why I'm curious about it. With out knowing the actual parameters, ""best selling game"" is so vague."
"Is gta v only the best selling game because it has 6 different levels of purchasable in game currency listed as dlcs, or are we talking about base gtav selling a bunch of copies across all the platforms its on?"
I just want to know what the qualifiers are 😭
"Assume that it counts sales of the base game, goty editions, and larger scale dlc but not in game purchases"
"So shark cards wouldn’t count, but the dlc heists would?"
"It’s either that or base units, i don’t think in-game micro transactions count otherwise it’d be top grossing and not top selling"
"If that's the case, then gtav being the top slot is insanely impressive, because all of their actual in game content is free"
So they're revenue comes from base game sales and shark cards
"No idea, it’s all sales which are a bunch of made up numbers you can mess with to say whatever you want"
Man I should get GTA V one of these days just to see what the hype is about
Didn't they put out a Casino DLC recently?
It’s like when you see “The number 1 comedy in America two weeks in a row!” Okay it was the only comedy and it made like 20 million total but go off
So I’m pretty sure cod Minecraft and Fortnite all get to say “top franchise of the X”
GTA can be a lot of fun but can also be really frustrating at times
I'm surprized none of the Blizzard games are up there
OVerwatch/WoW/Starcraft/HoTs
Or any of the EA sports stuff
"Actually yeah, I'm really surprised about that too"
I didn't really expect StarCraft to be on there unfortunately but Overwatch is huge
"Oh man is Starcraft dead thes days? I though it was the biggest Eport ever, till Fortnite/plunkbat/Dota etc."
"Yeah, it's not nearly as big anymore :(("
Like WCS and other tournaments still exist but I don't think there is even half as as much interest as when 2 first launched
THat's honestly pretty sad
Scarlett was an idol
and IdrA and Stephano and all those people
Does Scarlett even play these days?
She was Canadian too
"I think scarlett may still play here and there, although I havent watched high level starcraft consistently in a couple of years"
The scarlett vs bomber series from 2013 may still be my favorite starcraft esports moment all time. Those fucking banelings lol
Guess we won’t be hearing from Fenchurch:rooW:
thank god.
So the map shape is coming together now
Progress!
"Sorry guys, but I had family come up last minute. I never get to see these guys, so I won’t be doing the raid tonight, sorry."
"It's good, it happens."
@sasch Have you still been looking to run some of the year 2 raids?
could do but tekken 7's been having all of my attention recently
"if you are referring to that one; that is too late for me sadly, was just about to get into my bed"
"Ah, gotcha. Well, take care either way."
"Might be just a little bit late, sorry in advance"
"It's all good, no worries"
"My internet is derping, I dont think I can raid. Took forever to go to tower then got weasel, tried again and got another weasel"
"Oh no, rip"
So then I think we are going to need 2 more right?
I understand. No worries @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
"it sucks tho, I'm sorry"
Anyone down to run through Last Wish @here? Need two more people
"No need to apologize! I had Comcast for two years, so I understand Internet problems:rooFeels:"

"A maze, I think"
"Once the map is completed, people will start exploring"
||Map of the corridors of time. It's no wonder some of osiris' reflections committed suicide||
better be something good at the end of this😂
Two tokens and a blue
lmaooo imagine if there was just nothing.
I'd send a *very* strongly worded lettter to Bungo
in that case
"it would be cool if there was like, a special cut scene or something once it's solved."
The Data miners have spoiled a bunch but we're still not sure of everything
We don't know what's accurate and what's not
"It's data mining and that said dark drinker would be on opulence, so it's not super reliable"
true lol.
"I could be wrong but I feel people are overthinking the CoT. I highly doubt we'll have to go to 100 plus rooms. Also we get a piece at every lore , why only the last one is relevant? Idk, I've a lot of questions rn"
"i mean, we got confirmation from bungie that we're making good progress the other day"
And only the rooms with symbols will be actually run in the CoT. The blank ones just connect the map.
So people have started exploring and finding dead ends

Alright so people are starting to try to bruteforce the path now
"If you can find a path from top to bottom, go for it!!!"
For eg:
If we can get a group to try this that'd be great
another one:
New map:
||https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/667921536233111572/668279228789424128/Mega_Map_SM.png||
Fairly high res too
"We have the entry and the exit, just a matter of finding a path through now"
Do we know entry and exit for sure?
"Through they may be revered, the bottom might be entry"
thicker yellow line on top and bottom?
honestly I'm tempted to put some time in
"Some people are guessing the path will be 26 symbols due to the ""marathon"" hint"
but that's a bit spinfoil hatty
"Marathon ""hint"""
Another worry is there might be some hexes missing that'll open up other paths
I started doing it and I keep hitting dead ends dang
Wish I had a drawing tablet
whisper of the worm.....
hmmmmmm....
"@Saint 14's loyal follower that's a good weapon, do you have it?"
tryna do the quest tho
"make sure you bring a team! It's definitely possible to solo it, but I think it's much easier in a group"
Especially given the time limit
If it's your 1st time I'm pretty sure it isnt possible to solo without a lot of practice
The parkour bits take a while to get right
The jumping puzzle is a pain.
Worldline can make it fun
i went the wrong way on the jumping part..
I still need to do Whisper :PeepoDance:
I've given up for now
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/667154443661475860/668369698311634946/corridors_map_preview_1-19-2020_3am.png
"What's the point of this ""puzzle""?"
We don't know yet for sure
"Iwant2now, dunno what time it is for you so I'm not gonna ping you, but if you want help with Whisper of the Worm, just let me know"
Yeah Oath and Trisin took the entire clan through Whisper and it's catalyst runs when it first came out
"Highly recommended guide, 5/5"
And Ari too I think
think my record for hauling ass to the combat section was like.... 3 or 4 minutes?
I've been finshing up catalysts so many times in the infinite thrallway that I kinda don't remember the rest now lol
Also Whisper remains the only dungeon-like that I've solo-ed
I should probably try that
and Zero Hour
"It was easier with infinite reload, but Izanagi tears through them anyway"
I still want to do Niobe Labs and the Zero Hour fast completion
I've done Zero Hour once...
and hated it lol
It was with @Jeremy and @Kimarais/Nick :PepeAnnoyed:

"That's a bit old, it's missing the new sign next to the plus"
It's so...overwhelming
Sweatcicle has been running routes since yesterday: https://www.twitch.tv/sweatcicle
"btw, here's a version of the map with all the dead ends blocked off, to make it easier to find paths"
Do we have 5 people willing to sherpa me through Last Wish? I did watch videos but I only did Riven and the run.
I can't today but I can tomorrow.
"Definitely have enough people that can do it, maybe set up an lfg for sometime this week?"
Also what’s the raid challenge after Tuesday?
I just want a chance for 1k voices.
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 what days are good for you?
"@Crizum next raid challenge it's zero to one hundred, the one few people need it myself included.

I can play everyday, if we start around the usual time (8-9pm est) it's fine for me"
"That’s what I thought for challenges, @LW Mugetsu you wanna make the lfg for garden?"
what day?
"Any day works for me, just since you need the raid challenge figured you’d want to make it"
Maybe closer to 9 est though
supposed to be 8pm
"I think you can edit, ask @thegoaliebear"
should be `!lfg 155 edit time` ??
i'm not too sure the order for the command lol.
!lfg edit time 155
Now it says today though
now it should be good
"It looks good, thanks"
Okay and
to edit it's  !lfg edit <Section> <Join Id>
"@Destiny [PC] two lfgs up, LW for a first timer tomorrow and 0-100 GoS"
Oh man how...I forgot pm lol
!lfg edit 774
Thanks @Crizum
Looking forward to getting some of y’all Enlightened
Ron! When your internet gets better we’re getting you the flawless!
Yeah I got salty when I realized you were correct and the challenge must be done when it's in the rotation
It’s unfortunate that it’s a connection issue and not a skill one but we’ll get it
"Well actually I guess it’s better that it’s a connection issue, when you aren’t getting bad net we’ll be able to get you the flawless"
"that was rough getting through that, but i'm down to help Ron get it"
Im in too

"Very few options remaining, we're almost there I feel like"
||IT'S HAPPENING||
||Gladd and the data team have hit endgame of the map. The official map has been finished and they're running all possible options now||
:FeelsBadMan:
||WE DID IT BOIS||
||!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!||
||Damn. Looking to be really interesting||
||I'm SO CURIOUS what that core is for!!!||
||g j a l l a r h o r n||
"WEAPON SPOILER: ||It's for Bastion, apparently||"
I'm pretty sure it's not
||Seemed a bit different off the stream I saw||
"||I hope not, but people are saying it is. Then again, we're about to find out through Gladd. ||"
I want to stay up and follow but I have an 8am
I should go to sleep :(((
||It WOULD be weird for Bungie to put Bastion as the 28th and give it now||
||Evan managed to get the next step||
||I ran it and I didn't get the weapon core wtf||
||Bastion confirmed. What’s coming the 28th then??||
||Gonna be hilarious as shit when the good exotic was a few lines of text and the bad exotic was a huge community puzzle||
||Do you think Bastion will crush in Crucible? Looks like Lord of Wolves mixed with Erentil||
so...how much of this will we actually have to do for it?
"||You need to do the final code to get the quest, which is 30-symbols long. After that, all you need to do is runa strike and do Spider bounties||"
🙄
rip...not too bad since it's all done I guess tho.
"||Unless you're like me and can't get the quest to drop, despite running it three times||"
maybe it's bugged ??
"Yea, Sweatcicle ran into the same thing + other people on Reddit. Seems to be a 50/50 shot"
that's an oof lol.
||https://prnt.sc/qq8uyl||
||it seems to be pretty shitty for pve||
so then wth is coming on the 28th if you can get this already lol.
"It'll probably be available without the puzzle on the 28th, the whole puzzle being a way to get the weapon early"
if that's the case then bless lol.
"Gladd looked so devastated when he got it, felt kind of bad"
I mean it would be shitty if they did all this work and then it releases next week without the CoT needed at all.
https://twitter.com/gladdontwitch/status/1219237145027792896?s=21
that would be even shittier lol.
the reddit comments are just pure salt lmao.
Have you checked r/raidsecrets? It’s *bad*
|| https://gyazo.com/0632ca37d46083af5d081e91df827107 ||
"It is an underwhelming reward tbh, but seeing the community band together to solve the puzzle was fun. 10/10 puzzle, 3/10 reward"
"it's just shitty because like yeah, ||when it drops next week it will likely be without needing CoT||. which means all of that was like, unnecessary aha."
BUT THE LORE WE GATHERED ALONG THE WAY
|| https://gyazo.com/cd292ead2a50e106af879244d2363864 ||
"I’m a fool and am still hoping Bungie does something similar to the Last Wish raid, where the world changes somehow after the completion.

I know it won’t happen, but i want to believe"
|| https://youtu.be/FS2mAJcFfw4 ||
ok Bastion shreds in PvP
I won a game of rumble and people started running away when they saw me towrds the end lol
||https://twitter.com/bungie/status/1219304243242266626?s=21||
*o o f*
Bruh
||No reward would have made people happy lol||
"It's about the journey, not the destination"
"I quite like it, just wish they hadn't spoiled the gun itself"
"If they didn’t show Bastion, the reception would’ve been 1000% more positive"
LMAO.
"If people didn’t data mine it all to hell and assume they knew all the quest steps people wouldn’t have thought “couldn’t be this, must be this!”"
"Ah yes, because allowing the community to unlock something earlier than advertised is such an awful thing"
"honestly Bungo's puzzle team is pretty good, they just need to be utilized to better ends"
"It’s not an awful thing *at all*, and the puzzle was really fun. Just slightly underwhelming"
I just think what makes it bad is that it doesn't seem like you have to do any of the CoT once the quest is actually out.
There is still the lore
Well you might still need to run the lore steps and the emblem code if you want that
which renders all of that a massive waste of time unless you like getting lore.
from pve perspective it was kinda sad that we knew we would get bastion but it sucks how the weapon performs
Plus people needed to do it to unlock the puzzle
"Lol, yeah for me the lore is good enough for the whole thing to have been worth it"
Plus it's the first time I directly contributed to solving any big Destiny puzzle
"see, personally I don't care about getting lore in game from stuff like that. I can just go online and read the entries. but that's just me. I get that people enjoy lore hunting."
I'm like you @thegoaliebear
I was just hoping the weapon to be ok but meh
I never read a piece of lore on Ishtar archive or whatever  until I've unlocked it ingame
so to me it just seemed unfair to people doing it who might have thought they would get something else out of it aha.
yeah agreed
They set their own expectations lol
"Like the actual problem is that people were expecting something that hadn't been announced, and started making wild guessed about what it was 🤷‍♂️"
I want see Glad's face when he realized it was a Bastion step
I quite like the gun so far
Would have been hilarious though if they gave up and didn’t do the puzzle
And we just didn’t get bastion this season
Hilarious as shit if it requires all that work and is just a PvP shredder
I feel if people didnt break the puzzle they would make like same amount of rooms than it's for the emblem and quest wouls drop anyways at 28th
It *is* a PvP shredder
@Arixama oh I agree. people set their expectations way too high with a lot of things lol.
"I mean a quest like that on a grander scale than say Whisper or Outbreak to lead to a gun promised on the roadmap is kinda dumb imo. My understanding is that the quest would have been given out on the 28th, and yeah, this is cool to unlock it early but something that takes 5 days and people staying up for days to complete a puzzle for something we were already gonna get.... I dunno. Doesn't sit well with me. I respect other people's opinions though"
We weren't going to get it if the puzzle didn't get done
"Bungie tweeted its on the roadmap to let people know it’s coming, but apparently wasn’t set to drop on the 28th, just whenever the puzzle was finished this season"
Okay.... So then IMO it should have been advertised as such
If they didn’t roadmap it people would have data mined it anyway which I guess saves some surprise for some people
Nah they would drop it anyways because of consumer policy.
maybe by the end of the season instead of 28th
"Idk, if they tell you the reward for the puzzle there’s less incentive to figure it all out right?"
It'd be Niobe Labs - Bergusia forge situation once again
^^ probably yeah haha
it was fun tho... to see a bunch of people very commited
now we have a ton of salt on reddit
they would only be able to hold out on it for so long because it was set to release later in the season anyway and it's required for Savior lol.
When is the subreddit *not* filled with salt?
"Reddit is a salt mine, Bungie can’t even use paper bags without pissing off plastic bag mains"
I doubled my blood pressure medication just in case before read any of it
"Raid secrets has gotten *pretty bad*, though"
"yeah reddit is reddit haha. I mean...it was cool, but I wasn't expecting anything crazy to come of it. I just feel like it's unfair to the people who put in all those hours for it."
Glad got some INSANE amount of subs
I don’t feel one ounce of sympathy
"But at the same time, the initial roadmap made it seem like it was coming out on the 28th and this was unrelated. I don't think it's a great idea to mask it like that but like... That was their call.

As for it being a PvP ""shredder"" it's a shotgun that's hitscan and has charge up that occupies the kinetic slot, so you can't run Spare, Ace, Thorn, TLW, or other kinetic primaries and means you're looking at using energy primaries which don't have a lot of good choices for PvP in comparison to kinetic slot primaries."
"Dudes gonna make around 75k in payouts this month because Bungie put out a puzzle, so he can miss me with that “this was underwhelming” shit"
Everyone else can think that though haha
So because the puzzle results in something that he wasn't expecting but he gets money he can't have an opinion on if the puzzle sucks or not?
"Sorry, I don't agree with that take Crizum."
I think a lot of the times streamers set the tone
The streamers got a bunch of sub and the raid secrets community grew about 25 times its size from a single event
"By my tests, ttk on tribute hall ogre is 8s for bastion, 13s gallant, 11s telesto and 4s izanagi's"
"So yeah if the community rallied and came behind you to finish something, and all you can do is offer a shitty take after making bank? Yeah he can have an opinion but Jesus Christ"
"The problem is that the attitude seems to be ""this was a waste of time"" like you didn't choose this to be your job?"
My bae isnt going anywhere
"I watched some Datto say one and he was seriously moaning “I had *SO* much to do today, *sooooo* much”"
"You chose this as your job, Destiny isn’t on the level of Fortnite, go take a break if it’s getting so toxic"
"It’s been what, 6 days?"
You making 75k in six days playing a video game and your gonna tell me “yeah but it was a waste of my time”
How’s that not sound entitled?
Money is never enough
"it is entitled. at least for me, I just mean in terms of people who don't do it as their job. there were a lot of community members putting in their time for it, so I just felt kinda bad for them haha."
Yeah I can get that
"But like, Ron was involved and no offense @RonInDune but if he tweets out “that puzzle kinda sucked lol” it isn’t the same as a Datto/Sweatcicle doing it"
"Okay. So the ""you do this as a job"" argument is frustrating to me because yeah, it's their job, so if they're frustrated with the state of the game and they spend this much time on something that is on a grander scale than that of previous hidden quests for something that we expected as a standalone quest, not related to this at all, why shouldn't they be frustrated and annoyed at the amount of effort relating to payoff *in terms of the puzzle*. Yes, Gladd got a shitton of subs. Yeah, he's gonna be making bank but him and the other people involved can say that it sucked. It took them days to solve it, requiring 5000 unique puzzle pieces that could be duplicated often by unique players, they were expecting some secretive reward instead of something that was already promised."
"That's just my take on it, I respect your opinions, I just don't really agree."
"And I mean that’s fine, perhaps it’ll always be a generational thing when it comes to streamers playing games as a job"
"I’ll agree that it would have been cool if Bungie didn’t have bastion on the road map, but even if they didn’t it would have been data mined to all hell and we’d likely have the same end result"
"Speaking of data-mining, isn't there an ||exotic rocket launcher|| that was data-mined? I know people thought *that* would've been the reward"
There’s apparently a ||returning solar rocket launcher|| referred to by some sting of text in the ||catalysts||
So would it have been better if at the end of it everyone was gifted ||Dragon’s Breath||?
||pls no||
I like dmg’s explanation on the topic of a secret mission leading to a roadmap exotic
https://twitter.com/a_dmg04/status/1219293640758972422?s=21
"People were literally streaming for days pushing themselves to exhaustion, and as far as I've heard some streamers were refusing to attempt progress unless people were subbing, so forgive me if I'm a little bit jaded about streamers complainong the payoff wasn't worth it"
Okay but those streamers are assholes plain and simple
My thoughts on this :PepeAnnoyed: :
raidsecrets bringing their a game in complaints
"|| This is nitpicky but Saint-14 describes the ""mystery weapon"" as our favorite gun. OUR FAVORITE GUN. If this gun is mediocre or bad, Bungie just put into CANON that Bastion was our Guardians FAVORITE GUN. How presumptuous is that??? And we all know that if this gun kicks ass, it's just gonna be nerfed in a couple months and no ones gonna use it again.||"
"I saw that one. Not a valid complaint. Hilarious, yes, but not valid."
Not commenting on the validity I just thought it was great

"Ok, Bastion is surprisingly good in pvp. Probably a bit broken."
ALREADY?
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
|| https://gyazo.com/5beb0290308f1f0992a4e26720f89562 ||
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
not surprised hahaha.
this guy is in my game
"Some SPICY takes in the Destiny subreddit today, dear lord."
Imagine thinking Activision is a good company
Imagine thinking this puzzle situation is anything like eververse
I think Bungie is seriously missing Vicarious Visions
They're the one who designed most of the Dreaming City and Black Armoury stuff didn't they?
Plus the Warmind/Rise of Iron aesthetic
That's why the loss of Activision hit them hard
"Honestly they are a what, 700 person team? It shouldn’t have hit them as hard as it did assuming they actually have people working on D2"
They are working on another IP too
"That’s fair, but we aren’t playing that other ip haha"
"okay but Vicarious Visions, High Moon Studios, and the other supplementary studios Activision had allowed them to create more content with less of an issue"
"VV was some 250-ish people, plus they also lost High Moon"
THat's more than a quarter of their total lost
Criz.... a new IP takes a lot of resources for studios. Just because we're playing Destiny and not whatever else they're cooking up doesn't mean it's not a resource drain
this is an interesting topic
"because looking at bungie's office, it looks HORRIBLE for productivity"
"No my point is that that other IP is taking resources away from D2, but if it’s leaving D2 in the current limbo where nobody seems happy that’s 100% on Bungie"
"ah, fair."
They have their eye on the future and I understand that
yeah fully agreed
But that’s the choice they made
Until that IP is in our hands it means literally nothing to me
See all they need to do to get back to their best is make a sequel to Oni
The greatest game ever made
"Because to me Destiny traded on the promise from Halo, and Destiny 2 traded on the promise of what D1 was able to become, but I don’t know how much more I’m willing to trade on the promises when D2 is what it is you know?"
would people who made Oni still work at bungie
"I still like the game, I’ll play whatever they have, but they’ve lost some luster for me is all"
I just wish they would let us know what the thought process behind some of their decisions
They want to become a publisher
"""30 seconds of fun stretched to a whole game"""
that was a good philosophy to live by
dunno if it's true anymore
"Because Destiny is really losing steam for me. I don't touch it nearly as much these days. I want to know why they thought changing X to A, and Y to Z, or leaving something alone from a balancing perspective and then yeeting something else into the void of ""this sucks now"" a few days after it gets a buff, or other WTF moments in recent months"
"yeah the only thing I'll do these days is just enough gambit to get the season title, and practice PvP to get Lunas someday"
"Just, if they show off their new game at some point in the next two years and you hear the words “core gameplay” “return to basics” “our history of X” take a shot ok"
"I don't even play PvP anymore. SBMM sucks the fun out of it for the most part, and I don't care to get Unbroken because these days according to a lot of people, Unbrokens are just automatically shitbags and treat people like ass (sentiments from other servers I'm in)"
They’ve almost listened to the community too much I think haha
"I mean on the other end of the spectrum, they've not listened to us before and that's resulted in the community being just as pissed off"
"I guess the better phrasing is, they listened but they didn’t hear"
"Bungie can't seem to balance anything, be it Crucible, community expectations for a puzzle, whether the should or shouldn't listen to the community, which parts of the community to cater to, etc. (Kind of joking)"
Yeah I can agree with that
"I'd argue that overall Bungie has improved on those points, yet the areas Bungie falters in only make things worse because of those steps forward."
"I mean personally speaking.... Crucible is relatively unfun for me these days when i do play. Some things are overtuned and have been left alone, other things should be retuned to make them better but haven't, HC archetypes are all the same in terms of drawbacks other than fire rate, so why not pick 150s because the other 3 don't really offer any reason to use them. Then there's things like the artifact mods, or the new seasonal mods that allow for some weird shit to go on in PvP. I don't like the battery mods. The solar Thundercoil equivalent is frustrating. It just goes on and on.

The Crucible improved from Y1 to Y2. I'd argue that it's almost only stagnated from about Black Armory on."
That's just speaking for Crucible though.
I will say that I quite enjoy most of the new content that Bungie has put out in recent months.... it's just that other things are really being exposed as lackluster
Maybe I'm just burnt out and too cynical about it at this point. I don't really know.
Best thing to do is probably an extended break?
honestly yeah
The game is more fun for me when I take time off and play something else for a bit
Maybe try this excellent new looter-shooter game:
* **Anthem** *
I have been taking a break. Lately been getting on just to do a few things. Mostly bounties.
"Even with that, it can start to feel like a chore"
"I want to hit 100 for the seasons because I made the mistake of getting the deluxe edition of Shadowkeep, meaning I want to hit 100 for the next two seasons, including this one"
Oh it does
Oh yeah haha I can feel that
That doesn't really burn me out because I can work on other shit during bounty hell as I've come to call it
That's ones of the biggest things I'm dreading.
I’m only 100+ because it took some time in between jobs for me to find something
"I tend to forget to grab bounties when doing things, so going out of my way and getting that done can just be frustrating."
Once that’s over I doubt I’ll have the desire to bang out 100 levels
I do the extra boring strat of doing an eternity's worth of Eris bounties.
"Do that with a podcast or Spotify on in the background, that was my method"
I should probably do that.
"Also, Bastion is crazy fun to use in pvp."
"Oh I do, usually work on calculus or something else, otherwise my brain just shuts off entirely."
Brain shut off is my goal haha
Kill a few hours without it feeling like an eternity
"That being said, integral calculus makes my fucking brain hurt because it's *too far fucking backwards from what I know about calculus*"
@Destiny [PC] ^^ anyone for a 6th for sure? would be Sar's first time through LW.
"i can probably come, just ping me in discord"
what time did we want to start?
9 EST.

this is the riven sword cheese
for people who didn't do CoT for Bastion were you able to pick it up from saint 14 without any issue?
https://gyazo.com/eb24c704a9746cabeee07ac078841cb0
i see..
I had to...
posted it on reddit
like jesus christ
There's some dope Hunter looks this season ngl
(from https://twitter.com/KobOneArt/status/1219708127366590465)
This is what I've been rocking if I want to look all fancy on my Hunter
smooth
very high fashion Indiana Jones there
Just not so happy with the chest armor but it's the closest fit so
"hmm, maybe last season's Iron Banner?"
Don't have a good roll on it (this armor is also functioning as my shotgunning set of gear)
"When grinding for Python I had a full shotgun loadout with double shotgun mods on every piece, but I looked horrifying and got sniped by invaders constantly"
I had a big back pack that strike.
is anyone up for IB tonight?
thats a really big backpack
yeah. graviton lance and the resulting explosion cause more and more. I ends up being just one big group of explosions and that's how you end up with those stupidly high numbers
for anyone who hasn't gotten the bastion any of the wanted spider bounties count towards it's completion
whats the best way to grind to season rank 100?
"turn in weekly bounties while teamed up, as well as farm moon bounties afterward"
keyword is: bounties
not moon bounties......
Make sure to have a guiding light ghost as well. Gotta make everything count haha
We have a spot open for our garden run tonight
Would y’all be down to do the second encounter triumph as well? That and 0 to 100 is all I need for Enlightened
*plus the hunter cloak but we don’t talk about that*
I don't mind doing it just curious.
Repulsion Theory: summon the Consecrated Mind without tethering to the relay while Enlightened
Oh yeah. That's not to hard.
But we still need a 6th
Unfortunately I'm in class rn and won't be done for another 2 hours ish :((
good luck tho!
I'm down for the second encounter triumph @Peronix
I'm only missing 0 to 100 but I dont remember doing repulsion theory
"@LW Mugetsu damn, I forgot to make coffee... I'll be a few minutes late"
@everyone we need a sixth for the raid
still need one?
"nevermind, just realized you guys are doing GoS, havent ever completed it yet"
"I would be down, but it is a challenge and it is my first run :PepeShrimp: 

So I would accidentally mess it up"
"I'm sure you guys would be fine @Saint 14's loyal follower @AhRealMonsters , it's a pretty easy raid and they are experienced and happy to teach I'm sure"
Even if we don't get it done you more than welcome to join
You'll have 2 certified sherpas ✅
"@Saint 14's loyal follower called it first, so dibs gets first decision"
"Just let me know and if not, I can join"
"Did you want to join on them, @Saint 14's loyal follower ?"
Okie dokie
unless you really want too
"Nah man, you're good. Go ahead"

well I have made it through the first round of applicants to the final pool and yesterday got invited to the interview days for one of the doctoral programs I applied to😄
"@thegoaliebear congrats, I hope you get it"
"@thegoaliebear @Crizum @Trissin do you guys have some free time to do 0 to 100 challenge this week?Me, Mugetsu and Peronix are missing it for enlightened."
holy cow @thegoaliebear congrats!!! You got this!!
thanks guys💟
only night I'd really be up for that is Sunday night @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
I'm trying to sleep more this week haha been exhausted and Saturday I will just be doing fractaline bounties. but Sunday night I should be free.
"@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 I think I could make a little time, sorry about last night, can explain more Sunday."
"@Crizum Don't worry about last night, it was good to give more experience to the new guys"
and if Thawxtem is far enough along in the divinity quest and no has a problem with it we may add that in as well
currently going through the lost sectors now
"well, Vex Offensive is no more... any ideas on where to kill lots of vex (that isn't the raid)?"
"Lost sector on Nessus, by the izanami forge, the one lost sector on mercury"
nessus
I think crizum is talking about 2 good sectors to farm vex
one and nessus and another on mercury
Those are also my go-to vex farms lol
"Yeah haha, specifically the one by izanami forge/that cabal public event (I forget the name, Artifacts Edge?) or the one lost sector on mercury, which the name doesn’t matter cause mercury is so small and only has the one lost sector"
There is also one a few on Io but they are further from the spawn points
"If you are lucky you can get the vex public event by Failsafe, but it could also be ether harvest"
okay... I'm killing vex and getting zero progress
Does the quest specifically call out “on the moon”?
"""Sol Divisive Vex""?"
best clue I have
Yeah that’s gonna have to be in the raid
if it is on the moon then just keep loading into the raid and killing the vex that spawn at the start.
"Or the raid portal entrance, you should be able to get there by loading in to sorrows harbor and going back to the place where you initially got the quest"
"For the Vex kills for Divinity, @Jeremy and I did the Nightmare Hunt for the Vex on the moon"
CORRECT
I don’t know if it is still in rotation in that area though
Its not
BUT
:PepeShrimp:
You can go to the moon
And go to that area anyways
Same way you pick up the quest
"Kill them, walk out of the zone and reset it"
Makes it easier
Instead of having the load times for the raid. 🤷🏽‍♂️
"This time, I really am ready to do Divinity portion in the raid. I double checked, to be safe"
@Thawxtem me and you both
Remember to brush up on your geometry
We did all the puzzles last night so we should be alright
So if you run double special in Gambit (Mountaitop/Jötunn) you get an absurd amount of heavy ammo
"I was killing normal ads with Hammerhead and still had >50% ammo at the end of games, all without running a single heavy ammo finder"
ok so this'll make getting bounties for Izanagi's much easier:
That's messed up for people who had to wait forever for that rare bounty lol
I can finally get blacksmith lol
Now if I can get Anarchy I will finally have completed two of the Collections page items: Exotics and Lore
Oh I do need that raid sparrow still
lol I'll trade you the raid sparrow and 3 Tarrabahs for Anarchy
I got the sparrow but not anarchy
I'm cursed to not get it until @Thawxtem does
cleared final boss like 2 times on each char
got the sparrow in a run with y'all
"Honestly I don't have that many clears, around 28-ish"
only run from the start that I did
I know it has taken some people >50 runs
Ron you have 28 clears???
Damn that's getting unlucky yeah
"Yeah, we were doing 3x boss clears weekly pretty regularly for a bit there"
that's right
I don't think Goalie got it either
"But @Crizum did, as did a bunch of others"
oh yeah I remember crizum and criz both got it on that one run lol
The Criz-es have become too powerful
I accept that trade 😛
"I also need the armor 2.0 versions of taken, fallen, and hive armaments still"
that's gonna be annoying to grind out
I have Fallen and Hive
Hive armaments is easy enough to grind out form Menagerie
Got it in two weeks of 3 runs on each character
I've been going to the free Chest in Last Wish every week 3x but still don't have Taken armaments
I got 2x 1kv before I got taken armaments
I know Ari got it running chests
"Trissin, you've done solo Whisper and stuff, yeah?"
how hard did you find it to be?
But not since armor 2.0
it's kinda hard but not too bad with the right loadout
taken and fallen armaments carried me
"I mean, I've done solo Whisper, so it's not that difficult"
As did old Ursa Furiosas
Same as Trissin
I think I'm gonna do solo Whisper and Zero Hour
At least try it
Zero Hour is *hard*
I don't have armaments is the only thing lol
ursas are still my favorite exotic armor
What about the 1.0 version
Don't have either of them
For Zero Hour it took me so long to clear the 3rd room that I always ran out of time in the boss arena
I'm thinking double special for Zero Hour
Is that the one with small servitors and the one walker
"For combat sections, with Anarchy for DPS"
idk about double special
"Unless one is like, meant for ad clear"
Riskrunner is super good tho
Maybe mountaintop+riskrunner combo
riskrunner is real good but it *chews* through its fucking reserves
I think there are enough ads in the boss room to supply riskrunner ammo
but then it comes down to DPS plus shields
But I mean honestly I would use anarchy too
Anarchy is sooooo good
fire and forget
Unnerfed skull of dire ahamkara would destroy
I'm just trying to theorize what I'd need
Wonder if Bastion would be good
for the shield bypass
Probably gonna start running some of the higher tier NFs if I get high enough gear to be useful in them
Arbalest works well for shield breaking.
btw I had a guy with a Not Forgotten with >1000 kills in Iron Banner today
Dude was super chill on mic and kept guiding us on what to do
Carried the hell out of us too
"people like that exist, they're chill"
Cause that's what real gamers do
dude kept popping bubbles with Helm of S-XIV to save us
wish we had someone like that every game
"hmm, if you run something like Xenophage and a heavy finisher mod, that'd output a tonne of damage"
Especially now with the buff Xenophage got
Might even break through the shields
I should use that gun more
"I hate that gun, it shreds so much 😢"
A Gambit invader kept using it lol
How good is the Lumina bonus in PvP? Is it worth running?
Depends on the game mode and the weapons getting buffed by it.
In comp?
"Riskier since it relies on teammates, but can work"
"I was wondering if running a full healing build is worth it, with well of radiance, max grenade and lumina"
Just stay alive and help others stay alive
Do your teammates tend to be better or worse than you?
Better
Then go for it
👍🏽
Starfire Protocol for double healing grenades can also work out quite nicely with it
"oh nice, I completely forgot about that exotic"
"It has some merit, for example, I believe any high impact sniper will 1hit to the body with the buff"
Even with the full overshield?
"It's like inertia override, or kill clip on Tatara"
Just imagine that given to a Revoker. Literally no downside to going for bodyshots for 10 seconds or so.
I wish Lumina was energy so I could run Revoker alongside
"But I'm going to give this support build a shot, thanks guys!"
"Any time, and please do let me know how it goes."
🤞🏽
hmm feels like this could have gone better
"but I'm not known to give up, so onwards to glory!!!"
ok I give up
"If you want, I could run comp with you to help make that loadout work out."
"Busy right now, but I'm free during the weekend."
"Might take you up on the offer, there's possibilities there"
"I'm done for the night anyway, way too salty right now lol"
Gotcha.
"Despite my incredibly bad kda, I am proud to say I am in the top 6% of deaths in D2 PvP"
Truly a magnificent achievement

"So for example, I'd give you an id of 123456789012345, you'd then paste that as /join 123456789012345"

"So I just did CoS, and I realized: other than getting stomped on once during the second stage and failed attempts at a challenge, I never died. This means I feel confident enough to try a flawless run for once. This is something I would rather do with people I know rather than random people who expect to get flawless first try. That being said, are there any people here who also feel confident with flawless CoS that might try it with me sometime?"

i never said it was a bad thing
bmw's are amazing cars
thats hot
"the new supra is clean, but id do awful things for a late 90's supra"

I did some LFG heroic Sundial and it didn't drop

"""Suggestions for the Developer"""
"1) Please get rid of the stupid noise being sung on the start screen.
Presumably it's meant to be both annoying and funny, but it's only annoying (actually it's high-pitched, out of tune, and highly annoying).

2) I would suggest that the game be configured so that players start with a SMG already equipped (when I first started, I was wondering how to get a gun, and I can see from the Steam discussions that I wasn't the only one with this problem).

3) Please, please, please, put in an on/off button, or a volume slider, so that the background music can be turned off, or at least turned down - it's quite annoying to be spammed with the same music repeating throughout the game (you can barely hear the gunfire, let alone any other in-game sounds)."

got kind of derailed from the raid
we went down a rabbit hole tonight
All I see are a bunch of hentai games
this will the rick roll
we need  to make an emoji
it was all in voice mostly
peronix streamed hentai nazi over discord
I'm so upset that I wasn't around for this
I tried to @ you
"yeah, I saw ty"
its okay @Trissin
But that was before I mentioned Hentai Sniper:Middle East and derailed everything
yea Crizum sent us into the darkness
he brought you into the light
we were  not ready
the rabbit hole is seemingly infinite
"if you would like to experience hentai nazi for yourself, it's only 84 us cents on steam"

And this is why it's important for all the memes to migrate here
How else would y'all have been introduced to hentai nazi?
is there any triple infamy coming up?
I'd bet either this week or next week. Don't they closely follow double valor?
yeah I think so. like... I'm close to heroic for my buddy but would love that triple infamy to get him past fabled😂
Oh shit you doin gambit later @thegoaliebear ?
yeah I'll be on ps4 on my buddy's account.
"Hit me up, I gotta grind out the quests"
alright for sure👍
"DOn't forget to stock up on completed Gambit bounties btw, they give triple infamy too"
That's how I got my 3 resets in a season
There is a triumph for 3 resets in a season?
thankfully I don't need any resets.
For getting Dredgen I think
It doens't have to be 3 in a season
just doing all the seasonal  quests to get my buddy Savior.
Back when gambit launched you needed three in one season to get it
But you could do three over three seasons
"So I might play some gambit, Im couple matches away for second reset"

@Trissin and @Buttkikker did it a way back
they can give you some tips
"It might take some getting used to, but I'm confident you can get it @Sarsante - 76561197967628966"
"I've just accepted that when I solo queue gambit, my teammates are going to be potatoes 98% of the time. so I don't mind it as much now and just worry about myself in it lol."
"Especially now that you have experience with flawless GoS, you kind of get a better understanding of how to play safe and always be ready to get behind some cover"
"My gambit loadout is double special: mountaintop and Jötunn, along with Hammerhead"
"It's foolproof, especially since you get so much heavy ammo drops"
I literally had one guy the other day who would not shoot anything and just stand behind me then rush in to steal all the motes lmao
@Trissin that room is pretty hard on hunter. Maybe warmhusk can help idk. I might try with warlock
"I see, it's definitely more challenging on a hunter for sure"
Wormhusk and invisibility do seem like a good way to go
But I haven't put much thought into it
"Yeah I'll try that and liars handshake with top tree, melee kills get you hp"
"This is my typical game lol, from yesterday:"
"None of us killed the primeval, we won because we had done more damage"
That 25 kill guy had me tearing my hair out
I literally feel that so hard hahaha.
That's tilting
btw what was he using? sniper rifle?
nah that new rocket launcher
Deathbringer
He definitely brought death
It's worse than even Truth
"oh wow, that's really interesting"
Yeah that little ball of death from Deathbringer literally chased me across the map
lol that's crazy
absolute crazy

I want to go climbing again and not be in class *reeeeeeee*
"@Oathbreaker If your class is on the second floor, I have a brilliant suggestion on how you can do both"

Don't underestimate those lanterns lol
"yeah, i was going for the third witch and opsie"
The first time I tried it I got killed by the ogres after that encounter was completed and I was already in the room
I've been scared to try... I've never been in the PoH before. Does it take long with a fireteam?
Takes around 45 mins-ish
"Similar to Shattered Throne, though the encounters are easier"
Plus I love the aesthetics of it
I think my fastest was around 25 minutes
but usually 40 minutes
I hate post season practices

that's fucking gold
Yeah it's not on mine too
someone is getting in trouble
"Prime stuff is usually unspectacular though, so I doubt it'll be anything good"
I want it to be new ornaments or ships/sparrows
This would be the best way to bring back Gjallarhorn
I want Bungie to commit
"It;s the Arcadia ship, but instead of it taking shaders, it's just covered in a JPEG of Jeff Bezos"
Yeah it wouldn't be anything spectacular
probably just an exotic engram and maybe some primes because y'know..... Twitch Prime
New 1k voices ornament-Kreygasm
a pinacle reward would be great
Skins for crucible weapons like recluse/LH/MT-Kappa OMEGALUL and residentsleeper
I can't wait for Reddit to complain about this. *proof Destiny is pay-to-win*-20k upvotes
honestly r/DestinyTheGame has become unbearably bad lately
I've unsubscribed
I don't think it's been this bad since Curse of Osiris tbh
Pretty much everywhere is bad lately when it comes to destiny tbh
WONDER WHY
r/Destiny2 has too many memes but it's good
"r/LowSodiumDestiny is good, if not a bit slow"
"remember that one post where the dude said ""I'm not a hardcore player I got to 120k triumph score on accident"" and then went on to rant about how bad this season was😂"
I gotta find that post. it was too good.
I half-heartedly want to grind for the seasonal armor ornaments but like.... I'm only rank 30 LOL
"here it is. if yall want to read a massive joke😂😂😂
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ejo4i3/its_not_franchise_fatigue_for_crazy_players_like/"
"The main issue is that the subreddit takes one (legitimate) complaint, then exaggerates the problem until it's nothing but whining"
"Eververse complaints = legitimate. Saying Eververse has ruined the game, burned down our crops and killed our families = not legitimate"
Idk I don’t have any crops...
*I saw Bungie pour gasoline over our yard*
MY MILKSHAKES
"I just find it funny bc a majority of the time all those people complaining are like, still dumping hours into the game every day."
"Also, saw a comment saying that Destiny is garbage now, and they know this because they were once a ""5,000 grimoire beta player"""
Bungie decided to cater to the every day player
"That was the goal Luke stated, so that’s why people are raking them over the coals on not enough content"
Plus I think if you cater to the every day the people who don’t log in all the time get left behind and complain so someone is always bitching
People are mad at the corridors of time going away
"I think they're trying to figure out the perfect balance, and this whole seasonal idea was one of their ways to do it. Is it successful? Idk, not my place to say"
How do you cater to both casuals and hardcore players?
"Without upsetting one of them, of course"
"oh for sure. honestly I didn't mind that this season was made for more casual players. I'll always love the game but I've been enjoying playing other things. the post by that dude trying to say he didn't have franchise burnout and then goes on to explain *literally why he has franchise burnout* is just like, the epitome of how hypocritical people on reddit are."
I think that guy was doing a meta post about the community being whiny
"I don't think they have the right balance. Not enough of meaningful grind or things to do. Just seems kinda tedious for things like Randy's or other ""pinnacles"""
Least that’s how I read it
"like, if you have done all the content within a given season and now have a break between content stuff for the season title or whatever, it's totally fine to break from it until then."
They probably can’t do it without another overhaul but they should take some stuff from MH
Imagine actually forging our armors and weapons from base models
I feel like people legit force themselves to play it when they've done all they need to do in the game for a given time just so they can complain about it lol.
"I don't know, I think the community would complain about how grindy that is"
"Probably, but it’s a long term goal and the people that would make those high end armors will have put a ton of time in"
"I still remember that one post of a dude claiming Black Armory is the best state Destiny has ever been because of the grind, even though the subreddit complained about that same grind when Black Armory was active"
lmaooo yeah. people are always gonna complain. only reason I go on the subreddit anymore is to get a good laugh out of them.
I just use r/destinycirclejerk. Basically the same thing
"Right now I just don't like how there really isn't content that is exciting. Sundial was cool for like... one week. The story this season has been absolutely amazing, so  I don't mind it. But the actual content has been kinda middling. Not quite lackluster, not quite decent/good. I wish I had useful suggestions for Bungie but I don't these days."
yeah I mean personally I haven't minded it. been playing other games and I'm getting Savior for one of my buddies so.  it's an excuse to play even more haha.
I've been going climbing at a local climbing gym. Absolutely love it. Physically challenging and mentally trying to plan out the routes
nice our student wellness center has a rock climbing wall. gonna be hitting that up when our season ends lol.
"It's good to find other activities outside of Destiny. For example, I've been playing this indie gem called Raid Shadow Legends"
lmaooo but yeah I've been happy to get into other games.
"Yeah I started swimming again, plus I'm catching up on my backlog of Indie games"
"I was playing Journey and Gris, both of which are sublime"
The Veist ghost shell looks *so* sad
The update is ~300 MB
"What I dislike pretty much about every game is that I'm a minority so games are never tailored to people like me. I play only one game at time and I play a lot, I like to do the hardest content. I dont mind fail 200 times until I can finally beat it. But most people find said content super hard and don't even try, so they complain it's too hard"
"as business it's not profitable make games for people like me, I get it"
Uh...I suddenly have no glimmer
"I now have 6,000"
Bungo knows your sins
Gladd's chat is going crazy about it. Apparently a bunch of people lost materials
"Oh yeah, my inventory is looking a lot lighter"
*bungie meant it when they said they'd take away content*
"Oh, they added a notification for when a goblin sacrifices"
jesus 😂
"I didnt lost glimmer, I'm not sure about other stuff in inventory tho, I hardly keep track of a bunch of things I've there"
https://prnt.sc/qu4vwx
Bungie giveth and they taketh
showing us who's boss.
"now you can invite people from orbit instead of go to  roster, like why  waste time on that? idk"
lets say you click tower and that shows up
they fixed banshee weekly bounty
HARD LIGHT IS SO MUCH BETTER
There's like no recoil scoped in
"And less screen shake, of course"
Looks like according to the app I *only* lost most of my glimmer
Better than the prisms and shards others lost I suppose
"I haven't lost much according to DIM, but I guess I'll find out soon"
All I really care about is getting the final Moon lore
It seems I didnt lost anything important and I believe everything is here
Apparently happens when you log in Ron
"Ron: *logs in*

Bungie: ""So you have chosen death"""
Every single patch
There's a bullet point in the patch notes that just says Crucible
I lost all my CHarges of light
You could say these are *dark* times
I'm just happy I didn't lose my 5k fractaline
yeah it seems they fixed the loading death in PoH
All lore pieces done!!
I have finally completed Destiny and can rest in peace
"Damn, congrats!"
*for now*
Ominous
You completed the lore
But at what cost
"Ron: *completes lore*

Bungie:"
"Now all I need is Anarchy, then I can finally rest"
Wait I had lost all my Modulus reports and phantasmal fragments
You can get them back when you subscribe to twitch prime
Thankfully i had full stacks waiting in the postmaster
I lost like half my rally banners
I don’t want to log in now. 😔
I'm not going to log in either
So far it looks like if you don't log in it doesn't happen
Just looking on from my DIM
so take that with a grain of salt
Dmg said there’s potential for them to take the game offline soon so they can fix it
yup I got that message
*when you have to reset the reset*
I think Savathûn has infiltrated our reality and is taking out Bungo's servers
We broke the time line real bad
They released Savathun in 2012. We’ve been living in her world for almost a decade
@RonInDune  congrats!
Im missing a ton of them
"The annoying thing is due to the Seasonal model, there's a bunch of lore that can no longer be collected"
"Yea, I have one piece of Kraken Mare lore I forgot to get. Now it sits there, taunting me"
I think they won’t count it against the total usually?
"Like if you get locked out of 19 pieces of lore you wouldn’t sit at 400/419, you’d be at 400/400 and someone with the lore would be 419/419"
"Im curious to check my progression but everything is offline rn, they're probably rolling back inventories"
True it would probably be like the Dawning etc. triumphs
Hey @RonInDune check if you still have the Pigeon and the Phoenix lore book
Some people are reporting they lost it
Is the game back up yet?
"Oh hmm dunno, check the api since that’s still up"
my app couldn't even authenticate so I think it's not there yet
"it's offline, just tested"
"Intersting, I can connect to the manifest and get world status, but DIM can't"
We believe we have identified the cause of this issue and are working on a fix internally. Destiny 2 will continue to be offline until we have a better understanding of the timeline for this fix. We will provide another update by 12 PM Pacific.
I feel bad for their devs oof
"yeah, not a very good day to be a bungie dev"
Massive Datamined Spoilers here
"I wonder how many times ""rollback"" has been said in the past 90 minutes inside bungie HQ"
Hahahahaha
Season based off ||PvP||? @thegoaliebear are you OK?
"||trial of osiris its a pvp mode, right?||"
"Seriously folks, massive spoilers in those two pics"
Yeah Sar
rip then
||I was expecting a new raid not some broken pvp mode||
||Time for a a PvP raid||
||Time to learn Hunter||
||Time to surrender all honour and embrace the Contraverse Holds||
||While you were holding the walls I was studying the arc staff. While you were studying untold mysteries I was learning the path of the wraithstalker. And now that the season is based off PvP you have the audacity to ask for my help?||
||I just click heads. Give me a reason to and I will gladly do so.||
||Hard carry us to the seasonal title plz||
I will never take off Jotunn
"||LOL. I'm washed as hell right now. Besides, you don't want to even touch the skill bracket I'm in. All I see is meta. Nothing else lol.||"
@Crizum if that's the case I will barely be playing next season.
talk about a sure way to drive out a majority of the player base lmao.
"||To be fair that’s all I see usually as well, I’ve played with various clan members and we always get the sweats||"
"||What if they make the new trials a PvE thing, piss EVERYONE off||"
||50000 bits target to *only* play Crucible next season ||
"@RonInDune more like 500,000"
Hmmmmmmmmm
Time to cash in my bit coin investments
😂😂😂
but for real something like that would push me away from the game for basically that entire season.
"@thegoaliebear  same for me, sadly"
yeah...that would not be a good move for the game at all.
||I doubt that’s all they would do for the season but who knows||
I wouldn't put it past them😂
"""how do we get people to actually play this""

""let's just force them into it for an entire season"""
"||I myself highly doubt they would solely focus on Trials, and that's coming from a PvP player. It tends to be the red-headed step child of sorts of Destiny these days, so in my mind, they'll have Trials to appease people like me while giving PvE content but who knows. It may be Trials of the PvE encounters.||"
glad I have my wine class now so I can drink to forget even the notion ||of a season entirely about pvp||
"Genuine question: what would make you guys happy about playing PvP? Hell, not even *happy*, but instead okay with playing PvP?"
literally nothing.
"give me $5,000 and I'll tolerate playing it."
"I quite like it already, all that would improve my experience is me getting gud"
I genuinely don't enjoy it. never have. never will.
"Okay, secondary question then for you specifically Goal.... why do you hate it so much? I'm curious more than anything, not trying to be antagonistic"
I've never enjoyed it even in D1. always thought it was trash.
"like, I just don't feel any connection to it or any want to play it."
Does it stem from not enjoying the meta? or something different than that?
it's one of those things they could remove entirely from the game and I would probably not even notice lmao.
I honestly can't even say what it is. it's just garbage to me.
"Not for everyone, so fair enough."
"Like I said, not trying to be a pain, more or less just wondering why you don't like it so much"
I go play BO4 and absolutely shred kids there and then go into crucible and it's just...so slow and boring to me. I think there are way too many crutches for average players. way too many bitch loadouts.
not saying the same doesn't exist in BO4. there are several crutch things for average players to make themselves decent. but I enjoy how fast paced that gameplay is.
"ah, I see. You're used to faster paced TTKs (it's even lower than Destiny, which is a slight touch under average from what I remember) so this must feel absolutely glacial to you"
"And yeah, there's a lot of cheese/crutch shit in D2, I won't pretend it's super competitive and there isn't bullshit"
yeah hahaha I think that's probably the biggest thing for me if I had to try and single something out as why I don't enjoy it.
"I have the opposite issue haha, I like the ttk in Halo"
"CoD was too twitchy no-scope for me, but I haven’t played that since MW2"
"Fair enough Goal, I can respect being used to a faster paced set of play. I used to play Titanfall so that TTK was pretty nuts at times. Destiny is slower, and while I enjoy Halo, I like the middle ground Destiny has."
"I also respect that Criz, Halo's TTK does allow for gunplay turnarounds and the like"
Destiny has too many variables for me as well in crucible I feel like
"honestly out of all the CoDs I've played, BO4 feels really good. even tho there are some clearly OP things in it, you can be super successful with like, nearly every single gun in the game."
"So Goal, would you be happier with the sandbox if more weapons were viable?"
"I think if they made a mode in crucible where there were no abilities, supers, exotic armor perks...just a bare bones, solely gunplay mode, maybe with just grenades, I'd play that."
Honestly the only gunplay I miss is Quake
That’s what I thought Momentum Control was going to be
"People will rush to the cheesiest loadout, understandable, but with the various stat breakpoints, weapon mods and rolls etc it isn’t conducive to “ive got 45 minutes a night let me hop on for some PvP”"
I could personally say the same about PvE.
And that’s fair
"idk...it really is just like, nothing about it is enjoyable for me."
You shouldn’t have to raid for a god roll PvP weapon
"Again, fair enough, really, I was just curious"
Actual servers
"Idk, the only issue I have with PvP is one-hit abilities (hunter knife, shoulder charge, handheld supernova). Irritates me too much"
"Most of my issues, because I love the core gameplay of destiny, spring from p2p"
hunter knife at least you have to aim for the headshot haha.
"But with p2p you kinda don’t lol, cause they have to compensate"
the hit box with shoulder charge is absolutely ridiculous. I've been like 20 feet above a dude and gotten killed by their charge.
"And with shoulder charge you sometimes go through people, probably cause of lag"
"Still, unless it comes from a sniper, fusion or power weapon, it shouldn’t obliterate your health bar"
oh I agree aha.
Idk if contraverse has the same issues of not getting kills you should have and getting some bullshit in your favor haha
But if I have to question “was that skill or NA internet” I’m taken out of the game and not having fun
I don't think I would ever enjoy destiny pvp for the simple fact that a balanced competitive game would have most things that make destiny be destiny removed
While servers are still down you can laugh a bit https://youtu.be/3mcfBGq31j4
aww good on them for trying
I suspect if I try parkour I'll be considerably worse
That's recorded in a small countryside city
Yeah I would be worse but I would never do on tv
True that lol
Y'all know what we can do while we wait?
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085510/Garfield_Kart__Furious_Racing/
It's almost time for Bungo's update
"If you play Geoguessr, they used to constantly put me in small Brazil towns  and I used to always think it was Portugal"
We're 3 minutes away to maybe figure out they will need another hour
@RonInDune wow never heard of this game
https://geoguessr.com/
"I used to play it constantly, for hours and hours"
Most common misconceptions are: brazilians speak spanish. Our capital is buenos aires
And the entire country is a jungle
I would say thats top 3
"During Football world cup times, in my city there would be literal streetfights between Argentina and Brazilian supporters"
"just like people who are from texas drive huge trucks, own cattle, and ride horses"
Another hour
For a Bungie update
Honestly that Texas thing is spot on
i don't own a truck or cattle
Shame!
and i've only rode a horse once when i was much younger
@RonInDune yeah brazil vs argentina things get messy. We're neighboors that basically hate each other
"Yeah, if you're looking for a southern stereotype of riding horses and driving big trucks, come on down to Mississippi"
TO be fair I don't see a lot horses down where I am
But there's cattle farms everywhere and everyone owns a truck
my younger brother owns a truck and has owned cattle in the past
so both brothers combined you're fully Texan
It's like a Captain planet deal
i'm the tattoo having motorcycle riding degenerate of the family  😎
oh heck I didn't know you were *cool*
Thought you were a nerd
"i am a nerd, but i look cool"
Jealous
All I see is the unvaccinated kid
@Oathbreaker the main thing I don’t enjoy about PvP is having to be really good at it in order to get crucible weapons
*Not Forgotten intensifies*
"Okay, of the weapons, I'd say 2 are definitely some you should be looking to get, being Recluse and Mountaintop. Mountaintop can be farmed in kill lobbies, and Recluse is something that can be progressed slowly but surely.

The others I'd say (unless you're looking to get ritual weapons) aren't as ""needed"" these days. Eventually in the Crucible you can get better and will achieve those goals. Are the requirements for some really high? Yeah, the Luna's quest comes to mind with some steps. Same for the NF kills using Luna's in Survival. But at the same time, I don't think they should be participation medals so to speak. Definitely could be easier though"
"Still a valid opinion though, there's definitely some issues with how people can acquire them (even now)"
"And I mean, personally speaking, fighting NF at its peak against someone who had used the weapon for some ungodly amount of kills on players was extremely difficult. Against someone who hadn't spent the time getting good and getting to 5500 legit at that point was a night and day difference. Could still fight and challenge those players, but hey, that's how I feel about it"
"I think the komodo quest is decently balanced one, but the linear fusion kills are a bit much for a heavy archetype weapon"
Good example. Those could have been toned down a touch
"Like heroic glory is pretty easy to get to, and the kill count is doable with arbalest, but one kinetic exotic does not balance make"
"As much as I hated the mountaintop quest pre-adjustment, it did teach me to be really good with Fighting Lion"
"I don't know, I think the linear fusion kills were great for forcing us to appreciate Bungie's sound design of the *Arbalest* ~~demon weapon~~"
"The only quest I truly did not like was Randy's, but momentum control made that super easy"
Randy's was super grindy
"MT I don't have the necessary will to do it honestly. Maybe when I find a kill lobby, because legit never gonna happen"
"oh man I don't think I'd ever use a kill lobby, it feels like cheating"
It does
"Other day I quit a GoS run in a LFG because of cheating. On third encounter a guy got 10 motes, ran to the relay and somehow deposit all 30"
I was like wtf then I quit
Twitch prime loot apparently
*you had to be there*
"See if they gave out Anarchy, I would be 100% Team bungo"
Rofl
That would be terrible
Think of the amount of salt it would generate on reddit
WOuld be beautiful
https://tenor.com/view/salt-gif-10571320
As legitimately hilarious as it would be to see them add the various raid exotics to twitch prime I dunno how long it would be until someone firebombs bungle HQ
Bungie would be known as the Scourge of the Present
Bungie has not given an update yet. We can only assume their servers caught fire and the building has collapsed
yes that's the more plausible assumption
"I just imagine the social media intern is sitting in silence while staring at their phone. They know what they must do, but they can't bring themselves to open the floodgates of Twitter comments"
trying to fix the patch they managed to break internet and the power grid around bungo HQ
Deej does that right?
I'm not sure who runs the Bungie Help Twitter
and they caused an earthquake in cuba and jamaica
"Where's Bungie based in, Bellevue right?"
Anyone know if the city still exists?
First case of the coronavirus in the US has been found in Bungie HQ
I honestly dont understand why they didnt rollback in the first place and fix it internally. there is literally anything worthwile in the patch to keep game down as long as they did
"*You can't kill telesto
Telesto will live on
Combat Didge tried to kill telesto
But they failed, as they were smote to the ground
Healing Rift tried to kill the metal

"When they realised there is no way to get players stuff back because the intern forgot to backup the data before deploy the patch, they decided to set the building on fire"
I wonder why it'll take so long to rollback data?
Man their set up must be so complex I'm not even going to hazard a guess
@RonInDune i hope you enjoyed having all the lore for the brief period
Remember @RonInDune
"all your progression will be wiped, Im certain"
there goes my sword kills bounty dang
"I doubt it actually will take hours to rollback the data, but actually applying the fix and making sure it works"
yeah thats why they should have just rollback and fix the patch whenever they can
nobody would be pissed the bug fixes got delayed
but the game down for what 4hs now? that pisses people off
It's probably a server vs client issue
I'm having flashbacks to Shadowkeep's release
Played well for one hour then *dead*
luckily I wasnt around
I got the game for free in bnet months ago and didnt download it. then around last june/july I installed and played red war campaign
then never again until late october
I've been finding entertainment reading through all the armchair dev Twitter comments
"I mean, it's an online game with thousands of people playing. There's going to be issues like this sometimes because every account is another variable that get thrown in there. There's only so much they can do with test accounts without pushing stuff live."
*How could something go wrong? DONT YOU TEST IT?* ~ person with no I.T. experience
"maybe we can blame consoles, because I've seen rollbacks on steam for client side updates. but given the certification required for consoles maybe they cant do that"
"Wait, will silver-purchased items be wiped? If so, will silver be refunded?"
idk exactly how it works for console besides you send the patch and they need to approve it
I got the Phalanx shell and want my boi there when servers go live:katerinoSad:
Did you buy more silver for it?
Then I'm not sure.
"Like its going to be a rollback to before reset so you won't have the phalanx shell, almost guaranteed"
I'm not sure how they'll handle purchases tho
"relax you'll have your glimmer back, the ship and the silver we dont know lol"
I think it was the power of our datamine that broken everything
We got too much forbidden knowledge
"I mean, there's basic analytics that show when you made your purchase so it shouldn't be too much of an issue"
"Yeah should be very straight forward, I was just joking"
"I just hope they can refund the 80,000 silver I had before the servers went down:katerinoYikes:"
"Maybe the 50,000 bright dust as well"
Maybe the 100 prisms
Yeah would be nice for them to make sure my tarrabah and Ron’s anarchy are ok
I can only imagine that there's some poor soul out there who was about to complete his solo flawless PoH before the servers went down
Pour one out for the hypothetical person
is the game up now? or is it still down?
"down for a few more hours, according to their twitter"
"There will be an update to the situation in around 15 minutes, though"
the entire class when the professor tells us we're drinking a wine that's 20% alcohol
What kind of classes are you going to and where do I sign up?
"it's my wine appreciation class. each class we taste six wines, 3 whites and 3 reds. various varietals and vintages and all that good stuff and we pair with different foods each week as well."
it's so fun hahaha.
Can you bring your own glasses?
HAHAHA. but they're pre-prepped. but we drink a total of like 3-4 glasses of wine😂😂

Found that on reddit
Telesto breaks everything.
*Telesto will remember that*
*Telesto is learning. Telesto is evolving. Telesto is ANGRY*
*Telesto was right*
After the patch wish-ender will do x64 damage and telesto still gonna do telesto things
*We have decided to disable guns*
And melees
"""After much thought, we have disabled Destiny 2 until further notice. Wait for updates"""
Even if they disable all guns telesto still gonna break the game

I think Bungo has broken finishers
(I was using Telesto so not sure if that has something to do with it)
Lmaoooo
The answer is in your message
it's telesto
I'm not getting the finisher prompt at all
Not even the little circle marker?
alright i switched to Jötunn let's see if that fixes
nope no sign at all
🦀 FINISHERS ARE GONE 🦀
ok I'm getting it occasionally
🦀 FINSHERS AREN'T QUITE GONE 🦀
ok I think it's a Telesto glitch
Telesto strikes again lads
*Telesto will now upgrade you*
telesto powers everything.
It's kind of hard to see in these pics:
these fallen have next to no health and I can't finisher them
telesto back at it again.
wtf lmao
I even restarted the game
Telesto sends its regards Bungie
just its presence in the game is enough.
It demands *tribute*
*so that's why peoples materials went missing*
it's never satisfied.
"*Telesto was HONGRY, now Telesto ANGARY*"
Bungie has tried to kill it
It's becoming sentient
It *knows*
They can’t actually make D3
Because “Telesto when?” will follow them everywhere
It'll actually be Telesto 3
"And again, this time I had Telesto stowed"
telesto is actually the new taken king.
and when you take Telesto off as an equipped weapon and have something else in the slot it works yeah?
it claimed the throne.
Savathun is just a giant fucking telesto
when I had Jötunn on it was working
I don't understand what's happening lmao
We all know what’s happening
Go post it on reddit
no one really understands what's happening.
Telesto knows
Telesto understands
*oh god*
I couldn't do my finisher bounty lol I was so confused
I am a gigantic idiot
I had Heavy Finisher mod on
"I am very sorry for slandering you, Telesto"
let's hope that telesto accepts your apology.

my goal is to make telesto my most used pve weapon
the grave in CoT was for telesto
It's from one of the Prestige Levi raids right?
make it human
Should be prestige eater
I forgot what it does
its detroit become human all over again
I don't use telesto
always a good idea

A great thing about Telesto is it's lore foreshadowed Forsaken
Plus I love the concept of the Harbingers
Anyone willing to help Ron and I in a PoH run?
Damn id love to but I'm still in class and won't be home for a while
"@PC We're doing a quick PoH run, anyone want an easy pinnacle?"
i got the Aces catalyst
"yes, I did it! https://prnt.sc/quu8es"
Great! Now care to do it with a buddy?
that's awesome. good stuff man.
Give me a few and I'll run it with you
Thanks guys!
"@Thawxtem I can run tomorrow, no more PoH today"
Congrats @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 !! I knew you could do it!
"I spent my entire day on that dungeon, I just cant"
@RonInDune Thanks!
@RonInDune you still looking to do poh?
"I just got back on, if @Thawxtem is willing yeah"
How about it  @Thawxtem?
I'm in discord and ready in game
"gimme a sec, killing nightmares en masse for a quest for PoH item"
Maybe next project is solo shattered throne

good luck guys!!
do people want to set up a legend sundial run for Tuesday? @Destiny [PC]
I'm super down
I now have *all* the Taken mods except for Taken Armaments
So annoying
"Im missing those, I only have the hive ones"
"Do the free chests every week on all 3 characters, it's the easiest way"
Yeah I probably should do that
Wonder how comfortable the bastion hoodie is
Just saw the email
I’m buying it regardless. Lol
Where are free chests located? 👀
the what?
Does the Sunshot catalyst really need a 1000 explosion kills???
easy
sirens song
over and over
many thrall
Just like Polaris lance
"Shuro Chi checkpoint, 20 minutes max"
oh hmm
ok teh shuro chi thing thing seems easier
do you need Hunter tether?
That's where I did Izanagi and Hard light cata
It helps but isn’t needed since you want explosion kills
But for sure shaves some time off
perfect ty ty
I did it in the castelum
I did the Skyburner's Oath cata there
in the castelum
Shuro Chi is where I go when I save like 3-4 catalysts since you can use rally flags
So it makes heavy and special catalysts not terrible
Plus you can snack during death screens
oooh I do have the prospector cata half done for many days
thanks folks!
i just got 2 exotics from the nightfall ordeal
"veritys brow, and prometheus lens"
Uniques?
no clue
I like the community event thing that Bungie is doing
"The Mars one was cool, wish they'd fixed the resonant nodes"
That one fractaline farmer about to carry us
"I had two stacks of fractaline, just dipped below grinding for Jack King Queen 3"
Still have 9800
Jeez
Just did bounties
I’m only around 5.5k
oh god so many bounties
"yeah now that all my obeslisks are level 11, there's atleast nowhere to dump a bunch"
Once I had 5k and was just waiting for the sundial bosses I kinda peaced out for a bit
I thought about doing all the nightmare hunts time challenges but they're kinda sketchy
Feels way harder than doing the Dreaming City timed challenges
They aren’t that bad
"hmm, I just have Phogoth and Skolas"
"There are different strats, Crota was the worst of them"
"Phogoth was the easiest, even got flawless on that"
What's the Crota strat?
Crota I believe we ran two hunters with Orpheus rigs and a well warlock with Phoenix
"Hunters take turns on tethering adds while warlock keeps well up every wave they can, 21% delirium on knights and solar weapons for normal adds"
"Nice, will try that soon then"
Crota isn't this week right
"Clear room, bait Crota from the front and have the other person hit him from behind. He will one shot you otherwise"
"You can ignore most champions, the worst is the first room ogre"
Divinity and Izanagi honestly drops the Ogres pretty fast
Oh and every attempt go to the tribute hall for ammo
good point
If I manage to do this then I just need the solo/flawless PoH for Harbringer
I still need the ghost shell and ship haha
Ohhh I completely forgot about the bloody ship
"Also note it doesn’t have to be solo flawless, so you can find someone to help and play safe"
😮 new _emblem_
time to start playing again
It looks pretty cool too!
oooooh that is a cool emblem
i need it
Apparently if you have rank 10 for all the obelisks you get 4K a week in passive fractaline
"I have 4800 right now, but I haven't really been farming them."
that's pretty neat.
I think I'm at like 4800 as well.
@RonInDune about how many sundials do you think to get 5 more entries for Constellations?
8 ~ 10
"Also the nightmares this week are Ghaul, Phogoth, and Taniks"
hmm I might LFg for them then
holy crap that's crazy
What are the lore book under Letters from Eris and The Book of Unmaking?
how much does it tank to max an obelisk?
Highest rewards are at level 11 and it’s like 200 a level iirc?
so 2k to hit level 10 on an obelisk?
and then times 4 obelisks is 8k?
Could be 100 idk I capped them out like second week and haven’t touched them
and that gets you 4k a week?? that's crazy
"@Crizum That's the Pigeon and THe Phoneix, which is currently bugged according to Bungie"
Trissin it's 2200 to max each out
You want to get to Level 11 to get the final mod
so around 9k then?
@Crizum and are you missing any of these:
yup 8800
uh oh I only have like 2k right now
you get 800 fractaline from each weekly bounty per character
No Ron
Wait maybe for every rose a thorn
Plus 200 from Saint XIV per character
noooo I hate the weekly bounties so much
I can't grind them anymore
going back and forth in that area in the edz to kill 1 fallen captain
**20 times**
i cant
you can also buy 6 fractaline skimmers that maxes out your chance to randomly drop fractaline from doing any activity
yeah lol don't do those
The Saint XIV bounties are far easier and can be done in one Sundial run
do you get fractaline from doing the sundial?
or is it only if you upgrade one of the obelisks
Very little
Like 10-ish
I think there are Obelisk upgrades that increase the chance of fractaline dropping randomly from various sources
There must be an optimal order to upgrade the obelisks to get more fractaline
Datto had a video on that yeah
"Oh sweet, I'll definitely check that out then"
@Trissin wait until the Osiris mission on EDZ where you raise sagira is the daily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuZ6k7UxrSU
"Lots of loading screens but eh, nobody is gonna fight you for kills"
where I raise sagira?
That super fast CoO story mission
You mean the heroic story mission?
Are there lots of captains in that?
"I think it’s the second quest from curse of Osiris? The hidden temple in the edz, before you drop down there is a captain"
You can kill him and fling yourself off a cliff
Ohh I see
Not the most time efficient but you can also use a sniper to kill the dregs
Ty
So Bungo is working on a new IP
for what
"Noone knows, but people are speculating it's for a mobile game"
by bungie
this is bad
Remember NetEase gave them a couple of hundred million dollars recently
It may be “Matter”. They trademarked it a couple years back iirc
innnnteresting
obviously I trust Bungie unreservedly
They've never let me down
oh yeah confirmed:
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/famous-bellevue-game-devs-bungie-is-building-a-mmorpg-mobile-game-1
oh no.....
"know im going to get ads for that too, huh"

heh heh heh

"just a thought, how much power would a server room suck up?"
When I worked at Intel the server rooms were intense
A server in general or a server room for some specific
a server room for a supercomputer
"Cause it’s not only powering the servers, you have to power the a/c to prevent shit from overheating"
have a liqui nitrogen cooled supercomputer
not possible
......maybe
They usually have powerstaions custom built for redundant power delivery
i was thinking of mounting copious amounts of solar panels on/around the house
Not enough unless it's a small server
the sun is free
Yeah but you get sun cancer so solar isn’t safe
not where i live
"Solar is free, but not steady source"
thats why you have batteries
"but then again, that may not be sufficient"
small server rooms can draw a considerable amount of energy to maintain it's optimized state
NVIDIA Tesla V100 32GB Graphic Card
imagine mounting like 2 of these a chasis and a motherboard
i've worked with a 6 server set up and it drew and insane amount of power
need like 5 GPU brackets😂😂😂
i'd believe it
the cooling was stupidly strong
like we talkin -300 degrees strong?
piped in nitrogen through the racks to keep it at a stable operating
as low a -400 at times
maybe liquid hydrogen could be better....
dummy expensive tho
but it is the most affective
-400 degrees
setting up a single server is far easier
you can just use liquid cooling like in a pc
lol yeah I remember we wanted to test if we could fry an egg on the top of the rack
we even got the egg into the data centre then our eng lead found out
you can on an bare cpu after about 6 seconds
@LW Mugetsu  think we can continue Pit of Heresy?
i'm down for tomorrow
got work early tomorrow morning
"alright, sounds good"
wtf I'd never even heard of this game:
That's way more than Destiny makes right?
Dude fate is huuuuuuuuge
Lots of whales
but $4 billion???? That's bigger than CoD numbers
"Turns out, and not naming names @Trissin, but a lot of people love anime tiddies"
That's the direction Bungo should go then
Oh god please no
Give us the Shaxx/Drifter ero games we deserve

but I have friends who have literally spend thousands of dollars on fate GO

Thousands!!!
its a series
That's just addiction
very concerning
oh actually how is arknights @Saint 14's loyal follower
ive been getting ads for it _everywhere_
actually quite a good game
It feels like gambling at that point
@RonInDune it is gambling
it is literally gambling

"like, what the hell"
Report them damn
Bungie is taking that seriously now
@LW Mugetsu @Saint 14's loyal follower I can continue Pit sometime tomorrow after around 7ish CT

What's the next most efficient progress for the season pass other than bounties? I left the grinding until now and I have literally 70 levels to go. Need to figure out the best possible way to get this done lol
Bounties with guiding light are about it
Weeklies as well from ALL characters
Crucible and gambit prime give a good chunk of XP as well
I think comp and iron banner gives more XP than regular crucible
I'm at the same spot as you @Oathbreaker I think I'm like rank 27 or something
I'm considering just saying fuck it for this season really
"Sure, I kinda want the ornaments but like... I'm burnt out from having to hundreds of bounties in Shadowkeep. I don't really want to do it again lol"
yeah. personally I don't enjoy how much leveling the pass relies of bounty completion.
Bounties are the *worst*
I want Savior but I don't want to grind
"It has ended up being the only thing we do the whole season, just one bounty after another"
Its not like I'll actually equip the title
I don't feel like doing seasonal titles for the most part honestly
"unless it's something really cool, I just.... Meh."
"Enlightened is the only title I really want, because of how cool it sounds"
"I respect the people who do want it, but they just don't really scratch a particular itch for me"
Enlightened is a super cool one yeah
Like even Unbroken I don't really care for so much
"I've just been getting back into destiny after the start of the season, and I've just been kinda doing the weapons quests and stuff."
I've never super grinded for bounties
Unbroken/rivensbane/Shadow etc are actually a true test of skill
Not just showing how much time one has to grind
The thing for me with college and stuff is that I don't have enough time to really get XP efficiently from other activities if that makes sense
^^ I agree with that. I would put Enlightened in there as well.
So I have to rely on bounties to push me to rank 100
all the raid titles + Unbroken are the titles that show true skill honestly. the rest are just...look how much time you have to be able to play the game haha.
"The dawning bounties with double xp were good for that, you basically had to run around to various NPCs and give htem gifts"
Still hellishly boring though
Maybe if Crimson Days has x2 XP bounties I'll grind hard then to push me up there but I think I'm done for this season
I was away for most of the Dawning and was trying to not burn out on Destiny
yeah aside from the last sundial boss and empyrean foundation next week I won't be playing much until the next season aha.
Feels the same to me yeah
I'll probably do some Empyrean Foundation but like... other than that and finishing off Bastion I'd much rather just spend time doing other things
"DOOM 2016 has been fun, GTA Online is surprisingly entertaining, among other games"
that and being able to do IRL stuff
ooh yeah I really should finish Doom
IRL doesn't exist it's all a simulation
Ace Combat has been sooo much fun for me
And yeah the other thing is just school
Bonus points if anyone gets the movie
"So it’s still bounties, but if you can get a decent amount of fractaline for your obelisks they will create passive sources for the season, and you can use those both to donate to the empyrean foundation as well as complete weapon bounties which I believe give some exp. You can buy the items which make them drop at higher rates in crucibles/strikes/gambit/sundial as well as do some of saints bounties (which are usually kill 50 of X, get 20 precision kills on Y) if you really don’t care about the season no need to go for it, but if you only kinda care and want something that will give you the most exp for the least amount of work that sounds like the way to go @Oathbreaker @Trissin"
at this point I'm basically doing exotic quests for weapons I'm probably never gonna use it just for the sake of completion
I don't think there are any bad exotic weapon quests are there?
I’d still like to do a prestige leviathan to clear out the acrius ornament
Big same
i need leviathan for the acrius itself
I even did a prestige Levi with Trissin and co
i still dont have acrius catalyst :((
im definitely down to do prestige levi though!
This was like a million years ago damn
"its quest it's on the get leviathan ""things"" from leviathan bosses and encounters for ages"
wait why are there two Trissins
Is it your evil twin?
I probably switched characters
ah that's more possible
or it was my evil twin
Just imagine Trissin’s avatar with a little pencil mustache
today I was doing sleeper quest and omg it's annoying to collect the things that you need... I'm 9/15 rn
"I should eventually finish Hush, and the catalyst for Symmetry will suck even worse after this season"
super infuriating when you get a to a PE and some blueburry activates EP like 5s before the event starts
"Oh god, yeah I’m at 37/40 for those sleeper nodes and it’s been that way since before Forsaken"
@Crizum @RonInDune
I'm on 38/40 and I'm super mad
It’s all I have left for Mars and I’m pretty sure Ron will say the same thing lol
And lol Trissin
those last sleeper nodes take a while for sure
they were super frustrating
"Ive a bunch of stuff to do, you guys have a 2 years lead on me"
I spent 200-ish stems last time I tried and didn't get a single new one
I'm v v mad
Don’t burn yourself out haha
Honest @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 at your speed you'll be ahead of me in no time
"nah, it's gonna take a while"
Also @Trissin that looks like Snidely Whiplash
Does Littlepants and CnC no longer play?
https://prnt.sc/qvr686
LittlePants has been grinding tekken
and also league
So close to the perfect number
You can get to 69 420 I believe in you
"yeah, only need a swap lol"
@Jeremy
:izee:
the 69420
im past that now
you can never be reformed from such numbers
My ascension is nearing
The optimal number
So apparently Divinity + Xenophage/Actium War Rig is a legit damage option now for Raid level stuff
Sounds like I need to get Xenophage for that Xenophage-only Last Wish run
:thinkies:
You should get it! It's no longer quite as hard now that everyone is ~980
Oh interesting
Any idea _how_ good it is?
I like xenophage but haven't really found many good uses for it
It's about an 8/Xen
that one was kind of a stretch
Sorry. Been having a mental block when it comes to humor. Hopefully it's just a phage
I saw a reddit post showing the Xenophage combo did slightly more damage than Izanagi during GoS final boss
That is effective yeah
Probably because it's easier to hit as well
"Yeah, that makes sense"
Just gotta hope you get heavy between damage phases I guess
Heavy finisher/machine gun ammo finder/scavenger
But who would offer up super energy..
Run the Gos mode that gives heavy ammo drops when you're enlightened
Drops a brick every other kill
Ok that Xenophage post on reddit is a bit suspect. It does good damage but does not out dps Izanagi in a perfect  game
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ewonp1/the_xenophage_is_my_xenobabe/fg3dxb2/
So it's mor consistent it sounds like your sayin
"probably, yeah"
"@LW Mugetsu @Thawxtem I don't think I will be able to do PoH, I have some band stuff I need to go to"
:peped:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3ZGo3A5t6s
I'm not sure if that was a movie trailer or a fever dream
I seriously can't wait
It is going to be so nice
I'm looking for a team of people who want to go through the first encounter (minimum) of Prestige Spire of Stars 3x for the emote and/or Sleeper catalyst. Any takers?
"I’ve not done it before if that matters, but I’d be down to try. When were you thinking of going?"
"Ooh, prestige spire could be fun"
But it is actually really difficult
"I was going to first see if enough people were interested, then look at setting up a time."
What's the best modifier?
For SoS?
probably gladiator
ooh that one is good
"@Trissin that's why I looked it up, and found that only the first encounter drops these items I'm looking for."
Just melee a psion before doing damage
"yeah, you can even melee/shoot the pots to switch buffs too"
"...and I've only done regular spire like twice, so I would need a refresher/need to look up how to do it on prestige"
"Prestige SoS is the exact same mechanics, it just has a bunch of modifiers attached"
Plus the enemies are on level
"wait, can't you get the emote from normal spire?"
I'm pretty sure I got it from normal
I think you can
I've seen people get it
emote yes; just thought I'd do prestige to throw in Sleeper catalyst possibility
"If we want to just do regular, that's fine too"
I was thinking about seeing if people wanted to run a prestige levi today
But it depends on whether I can finish my homework lol
"well leave a spot for me, I'm free after dinner"
"Yeah let me know if you do want to run it, got no plans"
"also, anyone here do cosplay at all? I'm trying to make warlock boots that have the big toe singled out on the outside"
"whoa, that's cool!"
you gotta show us progress over time thawx
i'd love to see what it looks like
"I'm actually doing Osiris, already have a sketch pattern of his gold necklace nearly complete, and I've chosen what feathers I'm going to use"
I'm super excited to see it!!
Neckpiece design sketch
"It's double and triple infamy next btw, so store up your Gambit bounties if you want to quickly level up"
"Just realized, other than Dredgen title, we don't have any Gambit emotes"
:luxieSip: :luxieSip: :luxieSip:
It's cause goal doesn't like gambit prime
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1223019420789796864
It seems we'll get passively fractaline based on how high our obelisks levels are
"I just found the Shuro Chi wish, but for a minute I though I had found Wish 15 and felt incredibly good about myself"
"Your Tower Obelisk will generate Polarized Fractaline for you each week equivalent to its Resonance Power.
Increase its Resonance Power by upgrading other Obelisks - source: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48686"
Yeah Sar I saw people on reddit making charts for when is the best time to cash in on the rewards
I took a leap of faith and ditched all my 11k fractalines into obelisks
they're all lvl 25 now and resonance power is 10200
Think I’ll still just save my 5k and do the bare minimum for Savior
dont forget to pick it up weapon bounties before donate
each donation will be 100 and will boost 25% progression on each bounty that you have
so 400 donation all obelisk weapon bounty will be completed
"Contributing to the Empyrean Foundation costs 100 Polarized Fractaline.
Contributing generates a 25% flat progression for all Timelost weapon bounties in your inventory."
"Finally finished the sunshot catalyst, you were right @Crizum: it took barely 30 mins"
"Thinking about attempting the crucible catalysts, but man are those annoying to attempt"
Anyone know if Vigilance Wing is still any good?
It got buffed with the other Rapid-Fire pulses I think
hmmm might give it a go then
i still like vigilance wing
havent found the full auto to be very helpful though
Anyone down to do a Prestige Leviathan tonight or tomorrow?
Depends on the time but I’d like to try
I might be down tonight
^^post made. Time is flexible if needed
I may be a little later than that but I’ll let you know
Possible that I can join. Depends on how the rest of the day goes
"Are there any good modern horror-shooters out these days, in the vein of the F.E.A.R games?"
"Doom 2016 isn't scary at all, disappointingly"
"Well yeah, in Doom you are the scary monster"
But probably some indie games on steam
"lol yeah, rip and tear"
"I was thinking something more like Devil Daggers, which is indie I guess"
But those games usually don't have good shooting like the id games or monolith or bungie
You could find three friends and play GTFO maybe
What's that
oh ok that looks cool
but it feels like L4D ish
Kinda yeah
Most horror FPS games are light on the shooter aspect unfortunately
Yeah F.E.A.R. 3 was such a big disappointment on that end as well
"And with Dead Space gone, there isn't much action horror out there other than Resident Evil"
While not an FPS have you played the RE2 remake?
Nah I never really got into RE
I played RE4 quite a bit
Didn't think I actually ever finished the game it was so long and the QTEs were so annoying
No QTE’s in the remake
And it’s less action
"hmm I might try it then, all I know of the game are the Mr. X memes on twitter"
Yeah he’s fun
"You could also try re7, it’s first person and not too long"
Get Garrys mod and play the horror maps lol
Nover played Garry's mod either lol thought it was for kids
We should play clan gmod
that would be fun
Play some TTT or something
We can get our own prop hunt server
I ahveno idea about what people do in gmod sadly
You guys are speaking greek to me
TTT would be hilarious
ok I read up on TTT and it does sound hilarious
I think datto has some videos of ttt @RonInDune if youre interested
Ttt would be fun
Mr. Fruit has TTT videos on his channel.
GMod prop hunt would be fun af... I've played that with just one friend... and sometimes even solo. Still great
Never played TTT
@Peronix you. me. asmr stream. tomorrow night.
Woah now
we're getting to a whole new level here.
ASMR sports announcers
Which I guess is just golf
Cricket!
The 5 day version atleast
Man I love how cricket is both whiter and not whiter than baseball
lol Cricket is basically is an entire lifestyle
"When we would have India-Pakistan games, both countries would shut down"
That’s why Ikora went there
y e s
Aww you changed it
me english gud
Better than most
gonna change the entire vibe of twitch.
https://tenor.com/view/smiley-3d-vibe-check-creepy-gif-15669762
Ron why
I want Calus to reach for me like that
Peronix why
"It's the first gif when I searched for ""vibe check"""
it definitely checked my vibe that's for sure
Do it again with safe search off
*THATS NOT A VIBE CHECK*
*THATS A VIBE DEMENTOR*
What’s everyone’s patronus
uh I don't know?
never was magical as far as I know
"Here, I’ll pull up the buzzfeed quiz real quick"

Man I've forgotten so much about Harry Potter
Teenage me would be so disappointed
I read so many bad fanfics
My Immortal truly lives up to the name
*Stop. No*
Not that
I think I'm gonna be late for prestige levi later
If I'm not online by the time you guys group up in orbit then feel free free to replace me
"Also, I just thought about this"
@AhRealMonsters have you cleared normal Leviathan before? I didn't see any on your RR
:pepe: no
Because I don't think it'll let you enter prestige levi without normal completions
Aw 😦 okies
anyone knows if levi prestige also drops emperor seals for legend of acrius quest?
it's a step before the last one which is complete the raid on prestige
"but it seems the prestige run is only for an ornament, which i dont care tbh"
https://prnt.sc/qw9bgv
I believe they do
"^ 
I can't imagine why they wouldn't"
I hope so
I’ll be a tad late
dont worry
I just won a 1v5 in comp using a single nova warp super and handheld supernova
The super feels busted again
Also comp is going to give me a heart attack christ
@here still need a couple people for Prestige Levi if anyone's down
If you guys haven't started yet I'll be home in 5
although I think we'll still need 2 more
i dont mind if we dont do prestige levi
"I think @RonInDune may be down to do it? And yeah, if we can't get enough for Prestige, we can run Monsters in, if you're still down @AhRealMonsters"
I can do regular... that way in the future.. I can actually participate lol
yis lol
i can come along as well
as a fresh warm corpse and as moral suupport
I don't trust my internet so nick should join in
Do you want my spot ron?
thats happened to me so many times
keep forgetting to click back into the game lol
I'm grinding the suros regime catalyst
I gave up on grinding that
"I like the gun, wish it had more range though, so many times I get them to 5% health and they run away"
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HHV3LR2/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2L77EE7U53NWQ&th=1
...did the Raid derail again?
When I'm in the raid there are no rails
good enough
:challenge_accepted: This is @Peronix with the lean
@Destiny [PC]  Anyone want to do SoTP for anarchy today or soon?  The usual farming 3x boss?
Sure I'm willing to try today
I found a solution to my internet issues
@RonInDune oh you need it too?
"Damn, Im missing anarchy and tarrabah"
Anarchy for me lol
Im also missing some from quests but Im not in a hurry to complete them
Which ones are you missing?
We can team up and finish the quests easy
"Like lumina, malfeasance, chaperone"
"I think im at sleeper last step, the strike"
I need to check Im probably missing half dozen or so
"Yeah the final strikes for some of them are pretty difficult solo, especially Malf"
"Malfeasance Im at the beginning, the strike one. I loaded up, realized which strike it's and said f that lol"
"I'd be down for a 3x sotp for sure, I'm free pretty much all day"
Cool that's three of us maybe we can get 3 more
(Just tell people we have guaranteed exotics*)
(*Terms and Conditions Apply)
"I really want anarchy, I don't care as much for tarrabah"
"I like how Tarrabah shoots, but I've never found a place where its effective"
But usually you get what you dont care super easily like I got 1kv
Anarchy on the other hand is one of the best exotics in the game
"This week I farmed some 980NF using LFG and one was running anarchy, deleting champs"
Divinity+Catalyst Izanagi is what I end up using otherwise
Wonder if its any good in PvP
Good luck on the Anarchy guys
"Anarchy? Not really, you can do some fucking hilarious shit with it though"
"oooh, such as?"
Locking down a doorway when a super comes near for example
Or tripwiring two of your teammates and having them stand near a door
ok yeah I see shenanigans
Because it's activated when an enemy is *near* you can wait like 45 seconds sometimes
The issue with it is that it eats your exotic slot and you really have to predict the enemy
might be fun to mess around in mayhem
Honestly yeah
I know Cammy a while back used it to shut down a spectral blade super
I could do scourge today. I'm available any time after 8pm EST.
Literally drew a pentagram around a door in a hallway so not only did it cover the door it had some volume to it
Maybe finally our Anarchy curse will be lifted if we all draw pentagrams
@RonInDune can you create the lfg thing pls? I've no clue how it's done
@Kimarais/Nick lfg for scourge run is up
@Crizum https://clips.twitch.tv/FunColorfulAntelopeNerfBlueBlaster
*joins FBI watchlist*
*OwO what's this*
*notices jail time*
The logic is unassailable
One of yesterday's highlights followed by our dogs challenge completion
It was totally done not by accident
"Let's do the challenge? Nah, it's gonna be tough... *What? we got it!*"
"Don't worry, I got that boi clipped too https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulCrowdedSandpiperKippa"
That was funny
"wait, for izanagi's does it mean the watchers that are in the leviathan?"
the little robots
"Yeah, you can solo it"
but how?????
engine room is your friend
but its a raid?
or am i just stupid
So you only need to pick up the parts dropped from the watchers
yeah but how do you get there
You can open the underbelly at the entrance of the leviathan using the levers
which raid?
You can go directly into the underbelly without having to do castellum or any of the encounters
Leviathan Regular
thanks for the tip

It is a troll commercial too lol
How can anyone focus on sports when the child of Mr. Peanut has been birthed
"I was hoping to possibly get a fireteam together to finish off multiple strikes to finish quests for exotics (such as Arms Dealer for the bow, the one for thorn, etc)"

You can finish it in Shuro Chi in like 20 mins
Tether hunter is your friend
without a doubt
is it 500 kills?
if im remembering correctly?
You can get ~60 every run
I'm in orbit
lmk when everyone is on and i'll join up.
"in well, 1 min"
ill join on you in  sec

Why would you sell a a pin of a baby nut along with a “Looking like a snack” pin

This along with the #babynut Twitter hashtag is just a travesty
Crizum and Peronix tomorrow's spire runs HAVE BEEN CANCELLED
"Also, pls join us tonight for a 3x scourge run"
/\ lies
except for the scorge run
Did y’all not finish the 3x runs?
I’m down to join
We're at the boss with checkpoints
Boss is still unfortunately very alive
save us
our blessed meme savior and resident furry
grant us your presence and G I R T H
You guys just need the one person?
https://mobile.twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1PlKQmRNZnNKE @Peronix come stan babynut
I have *so* many questions. Who set the babynut up in the house? Why does babynut have a chair? Who watches babynut? Does babynut require baths in his nut shaped sink? Why did babynut naenae?
So much *L O R E*
based on the questions idk if I should click on that link
It’s just a not at all creepy live stream of the Jesus baby nut who has been reborn
It's so fucking weird
I still can’t believe they went with BABYNUT
#BABYNUT
"I don't know, it caught my attention. Put me through the 5 stages of grief in the span of seconds"
#CALUSNUT
He's the father
"If we go onboard the Leviathan RIGHT NOW, we can find his bedroom"
are we doing scourge checkpoints tonight or is that SoS run still happening?
I guess last night was decided to do scourge and not waste the checkpoints
8pm cst
alright. I can join if yall need someone.
"Cool, you should join. You were there from the start"
if someone else wants to try for anarchy tho they can take my spot. I'd just be there for moral support otherwise😂
wow we did a Herbie at practice today...we've been humbled 😂😂💀
"You know, SoS is only doing the first encounter, and could even be paused midway if we didn’t get 3x completed. SoS runs start an hour before you guys wanted to continue SotP, so it isn’t *canceled* per se"

"@Peronix @Kimarais/Nick 
https://clips.twitch.tv/SpeedyElegantRadicchioBuddhaBar"
"I’m sorry you had to find out like this, Kimarais"
You hate to see it
There’s an easy solution
Delete the titan
Hmmmmmm
memes aside that's a very cute cat right there
That’s a selfie of Crizum
We’ve all been bamboozled
btw do bows have no range falloff?
in crucible ranges
Think so since they are projectile
"I was getting full damage headshots across the map, though I was glitching"
what time were we gonna do the scourge checkpoint tonight?
Similar time as yesterday?
@Thawxtem spire not happening right?
Wrong
We have at least an hour
I thought we agreed yesterday in finish up sotp to not lose checkpoint
And I was always saying that the planned starting time was an hour before we wanted to continue SotP
The new GoS jacket changes are...something
"Doesn’t look *bad*, but I don’t know why they changed the green color it had"
Match the moon a little maybe?
"@Thawxtem if you end up doing it another time let me know, I don’t see enough people for the run"
I'm looking forward to getting the GoS jacket
"dunno how big you ordered yours, but my CoS seemed a little long at the sleeves from what I usually get"
I ordered my normal size
hope it fits you better than mine did
Finally finished the Suros catalyst
Honestly started enjoying the gun by the end
Now for Vigilance Wing and Jade Rabbit
i'm appalled that you did suros before jade rabbit
Utter madman
I don't like how the Jade Rabbit sounds
Dunno why
apparently if you have a lot of incomplete catalysts your new catalyst drop rate goes down
"(According to reddit, so might be completely wrong)"
"Yea, Jade Rabbit sounds pretty weird https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBF52C0NDX4"
"idk if that's true, I had several incomplete ones. did all of them one afternoon I was bored, didnt get any new drop after that"
I have like three unfinished crucible catalysts and still got the two in prestige Levi
"right now I've 3 incompletes, sturm, darci and the acrius from prestige levi"
"I have 8 incomplete, plus I somehow completed the Black Talon catalyst without ever equiping the gun"
18 completed
and I had like almost a dozen unfinished at some point
"Should farm those out someday, but darci is terrible to complete and I don’t think it gives too much of a boost right?"
"yeah, it increases stability but so many kills with heavy it's kinda annoying"
The Darci stability boost is actually quite significant
You don't need to get any DARCI kills to complete the catalyst
@RonInDune you got black talon by completing lord of wolves
Just have it equipped in crucible
hm i thought i needed darci kills
so i guess I can equip it and get some beloved kills
"In PvE yes, in PvP any sniper kills work"
Throw on heavy ammo finder and rip through adds in Leviathan Castellum
For DARCI
I'm pretty sure you body shot kill Legionaries with Darci so it's literally just a matter of one shot one kill
Need to find me the Sunshot Catalyst though honestly
"Yeah it's pretty fun now, the range is huge and I think the explosive rounds have no damage falloff"
I used it in comp to farm solar kills for Lunas
Yeah explosives and timed payload shots don't have damage falloff for a portion of damage
oh I need to finish sunshot catalyst too
"They split the damage into two parts, a guaranteed damage portion that is fixed damage no matter what, and the actual bullet, which can still experience falloff"
I've the kills but not the explosive kills
Wonder if explosive round trust would be better in comp then
"No, 180s really aren't a good choice for PvP"
lemme break out the spreadsheet lol
It comes down to mostly ttk issues
I'm like 20% on the solar kills and it's going excruciatingly slowly 😦
"So the issue really comes down to the TTK being a flat 1s at absolute best, you're really better off with even a 140 or 150"
"If you want a good solar hand cannon, use Ancient Gospel"
From GoS
ok yeah I have one
What's the roll?
Rapid hit/Dragonfly
Stability masterwork
hammerforged/tac mag
"Yeah that should be *okay*, I would recommend trying to roll something else but that's my preference on perks and such"
Alright I'm going to go in this weekend trying to finish the kills
can dragonfly kill btw?
"If you want other options, Adhortative, Outlast, Elatha FR4 with the right roll, Mindbenders, Last Man Standing, Omniscient Eye, Right Side of Wrong, Twilight Oath, or Beloved are all good legendary solar options"
"No, Dragonfly cannot kill unless the enemy is weakened"
"hmm I do have some good Beloveds, it's what I used to get Revoker"
"As for exotics, you could use LoW, Jotunn, Devil's Ruin, Eriana's, or Sunshot for secondary solar weapons"
"Jotunn works well in regular crucible, but in comp people dodge it super easy"
@RonInDune I need 5 to grab a smoke then I can join to finish sotp
"Are we starting now, thought it was in an hour"
I thought it was 8 CT
"Ron, I can give you some further tips on PvP if you want, this week is a little busy for me but I'd like to think that I at least *kinda* know what I'm doing"
So even if you record a pvp match and send me a video I can go through and review it and we can talk about things you could do differently or something new to consider
oh mybad i thought was est
Heck yeah that'd be great!
Thanks so much!
"I have an integral calculus test on Friday this week, so it'd probably be on Friday night"
kick calculus's arse!
just @ me when people are on for the scourge CPs i am just getting food.
Food?
"Im gonna get my anarchy tonight, I dont need food"
"And I've a backup plan, eat cheesecake and cry myself to sleep so it's all covered"
That's just a normal night
I'm in orbit when we are ready to go
kk I'm about to come in
"damn just joined a sundial, but its half way through"
ah guys i am gonna have to drop from the scourge runs. just feeling super exhausted from today so heading to bed early for once lol.
"it's all good, get some rest"
dont worry have a gn
whatre yall doin?
Scorge of the Past final boss 3x
can i get in on that?
There's a problem here
No one is streaming :pepe:
Hop in chat while muted?
"I can't :pepe:

It's locked to 6"
sad bois
I'm at work and like to watch people stream while here haha
Paid to watch people stream :pepefingers:
thawx went live
"Since it is full, I can't watch it 😦"
I would have to be in the VC in order to join
Thank you for trying though!
:cayde6:
oh no....
Spectacularly unsuccessful raid
what happened??
Noone got Anarchy
:dattoY:
The real Anarchy is the friendships we made along the way

then cry myself to sleep
let them eat cake

is everyone in this getting savior today?
I think I'm at like 4.8k fractaline lmao.
I didnt decide if I reinvest 10k fractaline I should get or get the title
Although useless would be cool an emblem with donated 50k fractaline lol
I mean idk...once I get to the 5k I need I'm basically fucking off for the rest of the season😂 doesn't seem like there's any point to stock up on it.
"Yeah but not like I've to actively do much, just buy more levels and wait a week"
knowing bungie you'll probably get like...2 fractaline back from the obelisk haha.
I guess worst possible scenario would be 1k back
If I get in 1:10 ratio
Still can obtain the 5k without doing anything but waiting
"I won't be getting savior tonight, still need to clean finish a few things."
we have to get the cowbell emote
all of us
Can anyone on tell me what the nightfalls are?
it's gonna be one I want to farm and I'm gonna be too busy to farm it lmao. Calling it now.
Lake of Shadows/Pyramidion/Festering Core
Thanks Ron!
Safe from farming this week at least lol
"what, you don't want a godroll Silicon Neuroma"
"or the best grenade launcher, The Militia's Birthright"
I have Mountaintop so no more GL shenanigans for me
"same here, sadly"
And Silicon is fun but Y1 perk pool and mod slots 😦
oh they didn't upgrade it?? lame
It would be a great thing for them to update the Y1 Nightfall exclusives to have random-ish rolls
"DFA, Silicon Neuroma, and Duty Bound are cool weapons but they're really hindered by not having Y2+ compatibility"
Agreed!
"DFA could be such a good 140 and if they buff 140s at any point it would be really good.
Silicon has some okay stats and a decent 72rpm zoom, so it too would be at least a decent competitor for your kinetic slot.
Duty Bound has alright-ish stats and with the right perk pool it could be so much better"
give them good perk pools Bungie pls
The new Sundial boss is *so much better* than the Undying Mind
is empyrean restoration this week?
Do I have to unlock it or something? I don't see it on the map
"Go to Saint, he'll have a quest"
I am talking to him right now
I don't think I have it
"I had to leave and rejoin the Tower, try that"
"okay, will do"
"Do you think I have to max out all the obelisks for it? Or complete a legend sundial run, perhaps?"
"also, random thing"
"got into a tower session with datto, raid: shadow legends, and ada-1's heavenly thighs"
The True Tribune
"Also, I noticed that he also doesn't have the bastion quest for me"
Did you do the story missions? The Corridors missions?
"oh, you know what"
i havent
Would it be possible to do another Sundial afterward?
i have to plant transponders
ty peronix
Agreed the boss is pretty freaking awesome
I would be disappointed that I can't play until our scheduled sundial but then I remember I'm wine tasting tonight so can't be upset.
"Oh no, you can only donate fractaline by 100s."
"So you need to donate 100 at a time, and it's a ""hold to donate"" thing"
"not a problem for me, i've only got 30 fractaline 😎"
Oh it's because you only need 400 fractaline to complete *all* the timelost weapon bounties you have in your inventory
So that's the new XP/weapon farm
It's sad that I read the _amazing_ in Lord Shaxx voice lol
lore lore lore
||https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48504||
This is pretty handy for those who don't have any fractaline to deposit:
Ron do you really only have 75k glimmer or is that from somewhere else.
I could eat the cost of that for a few ranks
I'm destorying my glimmer supplies to get a god roll jack king queen 3
can you buy as many as you want of that.
OH MY GOD WHAT
bc if so then I can get every obelisk to max level I think lmao.
I JUST DUMPED LIKE 2K FRACTALINE INTO OBELISKS
I never saw that: where?
It's after you finish the Empyrean restoration quest and talk to Osiris
"So I dumped the 5000 fractaline, but didn't get saviour"
Savior? More like Sav-you’re out of luck
Probably will be something in the coming weeks
"No, he’s supposed to have it. I got it"
:rip: :rip: :rip:
Go to orbit?
Oh wait no
I did...
"That triumph is coming later, yeah"
The triumph I got isn’t related
PERONIX WITH THE FAKE NEWS
@Peronix YOU SHINY DEGENERATE BIRD
lol it does give fractaline back at 1:1 https://prnt.sc/qxj641
The restoration isn't populating for me :pepe:
Lol is it a community effort title?
so people got hype to get Savior today only to find out it ain't it 😂
wait it literally is a community effort to get the title LMAOOO
"Maybe, we have no idea what the actual requirement is. I'd expect there to be a mission or something finishing up the storyline here in the next few weeks to lead into the next season"
How many weeks of the season are left?
from someone in another server.
There is no way they don’t adjust the amount needed for us
"The whole reason those higher levels are ?????? is so they can raise or lower, I’m not gonna save fractaline"
yeah  its smoke and mirrors to create engagement
yeah I don't think there's a reason to hold onto fractaline. donate your 5k for the community event emblem at the least.
but still...kinda dumb.
Bungie can’t actually hold the title back
idk...it's still time gated no doubt.
https://prnt.sc/qxjds7
maybe there's another step to the restoration quest that doesn't require community engagement ??
"Time gated sure, but they wouldn’t make the community requirements unobtainable"
"||There is mention of the tower obelisk picking up a signal from an unknown location, so maybe there will be a mission for that?||"
no that wouldn't happen.  it's just anticlimactic is all lmao.
"|| like you get the quest from saint, do 1 sundial run. next step is collect 30 orbs of light. then insert it into tower. talk to osiris again and quest ends ||"
"||I saw somewhere that there's supposed to be a quest from empyrean restoration called ""worthy"" or something||"
||it's a blue crown quest||
"||There's that leak of the final dialogue, so I'm 99% sure there will be a final quest||"
|| yes a time gated one. probably 1-2 weeks before season ends Bungo will say we did it!! then it will unlock the worthy quest ||
well...plenty of time to play ACO then lmao.
Leaked audio stuff ||Old man? The Speaker?||
|| maybe unlocks when you donate 5k but i doubt it. I donated 2k and got tired of holding MB so whatever ||
"||Probably the Speaker. Some say it's Rasputin, but I don't see why Osiris would call Rasputin a ""thug""|| @Crizum"

all obelisks are lvl 35 lol
So I think with weapon bounties @Trissin and @Oathbreaker can finish off the season pass for sure
yup I just got 5 levels in like 10 minutes
Why do you say that?
And you’ll be able to get your pick of Perfect Paradox or other weapons
Does donating give progress towards weapon bounties?
"Four donations completes a bounty, you can hold four at a time"
So for every 400 you donate you get four bounties done
"So what I'm hearing then is do all the fractaline, dump it into obelisks this week, claim, dump remaining into obelisks, repeat daily until next week, do the same thing, ad infinitum?"
"Invest al your fractaline in upgrading obelisks until the final week, get your returns, and on the last week spend time listening to a podcast and turning in fractaline"
Wait shit I can just buy the instant rank up things
Holy shit yeah that's huge
I still can't find them; Where are the instant rank ups?!
"Did you finish the quest so you can donate? If so, no clue"
btw the Crucible page has a new entry
I need to throw up.
Bungie:Please enjoy Trials!
"bungie: play crucible or we're gonna try and force you into it anyway

me:"
yall don't sleep on my disgust for it. I won't touch it😂😂
Flashbacks to Drifter's Wacky Adventures in Season 6
A whole season dedicated to fixing crucible might be *slightly* better than a whole season dying in Gambit and Reckoning
"Gambit isn’t bad, blueberries are"
And they had the nerve to add it when it's Infamy week
||***HEAVY TRIALS BREATHING***||
a whole season dedicated to fixing crucible sounds like Odyssey is suddenly my favorite game.
@Thawxtem after you talk to Osiris when you finish the quest you can purchase the Light-Fused Fractaline
Bungie please just give me a reason to play again. Give me an itch to consistently scratch with *something* that'll keep my attention
trials ? pvp ??
I’ll still go for the title if it doesn’t require flawless
see that's how I feel about a week or two into a new season when the PvE content is already fairly stale
if anything about next seasons title aside from needing the pvp ritual weapon requires pvp idc about it lmao.
"Oath, it’s about 10k per bounty, so 10 bounties will get you a season pass level"
"I will say, this past Season has been fairly alright in terms of content for a seasonal drop. I also really enjoyed PoH and GoS"
just praying the *entire* season doesn't revolve around pvp.
10k xp?
To speed it up I’d recommend being in a fire team for the extra exp you get
I mean hey.... if I can farm out a metric shitton of Jack Queen King 3s *and* get up to rank 100
I'd be fucking happy
Assuming you have the shards and Spider is feeling frisky on what he’s offering for glimmer
You can just buy a bunch of the exotic items that raise resonance
I got about 2k shards. Couple of metric tonnes of planetary mats too so I can be flexible about glimmer purchasing
"I’ll probably have a bunch of weapons just to hit +20 on the season pass level, because why not"
"70 levels of the season pass is something like.... what, 700 bounties? 10 bounties per level, with 70 levels?"
"Just about, you’ll have to account for not having all the xp boosters at the start"
"Each one requiring 10 fractaline, so I'd need something like.... a comfortable 10k to ensure I have enough to purchase all the bounties"
So this week I'd need to buy enough of the instant rank ups so I can really profit in the later weeks
What roll am I looking for on the jack queen king 3?
No exact perfect roll
lemme get the best of the best
I have a list of best in slot perks and good combinations
"Common ideal sights and magazines: Sureshot/Hi-cal, ricochet, ap rounds, light mag"
Sights are all fairly decent so any are okay
"column 1 perks that are good: demolitionist, subsistence. Almost all others are mediocre."
"Column 2 perks: Swashbuckler, Dragonfly, Rampage, Surrounded (VERY SITUATIONAL)"
"Supremacy is a confusing gamemode, htf is the scoring calculated"
"PvE wise: Ideally, you use it as a grenade machine with somethng like demolitionist and maybe surrounded or one of the other damage perks"
"1 point on kill, 1 point on crest pickup IIRC Ron"
PvP ||JuSt UsE sPaRe MiNdBeNdErS 4hEaD|| is more like demolitionist/swash for perks
hate the game
so many freaking mindbenders christ
it's what happens when it's the only shotgun that can roll quickdraw and is the hardest hitting archetype
also I wish a sword heavy attack would one shot an arcstrider
Sadly it's more efficient to use tractor
or any other heavy capable of shutting down a super
"I was using nova bomb purely as a shutdown super, anytime I see an arcstrider or whatever, kill em asap"
Reminder that you can run away from arcstriders because you run faster than them
I just try to float above
"Especially on Warlock, you have the straight line speed with bunny hopping to get away"
yeah seriously just run
I'll keep that in mind lol I mostly just blindly panic
"1000% of the time unless the arc staff is popped directly on you, you can escape"
"half the time in scrims when I was still doing them a few months ago, my team would literally just start running away. Immediately disengage from enemies and haul ass in the other direction"
lol ok that's actuallly pretty funny
https://tenor.com/view/wtf-runaway-johnny-depp-captain-jack-sparrow-gif-5206303
"if you know how to bunny hop on warlock ron, you have so much more straightline speed than that of an arc staff"
I'm super rusty with it but I can show you when i get a chance
"I think I can do it, but not reliably though"
Practice it
easier on some maps in comparison to others but knowing when to use it can save you a life in comp
Yeah I'll do that
This dude has 1332 kills on their not forgotten
rookie numbers
Annoying bugger
I've run into players with multiple thousands
"I dunno why I keep running into these guys, they're way better than me lol"
personal best was running into a guy with close to 20k back towards the tail end of Season of the Drifter
Because MM is all sorts of weird
That was pre-nerf NF too
"Honestly, sweaty fucking matches but was definitely fun to try and play against someone like that"
I suppose if you're good enough to fight back
"Yeah, when there's a big skill disparity it sucks"
also remember ron
kills /= skill
someone could have about 30k kills total but just play a *lot*
"agreed, but honestly if someone's good enough to get Not Forgotten then I assume they're pretty skilled"
"Unless you buy it, there's no shortcuts lol"
"I will say this much: legend doesn't take as much as it used to. Lot of people talking that it's easier in some aspects.

Besides, NF doesn't really have anything going for it. The one bonus it has is being able to body shot for the kill after 2 headshots. Otherwise, it takes your energy slot (something that spare doesn't) meaning you can't run a good quickdraw shotgun, or a good sniper. It has poor handling, and it doesn't even hit range cap IIRC. just barely falls short of 30m at 28 m. Still lethal with perk out to about 32m though."
"That being said, it does still take some skill (and a certain sense of masochism with the state of Luna's Howl) to get Not Forgotten"
Does it have good aim assist? that's what made spare feel so good to me
79 AA. That's slightly higher than average IIRC?
Lemme check in comparison to my other HCs
My spare has AA of 97
"beaten by Jack King Queen 3, death by Scorn and Hard Light"
Yeah so
there's a handful of HCs above NF's AA value
a hell of a lot more around or below it
Also I highly recommend icarus over targeting adjuster ron
but that's coming from a hunter so I'm airborne a *lot*
"icarus? I don't really fly and shoot, tend to sniped out of the air"
especially with the good scout rifles around
yeah then I mean.... TA is fine as a mod if you stay grounded more often than not
Yeah airborne for Hunters means something completely different than it does for Titans and Warlocks haha
That vertical leap is nuts
I mean I just only use icarus lol
even on Titan and Warlock
I like to use my vertical space
takeaway from Titanfall I guess
"Yeah, hmm, could probably spec for it and use lion rampants"
Dunemarchers
Or OEM
And they did give twilight garrison to warlocks
But that still makes me feel disgusting wearing it
Twilight Garrison on hunter?
I meant warlock lol
Ooooooooh
I was gonna say
the fuck did I miss
what exotic am I hunting now
Naw the day they give hunters air dodge is the day they give up
that would be too much mobility honestly

Mother of god
should i try 720p/60fps or 1080p/30fps for my stream tonight
Why not 900/60
That's what I do. Good compromise between quality and performance
streamlabs doesn't have 900 for me.
Click on it and type in 1600x900
alright. we'll see how that goes aha.
Is the run in 20 minutes or an hour and 20?
"like, i've been at 720 this whole time and upped my bitrate so it's been fine."
hour and 20.

Feels gooood
oh my god ron you are grinding through these catalysts
and i am so disappointed that you chose to do jade rabbit last
I have Jade Rabbit left but I think I'll wait for momentum control lol
thats disgusting
ewwww
i just saw the energy weapon
this is just as bad actually lol
"yeah, nevermind"
sword??
im a god
at least with a sword
its broken
in every gamemode
I feel so bad when I round the corner with a sword and swipe through people
and no one expects it
||That's why there was a sword on your grave||
@Oathbreaker  loves swords in crucible so I'm sure he'll be very happy to see that
shut up thawx
||maybe its really caydes grave||
Also @Trissin it's funny how similar our heavy PvP weapons are
oh wow you're right
Like 4 of the same guns
but no sword.... 😦
nearly in the same order too lol
"I ran a sword today the whole day while grinding catalysts, got 2 kills"
"y'know, its not as much as swords suck, its the fact that getting the heavy ammo is nearly impossible"
and id rather use that ammo on a friggin rocket launcher
imagine a heavy only game mode
"oh wait, that already exists
it's called gambit"
but its not pvp
its pvevp
It's PvP if you really want it to be
everything is pvp if you want it to be
"Ignore everything, wait for invasions"
"but then its not gambit, its crucible with taken"
Can you imagine if Shaxx accidentally lets some taken into a crucible game
thatd......be fun?
but imagine the lore twist
doesnt shaxx hate Drifter?
If anywhere it should probably be in the Dreaming City map
"I think the drifter is the only one who can really ""let"" some taken anywhere"
He works with him reluctantly
"hold up, was D1 story tied into D2's?"
Sorta not really?
"Forsaken was, very thoroughly"
There was a strike in D1 where a signal went out to the red legion and that lead to D2
Strikes in D1 seemed more involved in the main story

ron
are you trying to make me have a heart attack
"you know you love it, deep in your heart"
"I know I hate them, deep in my heart, yes"
THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL
especially black talon
Black Talon is the only acceptable sword
It's a pocket Dawnblade
they should have a sword that takes secondary ammo
Something similar happened before. They added shotguns in different slots. look where we are now.
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 What is the max level for the obelisks?
i mean they have grenade launchers that use primary ammo
"A single one, yeah"
why not have a sword that uses secondary ammo
Taking an exotic slot to use primary ammo
its still a grenade launcher regardless
splash damage is a big advantage
in any scenario
"i mean, they also have a linear fusion rifle that uses secondary ammo sooo...."
excuse you oath there are two
Primary ammo GLs?
Or acceptable swords?
primary ammo gls
whats the other one
fighting lion and what?
What's the other one?
yeee
i thought you were talking about kinetic
Yeah it's just Fighting Lion
Ohhhh lol
mbmb
Yeah no I'm talking primary ammo
wasn't there a gambit one?
"alright, I'm considering combining two things I hate the most for an okay reward: I'm looking to get Hush when I have a chance. Anyone have any tips for bows and any other specifics towards the quest?"
"For me, either Le Monarque or No Turning back worked excellently to get lots of headshots"
Plus I did most of it in regular gambit to get lots of easy medals
"Yep, Monaraque is wonderful"
I'd also snag a gambit useful weapon in your kinetic to make life easier.

but also this is twitter&reddit so
not exactly reliable
Trissin I was gonna ree when you pinged me but then I saw what you pinged me for
So thank you
So does the weapon type stay bad or does a small part of the player base get to do zoomies
It'll be a good way of lessening the amount of fractaline I need for the r100 grind
we have literally no idea how it's goin to affect speedruns at this point because we have no idea how it'll work
Sounds like swords will be nicer to use in general play though

"ohhhhh, replaces your melee"
btw how hard is heroic menagerie now?
want to do it tho
i need more SWORDS
yeah I want the warlock/hunter sword
"I think it's pretty easy, the main challenge used to be the 780 enemies I'm pretty sure"
But also I haven't done it recently
"So this weekend, let's do both 3x Scourge and a Heroic menagerie, if we have people"
LEMMEE INNNNN
"Ok everyone who wants to do either, raise your hands"
:pepeD:
"Heroic menagerie is doable with 3 ppl, but it's kind of rough on certain encounters"
It would be easy to run after the raid tho
hey sam's back
"Also, if anyone doesn't have the Izanagi catalyst, it drops from the chest"
If you have a perfected chalice
"I need the Izanagi catalyst, so I'm down for a heroic run"
"As @Infernosi said, make sure your chalice is upgraded"
"Yep, it's all good to go. Been trying to find an LFG for it with no luck 😦"
"so, is someone going to make an lfg post?"
So when is everyone free
Tomorrow 8 CST for 3x Scourge?
*guaranteed*
@Destiny [PC] Scourge Run tomorrow night
@RonInDune want to do the NF around 7pm then?
anyone else is interested in 980NF with me and Ron?
NF?
"Cool, tomorrow 7pm CST @Peronix"
@Saint 14's loyal follower nightfall the ordeal
get that sweet ascendant shard
@Peronix check out the PC LFG discord. It's huge and that's where I do all my D2 lfg
Just be aware there is a massive variety of players on there
I did all 3 of this weeks Master nightmare hunts on the PC LFG
Got the TIme Trials too
"nice, I need several trials"
Honestly with Divinity/Izanagi it's a joke
I did only the easiest one this week the gatelord but I did solo
"yeah nightmare hunts are kinda easy, only a couple of them are more annoying"
"on top of my head the hardest ones are the witch, one that you need to hit it with a sword and the one that teleports everywhere"
like a fallen captain
holy moly
the PC LFG discord is massive
It's one of the largest Discord in the world
it goes down on a daily basis lmao
Yeah it's pretty crazy
You might run into some semi famous players on there too
Like Trissin
Pls
you know i'm right
I'm not famous
Or did you mean I've run into famous players before
@Trissin you will always be famous
"But also be careful for some, less desirable players on there"
You forget that we 2 man'd some raids Trissin
id bet
you're gonna be famous to me 🙂
"oathbreaker, are you secretly lord shaxx?"
"Same, you two are legends round these parts"
I wish I was Shaxx incarnate
I used to be so much better than I am now when it comes to PvP
"and trissin is just osiris, but instead of being able to bend time, he just time travels to the newest anime release"
taaaadaaa
i don't think my meds are on
the graphic setting on life are too high
@Oathbreaker I'll gladly practice with you if you'd like. I'll take what practice I can get for the tournament coming up.
"Haven't been playing much, been taking college more seriously. Would be okay with it when I have time, but next few weeks are busy for me. When's the tourney?"
28th 29th
I can definitely be around more when it comes to sometime around the 14th
"It(and my partner) are on PS4, but I don't have as much time to practice there compared to on PC."
Sounds great.
Is it TV's tourney?
ah okay cool. I'll make sure I'm adhering to those rules if we do any 1v1s or whatever to give you a better idea of what you're gonna be up against
I'll be running Last Word snipe with Ophidians and Nova Warp
And blink
Good choices
It's been my baby for close to a year now I thinkk
i have to go back into the corridors again??? :((
Do you? Why?
corridors of time part 2
follwo the broadcast or something
Part of the story quests
My liver is working out so you’ll have to be patient with me
So I may have just spent the last hour planning out gear setups
Excel is a godsend
but I have my armor planned out to a T
"all of this gear I have access to right now, just not all the mods or the mats to make the gear that way"
.....I wanted something to do other than study for my integral calc exam tomorrow morning
Nice work!
Calc is also pretty fun though
honestly integral is oddly entertaining
Wish my students spent this much effort on their homework
it's completely ass backwards to what I remember
but I almost prefer it over differential
Honestly IRL you'll be integrating over curves far more anyway
I've had an interveiw pop up pretty early tomorrow so I'm gunna have to bail on the raid this evening. Really sorry guys!
it's fine
good luck on the interview!
Thanks mate!
"depending on the status of our game tonight, I could be available as another alt for the scourge runs."
I cant wait to get my sparrow stuck and die miserably lol
What the fuck
:Birdronix: :Birdronix: :Birdronix: :Birdronix:
Inifinite Dawnblade super by just switiching weapons
https://twitter.com/GladdOnTwitch/status/1225913375164551168
WOnder if I can cheese comp with this
dmg’s response is great
"Ron, don't use that as a way of going through comp"
Also that will help you for like a round? And get you reported like mad
"oh man I was kidding, I hate cheating in PvP"
oh my bad then lol
Be honest though if this wasn’t found until trials came back you know people would run this
I didn't even use Lord of Wolves when it was broken lol
jesus lol: https://clips.twitch.tv/PlayfulStupidKittenStinkyCheese
btw @Crizum I'm watching Datto play GTFO and I just realized  it's 4 player only
Also it's super intense
@RonInDune @Peronix are you guys ready?
oh man I'm not even home yet I'm so sorry
If anyone else wants to run a 980 NF got for it
np dont worry
"I apologize, but can we start 20-ish mins later? I didn't trust google maps and am paying the price in traffic right now"
did you hear about the guy who created his own traffic jam on google maps?
Yea using a cartful of phones
Clever dude
"i read that, and cracked up"
"@RonInDune we can do after the raid if we don't take too long to finish it, or maybe tomorrow"
we putting the raid on ?
Raid in 15 mins
Ron wants his anarchy
"what do you think would sound better in a synthwave/chillwave track, a stabby analog synth or a more floaty pad-like synth?"
floaty
floaty pad-like
"I shall get my Anarchy 1st run, so Ron can have his on the 2nd"
stabby analog makes me think of like perturbator and carpenter brut
I better get Anarchy tonight or so help me god I will turn this car around and go straight home
DONT TEXT AND DRIVE
I am technically in a parkway
driveway
I'm coming online now
@Saint 14's loyal follower hey man you good
you got kicked
for inactivity
"@Destiny [PC] If IWant doesn't come back, is anyone free to do 3x Scourge?"
We can guarantee a particular weapon drop
"my power went out, its back on"
I'm coming. back
55 mile an hour winds and rain
power went out again
I just turned my pc back on
Will be back soon

the destiny gods make me *ANGERY*
No anarchy is pissing me off
Wanna borrow mine?
I think I'm the only person who legit doesn't care that I haven't gotten it lmao.
I want just because the sake of completion
You should want it because of how good it is
And how much fun it is
Yeah I know it's good but I'm probably not gonna use it that often
Also what I thought until I used it for the first time
The only time I have used it is for the raid where it splits the area into 3s with the fake versions
Crown of Sorrow
Yeah I know you can bug CoS boss to extend damage phase
"Yis, it was my first time running that so they told me to bring it haha"
But haven't used it since
Did you get anarchy on your 1st scourge?????
yes lol
Holy
"Trissin, remember the death tower from our runs lmao"
I got 1kv in my first try lmao
Literally killed all 3 waves in 20 seconds
"""Spawn camping"""
Somewhere on the DarknessTheGame forums some poor acolytes are raging about OP enemies that kill them as soon as they spawn in
"I killed riven 3 times, did the run and got it. I remembered Goalie said how hard it was to get the drop"
you either got 1kv on your first run or it took you so long that you were unable to both play and enjoy new content until you got it.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1150080/Azur_Lane_Crosswave/
they bringing this shit to PC??!!!!!
Fuck boats? Yeah
wtaf
Ron first lesson of anime
bruh its only the best game
"Everything is a waifu, and waifus are everything"
even boats
from wwII
@Trissin this is known correct?
i hope he knows
Oh Trissin knows
He knows *all*
I have been summoned
scroll up
Ron needs a waifu 101 course
Intro to Waifuisim if you will
we must teach him
Azur Lane is p good
i spent 3 months stuck in that stuff
i prefer gfl tho
"For homework I want you to go to google and type in a random thing that comes to your head, it could be anything!"
use rule 34
Search again with the word “anime” in it
now I'm worried
anime tanks
"imagine, war thunder but its a waifu game"
id play that
"It could be something as simple as an animal, to something like a geographical location (looking at you Area 51-Chan!)"
EARTH-CHAN
IS NOT FLAT
Remember when we took the first picture of a black hole?
*the eyes*
"hol up, is she eating mars?"
not Rasputin...
"Her favorite dish, Raspoutine"
why does she not have a nose
@Peronix that joke was uncalled for
So many waifus to teach  @RonInDune about.
A couple of years ago we had CPU waifus.
Then we also have dino girl waifus.
Just to name a few
Professor Mugetsu about to grant you guys a doctorate course
"There was a style transfer paper recently that could convert a real photo into any particular chosen style, including anime"
I have a crazy amount of anime knowledge I could drop on y'all.
"We were using it to auto generate juggalo makeup to defeat facial recognition, but the anime face part got a lot more attention"
Results were fairly horrific tho
Yeah those are pretty disturbing
https://www.gwern.net/Faces
dino girl is best girl don't @ me
When she smiles it is pretty amazing
https://media.tenor.com/images/4632e943653b0ad278a1fa7b8f49d82c/tenor.gif
Yep that's the one
Catgirl waifu.
I might Sherpa some friends through last wish tonight and we have 2 spots open
Just if anybody is interested
some people like Bowser waifu.
I'm so close i can taste it
go get it
@RonInDune want to do that NF tonight?
"sure, in like an hour?"
i feel amazing now
congrats!!
@RonInDune sure
thanks guys
it's a great gun
ok so I went through my Totally Above The Board Movie Collection ™️ and found anime movies
I'm gonna watch them and be enlightened
which anime movies
I think they're on Netflix too
oooh evangelion
Never watched it
old school
have you seen kimi no na wa?
your name
for anybody who hasn't seen it i would recommend it
"I may have, is it one of those Ghibli movies?"
i don't believe it's ghibli
I saw a lot of those in college like 10 years ago
you should watch it!
I'll try to get it! ty for the rec!
i would probably say it's been my favourite movie since it came out
does anyone want to join me and Ron for a 980NF in 15-ish minutes?
I may be able to
"cool, I'm about to launch the game and move gear around"
I'll be on in 10
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83Kij6AJUaQ
just watch the intro
this editing blew my mind
Just got a deep ass message on PSN from a random account
about?
"“Be in the world, not of the world. Kind of like lucky charms”"
thats deep as hell....
Such a spiritual phishing attempt
“The marshmallows flow with the cereal but they are not the cereal”
...what waifu madness did I miss?
all of it
we enlightened Ron
on what waifus are
Ultimate display of Evangelion fandom: life size EVA 01
whoa!!
where is that???
in china i think?
look at how big it is!!!
Found it when googling pictures of two life size waifu statues I know of: Rem and smaller Dragon Maid girl
02?
rem is best waifu
"You mean Rin, right?"
REM
YES
MOAR
FEED MEEEE
Everyone has their own favorite waifu
shit whats her name
she's like 999 years old
Kanna
can't forget about Rory.
Because that’s porn
no porn
As prince Uldren once said
Can't believe no one has brought up the *actual* best waifu
NOOOOOOO
MY EYES
“The line between Ecchi and Hentai is so very *thin*”
Get out of here with that @Peronix
WYM THEY THE SAME THING
Who are you to judge my anime tastes
thas not anime
"“Can you claim to not be a Baka, Guardian?”"
"_""It's not that I want you to help ignite our forges or anything...**BAKA!**_"
its beautiful
what in the fuck is going on here
It works so well
We’re discussing Destiny
https://youtube.com/watch?v=reXe5cpvMy0
Everyone knows Destiny is an anime at heart
We don't know what you are talking about
bro that vid is so surreal
Eris is waifu
"Oath shows up, entire room:"
@Peronix what is that?
what hunters should look like
oh god what is happening here
"I've no idea, just found it randomly"
I've summoned pandemonium
anime is happening
can we get an anime chat?
At this point @thegoaliebear should make a quarantine channel for anime and shitposts
"The destiny-pc-lfg chat has just become anime, memes, and the occasional lfg post"
@Crizum they have constructed a quarantine place near where i live for the coronavirus
#animemes-maybe-nsfw bois
lfa - look for anime chat
Wonder if the ps4 or xbox people are gonna stumble on that nuclear wasteland of weebery and be confused
It took exactly 6 minutes before the channel became a haven for suggestive pictures of anime characters. I'm so proud
You *sinners*
Need one more for a sherpa run of last wish starting in about 10 mins
Anyone interested?
no exp or any thing necessary
"I can if need be, but I got some time constraints"
No worries then
Can always LFG
"if you need one just let me know, I'll log in"
"Well it is a sherpa run, so it will likely take much longer than usual"
If you have time constraints it might not be a good idea
yeah that's what I'm thinking right now
it's not like super bad time constraints but like.. I got work in 12 hours or so
well it is up to you
That leaves you with 6 hours :pepefingers:
Have you done LW before monsters?
No :PepeShrimp:
But I am at work right meow 😦
Ya boi gets paid to be on discord lol
Yeah get to watch these :pepefingers:
"now that i'm thinking about it, i dont know if we'll be able to kill riven"
i still need to watch today
as it stands I work 3 departments for a hardware store because I can actually do my job
"all at once during a shift, I might add 🙂"
I used to work for HEB in produce
real fucking fun running around like a madman
"and since I knew other departments, I would get dragged into them :pepe:"
I don't miss those days
"Well, just the produce area"
Working on getting a co-op position soon though so I'll be fucking *gone* from retail lol
🤞
"In full transparency, I work for Hulu lol"
Anyways for last wish i really don't mind finding a random for LFG
So that is why I have time to do this stuff
I don't want to take up too much of your time oath
yeah I'm gonna dip out for this run Trissin
haha of course
I gotta say though I'm still down for us trying to low man stuff
no need to apologize or anything
yes!!! me too
I think we could do gahlran
"I'd be down for Gahlran, just a matter of when I can be around and needing to get the mods because what's pve"
just took a quiz on champagne. tough work this semester.
They should give you bottles of champagne to celebrate
we do drink a $300 bottle this semester so. they didn't leave us hanging with that.

"What's a good crucible rapid fire shotgun? After using all of the frames, that's the only the frame I'm comfortable with"
Threat Level/Ikolos  is just not giving me consistent results in PvP
for rapid fire i usually run wishbringer
it feels pretty good with a decent pvp roll
hmm I do have a slideshot/opening shot wishbringer
I'll try that out ty ty
Datalattice for shards and glimmer for datalattice
Get you some resonance

anyone down to do heroic menagerie?
I would be down to do it in 2-3hs
I can make a post
What boss is this week? I think I need the lore piece in the giant Minotaur fight
If someone needs the catalyst or clear I wouldn’t take the spot though

Short version is the guardian that created Thorn
SPPOKY MAN WITH COOL GUN
guy who made Thorn
oops caps
was a famous Iron Lord that got corrupted on the moon
byf has a great video on him
sad story
Thought he wasn't an Iron Lord?
Yeah i thought he was way after the iron lords
He was Risen right
oh yeah he wasn't an Iron Lord my bad
There's a fantastic illustration of him in the Grimoire Vol 1
i was going to say
I googled him
and he looks badass
||Of course the Titan loses to the Golden Gun though||
"lol, I think he wanted to die though"
funny thing is he killed Jaren ward of the 4th of July
"damn, now that o think about it"
Destiny 2 lore goes way deeper then i thought
like holy shit
"so it does, Bungie always goes all in"
The grimoire has a lot of the really cool shit
I'm waiting for my copy of vol 1 and 2
The problem is none of it is really explored in game
The Grimoires are *fantastic*
You play the game and you get “Who the fuck is Ana Bray and why do I care?” “Just who does Zavala think he is?” “Why should I give a fuck about Osiris?”
Oh and
Yeah especially Ana is supposed to be one of the most powerful Hunters in history
"“Wow Xol is a total fucking joke, this is a god?”"
"speaking of Xol, who are the other worm gods"
"Ana ""my golden literally makes wells charged with light"" bray"
Did you read the new piece of lore about how Osiris basically controlled the whole city during the battle of five fronts
"Eir, Akka, Ur? Right Ron?"
He was *badass*
"Akka, Eir, Ur, Xol, Yul"
"Yul, Eir, Xol, Ur and Akka"
"There was a lot of lore around the Taken King, I think Akka is “dead” right?"
Yeah Oryx consumed him to get the power to Take
"Akka is what Oryx used to form the Dreadnought iirc, used his body to make it"
holy shit guys my head hurts reading about the lore....
back to our regularly scheduled conent
"The story of Aurash, Xi Ro and Sathona is so cool"
Someone should write a proper novel about the 3 sisters
"wait, so lemme get this straight each of the ""factions"" has therE own kind of unique background/story?"
yup and Future War Cult is the **best**
I'm impartial to the factions honestly
btw wonder what Bungo is going to fix
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1226670564535758852
THEY WILL BE DISABLING HuNTERS AND REMOVING TELESTO ENTIRELY
whoa caps
Probably the warlock super glitch
they need to buff dawnblade
I hope they fix the loading into tower
that stuff blows
"if they try to remove telesto, telesto shutdown all servers and deletes all data but its own"
"Dead Orbit is too fanatical, but I agree that Earth is a beacon that risks Humanity as a whole, FWC I believe wants to only focus on eternal preparations for a war, which is all fine and dandy but they rely on a machine to predict the future by breaking people's minds iirc. New Monarchy just wants to be dictators basically lol."
i wonder if bungie will evr make a true open world destiny
"The Dead Orbit fleet will come in handy someday, so they have some value"
New Monarchy are just bad
"Space Goths, Space Fascists, and Space ‘MURICA"
"I wouldn't say they are bad, I just thing NM is just too tied down to the Last City and Earth as a whole"
"*If* FWC is right then trying to bunker down *or* run against this oncoming conflict will ensure that humanity loses. Asymmetrical warfare may be the only method of survival. FWC probably has the best grasp of that. DO is just gonna find somewhere else to call home, NM is just gonna try to turtle and weather the storm. Neither are possible."
Yea FWC are the only feasible option that lets us fight by using the guardian paracausal nature to the fullest
If we plan on doing heroic menagerie I woul love to join in
speaking of it
"For sure, in like 30 mins ish?"
1/12?
12 people...
Menagerie isn't coded into the bot so it justs defaults to 12
it's 6 as usual
12 man menagerie sounds hilarious
thatd be utter chaos
"I'm gonna have to bail, I'm super tired from last night"
@Crizum if you want join menagerie you can take my spot
I remember a bug that existed for a very short period of time back in the Division 1 that let you invite more than the group cap of 4 into a mission
division
what a good game
People would group as 20 and stomp the hardest difficulty at the time
was golden
"Put myself as an alt, would need two others. @Peronix did you get your heroic clear?"
"Unfortunately, no. I'm about to hop off the computer, though, so I won't be able to participate tonight"
@Destiny [PC] Anyone down to do a heroic menagerie run in a few minutes?
We have 4
we need 2 moar
You aren’t loadout locked in heroic are you?
we in boys
Me and Jeremy can come
i'm a feeling a bit

*deep lore*
Love the Bioshock reference
"""Would you kindly"" is pretty similar to ""O Guardian Mine"""
oooh they're rebooting Anthem
https://blog.bioware.com/2020/02/10/anthem-update-february-10/
Anthem: the Runback
If they can pull off a No Man's Sky or a FFXIV I'll be truly impressed
"maybe if they never branded the game as the ""Destiny killer"" they wouldn't have run into all the shit that they did lol."
Neither The Division 2 nor Anthem quite  came up to Destiny's level anyway
they hyped themselves up for something they were never ready to take on.
I low key want to get the division 2. but I know I'd barely have the time to play it between my other games lol.
"maybe if it's on sale at some point for like, ridonkulous cheap."
"I liked the snowy New York setting of The Division 1, but the setting of TD2 just seemed so boring"
the customization aspect of td2 seemed decent enough to get my interest. but it's definitely not a game I'm just gonna buy lol. definitely will wait for sales.
Division 1 did have a great atmosphere. Just wish it was more mechanically sound
"I wish we had a new Crysis, set within a fully realized city like The Division"
That would actually be sick lol
I know Crysis 3 was a flop but I really liked that one too
"Anthem was like, speed run Destiny"
"An acclaimed studio that made some of the best games of previous generations releasing a live service game, but Destiny was first and wasn’t tied to Frostbite so it had more time before people started to get upset with the lack of content"
"Also most of the ""Bioware"" that made anthem in a shell of the team that gave us mass effect"
yea that's the saddest part
I'm not even sure how good the next Dragon Age is going to be
Haven’t played The Division but is it the boring ass Ubi open world paint by numbers but with other people playing with you wait that’s ghost recon
"Kind of, but the world is prettier and the environmental storytelling is top notch"
And the city itself is incredibly well realized
Though I've never been to New York so I can't vouch how realistic it is
"yeah, I am a sucker for nice worlds to explore in a game haha, which is why td2 is always a game that's sorta like, in the back of my mind I just need to remember to pick it up on sale now lol."
"Ooh I actually own a copy of anthem, maybe I'll give it another try"
It sounds like the game is on auto-pilot while a small team works on it in the background so you have a good year or so before anything may change
"@RonInDune at this point I'm not sure that the story can be awful, but gameplay might be rough for DA4"
@thegoaliebear https://twitter.com/videogamedeals/status/1226652623236976642?s=20
Your request for a cheap division 2 has been answered
Hahaha why did the first response I see @ Donald Trump
But it's not PC
"Sadly, no"
but that was not specified
but it is *ridonkulously* cheap
We should all just play Worlds
it is cheap...but i aint playing that on ps4 💀😂😂
What's world's?

@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 getting us a full level by himself tomorrow
https://twitter.com/ldr_v2/status/1226956146851926016?s=20
I feel this
I have only done.. maybe 6k-ish...
You and your 1/1 Anarchy
:pepef:
I wanna run Scourge again to see if I can get another and be 2/2 :pepefingers:
I would rather have the sparrow tbh
I heard it helps with enemies not shooting at you
"*as often. They still shoot at you, you just get less agro"
"@Crizum nah, I'll get only 27500 tomorrow"
ooohh
still useful
@Thawxtem If you need a 3rd I can join PoH but I already completed this week on all my chars so I'll stay as alternate for now
"Same, I've done it on all three bit I'm on stand by if needed"
"If anything, go into Destiny LFG and post... it takes literally 3 seconds to get 50 people LOL"
Then  you have to weed everyone out lol
"I’d rather have calm and collected clan at least until I finish it once, otherwise I most likely will get yelled at"
I think I have boss cp on my titan... if you don't care for doing the full run
the likelihood of someone who hasn't done it yet from here joining is pretty low. so you'll probs be with the couple who have done it a lot...that makes it easier to learn anyway I think aha.
I've done that thing twice. and that was too many times for me😂
I haven't done it this week so I'm down to try
Plus I can help get you any missing lore
I think PoH wouldn't be nearly as annoying if the ai wasn't all janked to fuck during some of the encounters lol
"Knights randomly respawning, ogres sniping you from several miles away"
To name a few
Despawning**
"@AhRealMonsters thanks but I’d like to fully understand and be able to finish each encounter. (I keep getting stuck in the room after the invincible ogres, and I’d like the satisfaction of finishing that room under my belt)"
@RonInDune lovin my lore buddy!
@Thawxtem that makes sense. You're talking about the cursed ball dunking area... fun place with all the adds haha
Fun... that’s one word...
How does one do that room solo without the wipe mechanism activating?
You have to be very quick and makes lots of murder happen
Or do the ball dipping glitch
I have never attempted... maybe @Jeremy has?
Oh.. jeremy can tell you that part lol
Sweats McGee over there :lul:
@RonInDune help I need all the lore I think
"I mean all I'm going to do is have the youtube video open lol, but yea join in for sure"
It's mostly the getting through the encounters bit :luxieSip:
We can do Xenophage too if anyone's missing that
Start that quest line so you can do it along the way
It is ezpz
@Kimarais/Nick and I 2 manned it
Boss sucks to deal with though
When I did it I was like 960-ish and it was tough as heck
Gun is kinda nuts in the right situations but the boss slaps you silly unless you're above 970ish
Mostly depends on if @Thawxtem needs it. I know I got it when it came out.
"Bring a kinetic with osmosis (one person) / iza for the kinetic version (second person).. then secondary with one element, and a heavy machine gun for the last element"
"Also, Xeno shreds in Gambit Prime..."
ball dipping
i always ball dip
:odaWink:
"so as a hunter, i used tether and i was able to solo it"
but i died at the boss and i got triggered
warlock would be easiest
and ball duplication is a thing that you could do to rush past the encounter
gonna do a solo run of PoH rn
time to have fun woohoo
"Just catching up now, I swear if monsters gets the sparrow on his next sotp"
https://media.tenor.com/images/b38ba1fbbc512826c1264b4a8687d98f/tenor.gif
:dattoRAGE:
@Jeremy let’s see who finishes first: you soloing starting now or us 3 man-ing tonight. 3 hour head start
i died right after the curse encounter
because game big dumb
me upsetti spaghetti
Strong urge to post spaghetti anime now...
Go on about this spaghetti anime....you have my attention
ok we have quarantine breach over here
LOLOL
WE HAVE A 2319
Don’t know how to spoiler image... sorry

God damn it
Maybe they'll fix Dawnblade
Why can't they do this stuff when I am at work
:reeeeeee:
Reset needs to be on Mondays
Since mondays suck
@Thawxtem I'm ready whenever
join the chat
did they fix dawnblade yet?
not yet
https://warmind.io/community/fractaline
why is making music so *hard*
"like jesus, i spent 3 hours, 3 HOURS, and all i have to show is a shitty lead and baseline..... :reeeee:"
"I forgot just how much i dislike the cruicble. Every quest that sends me there is made of ass. Uncooked, dry ass."
i feel you
that seems to be the general consensus
"after i got recluse, i told myself that im never touching survival again"
*EVER*
Meanwhile I'm just over here enjoying Crucible when I can actually play
I haven't gotten a single PVP Related weapon and noone can make me.
"i mean, dont get me wrong, i love crucible"
mostly because.... swords are fun
but other then that
Oath i'm using Jotun out of spite lol
i often find myself running in cricles
I like crucible when there isn’t pressure on me to do super well for quest progress
due to mass stupidity of most players
If I’m drinking and can relax I’m having fun
I mean Jotunn only works against people who can't strafe. The second you get someone who can hold A or D Jotunn kinda falls off as a weapon
Is a cool gun though
If I’m using a weapon type I hate I’m not
favorite weapon types
The only time I really enjoyed crucible is when we had our clan inhouses
Which is my own fault for wanting the shiny shooty bang bangs and titles
I just enjoy clicking heads tbh
Plus since I’m still not used to m&k im in the console meta
does the dawnblade glitch work in crucible?
but dont
I want to note here that my major problem with the cruicble is that I am Very Bad At It.
SON OF SHIT
and i realise this is a me problem
dude
i felt that sam
The matchmaking isn’t good
i got pit against a clan of hackers once
"It’s just not, they can’t figure it out, I dunno if it’s a player base issue or what"
that was fun
"talking about crucible:
_several people are typing_"
True enough! But there is a differance between this is bad and I do not enjoy this thing.
what about gambit
anyone suddenly finding that fun
See Gambit I like.
or is that just me
I'm that guy i guess
"Gambit is fun, gambits issues stem from the burn methods people employ"
If gambit had a freelance playlist it would go over better
if only shaxx got along with drifter
this world would be a better place
but noooooooooo
"Yeah, MM right now is in a weird spot.

In terms of getting better at PvP and Crucible in general, it take some time and some effort. You should ask yourself if you want to dedicate yourself to playing Crucible and trying to improve.
@Arixama can attest to me absolutely hating PvP a while ago, back in S3 it took me 5 hours to win a single game. I loathed the mode, absolutely hated it. Loved it in D1 but couldn't stand it in D2Y1. But I put the time in, and got a little help here and there to get better and now I'm pretty good (not to be a narcissist)"
that sounds pretty narcissistic
I mean literally a year after I started trying to get better at the mode I won a tourney
Good point that. I have taken three months off the game as well. Which i'm sure contributes.
He is good thou. You should see what Oath can do with a sword :3
*rocky starts playing*
Next season will be a crash course
Yeah I just don't know how else to word that really without coming off as a narcissist
@Oathbreaker what are your thoughts on swords in PvP
They're in a weird spot
"I hate them, honestly"
But I respect the fuck out of people who commit to using them
Y'all are fucking madlads
im tryna make use of swords
i wish heavy ammo wasnt a pain to get in PvP
"To me the only use of a sword is for 3 peeking which I hate. Otherwise, you're better off using other weapon types"
"see I don't agree with that, because then people go back to picking HMG ammo up every minute"
I for one do not like being killed by the same Hammerhead for the 15th time in a row
Do they still get the same 40ish rounds?
I think it's cut down to 30 something now?
and swords only geet like 5 swings.....
I could be wrong and I'm in the middle of re-writing an assignment so I can't really check
"That's the other issue with swords. You have to fully commit to a close range fight contending with shotguns, HCs, and just any close range weapon, burn ammo for blocking, just to swing once and hopefully get a kill"
"I JUST GOT AN AD FOR DESTINY WHILE PLAYING DESTINY, IM FINISHED"
They're hilarious ambush weapons though. Crouching to put yourself off radar and then standing near a doorway or whatever and instakilling anyone who steps through is great.
"well you see, @Oathbreaker people cant hit shit"
at least when im using a sword
"Maybe in your lobbies lol, I tend to face the QP gods for the most part"
Know what’s kinda hilarious now?
When you see those crucible videos of the insane PvP gods they are all in Supremacy
Because no one plays Supremacy and god help your sanity if you do
Plus iirc it’s CBMM
"""CBMM"" more like it"
"we need to replace control with momentum control, permanently"
Well yeah as well as “SBMM”
I've matched more people from other continents than I did with Battle.net servers
"I mean the SBMM system works for the outer extremes from what I can tell, but it's in a wonky state for the middle of the population"
I did find out about Engagement Based Matchmaking and that’s our nightmare future
that's the one where the game adjusts values in an engagement based on player skill yeah?
so fucking ridiculous
engagement based?
how tf does that work
Which can be tweaked to mean the people that spend money in the in game shop can magically get more games where they are the killers
"They want you to play the game and be engaged, if you are losing too much they risk losing you so you get thrown down a tier basically"
oh so its basically the more you play the higher you go?
"IIRC there's a model being considered as a base where if two players, A and B, are of completely disproportionate skill levels, match each other, the game adjusts things like health values on the fly to try and ""balance"" out the fight. Basically if A is a god at the game whereas B is a half-baked potato, the game may lower A's health or damage resistance in order to make the fight ""fair"""
Oh that’s a different version of the same model I think
that's super interesting
The one I read basically would do everything in its power to keep the whales playing
I mean that's what they currently have Crizum (losing lowers your skill tier). It's a broken mess for the middle population but on the extreme edges of skill it appears to be working somewhat.
Imagine using thundercrash or golden gun on a player and they just dont die
Aka IB but always
I mean kinda but it’s still a “skill” based matchmaker
I’ll go down if I lose until I start winning again
This is a “he’s won 2/5 throw him from 4500 to 2000”
"Yeah, the model you're suggesting is *slightly* different"
With allowances for things like “keep high spenders in eververse in a lower tier for longer”
whats that a map of?
wait nm
"""the harrow"""
second to last encounter in poh
It's for Pit of Heresy
i noticed
I really should try to do solo flawless PvE stuff
but college 😦
isnt that the one with spikes n shit?
yeah it's the rolly spiky shit
lots of spikey boys and death chandeliers
i hated that one
Basically if some of the elements of Mario games got slapped into Destiny you would get the jumping sections of Pit
the ships in Kings Fall
Ngl that was fun
I liked the ship puzzle
fuck that second or third last one though
that fucker required such a specific position to land on
Hunters begone
Of course Y2 was when I was maining Hunter in D1 lmao
"""Oh you want to land this jump? Better have Bones of Eao and triple jump equipped or you're screwed"""
That or Bones and High jump
do you need to be forging a weapon to receive a piece of armor from the armor-getty-thingy
in the black armory forge
"From what I remember, yes."
"I also am still dirty about the warlock forge set, which looks like someone just glued tupperwear onto a person."
"i just ran into a guy in gambit with 71 GoS completions, monka-fucking-s"
one of my friends has over 700 completions of scourge of the past
it may sound like i'm making it up or exaggerating but i am 100% serious right now
shes actually insane
"i believe it, especially if you are like practicing speed runs on scourge, since they are so fast"
but jesus i would go insane
I mean another part of it is probably just to stay on the # of completions world leaderboard
"About the harrow map above when I was trying to solo it what made easier to navigate there was knowing exactly what every ! is. so from left to right: rolls going up and down; rolls going forward and backwards and last one on the right are lanterns. Also when you get a witch in the middle left dont ever approach it through the middle area, you'll be in a ledge with traps nearby and it really sucks"
"https://imgur.com/a/qffqMeH for ogre part what I found the easiest way was go to 4 to take an orb, exit on the right side and get the shortcut between 4 and 2 and dunk on the right. then go to 2, get an orb and dunk middle. go to 1 and dunk last orb."
ok they're finally fixing the dawnblade spam
bit unorthodox but I see what they're going for
Why not disable the sub class?
warlocks have become too powerful
bungie is their only kryptonite
*disabled warlocks* lmaooo
Real patch notes are quite underwhelming
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/Update/48719
I guess banana triumph is just to make pve completionists play a bit more banana
I've sure I didn't get enough for 50 packages while I did the quest/bounties
I spent all my Iron Banner tokens trying to get the Enhanced mods
I didn't play one match of IB all of y3 so far. and I love that for me.
It's not very fun honestly
don't think that triumph will do anything to make pve players play ib lol.
bc it's garbage anyway.
"I got the quest and bounties done in the first time. Second time I picked the bounties, played 1 match and deleted them all"
I spent the whole time cheesing with Blast Furnace and Jötunn and felt bad about it
I don't have much time to play anyway. so when I do get the chance I'm not gonna spend my time in pvp lol.
One was like 250 kills wtf
I might play a bit being a complete monkey for MT quest. If I see some progress I'll get the glory
"MT is honestly worth grinding for, it's one of the best primaries in the game"
who?
mountaintop
I only know of Randy's and Revoker.
never heard of her.
Yeah I will give a shot. Yesterday I played a bit with zero skill colony and got 8% and 5% progress but zero medals
"I never use MT on PvP, beacuse I tend to kill myself with it"
but in PvE it's godly
I honestly couldn't be bothered. only reason I got recluse was bc I got lucky with my lfg group.
Recluse is easier to get and it's a pretty good gun to use anyway
I wih the PvE pinacles were as good
well now it's easier. back when the glory system was ass it was a headache.
Revoker I still need a bunch of kills but I would like to get that done in the future
For Revoker just stay back all the time and get easy bodyshot kills
they can't make pve pinnacles good. they need a reason to force people into pvp lmao.
Yeah thats exactly how it works
grinding strikes to the point of monotony ?? child's play. if you're not getting an aneurism from wanting to smash your keyboard bc of how bad crucible is then bungie doesn't want it.
very sad lol
having fun with weird load outs in strikes ?? what is fun?
go in pvp where you turn the corner and see 4 red sniper dots looking right at you. now that's fun.
I see why this clan is pve centered
we're people of taste.
"Yesterday I played some matches, got chaperone crucible step done. Tried colony to see MT progression"
Since there is no more point to do anything but 980NF I might play colony again today
I don't even have a point to do 980nf lol.
Its great for ascendant shards and exotics
I liked playing earlier this season but without a raid I am lost lmao.
It drops exotics with high stats
"my thing with ascendant shards is like, I have my one armor set that has good rolls and is all master worked."
and with how you can just swap mods...I don't need more shards. gets stagnant.
"I have enough again now that I can get a full set for my warlock master worked 

*if they enable warlocks again*"
"I like to masterwork stuff, my orpheus build is fully masterworked. For my nighthawk Im missing the mask. My alts also have full masterworked armor"
yeah see i just don't have that amount of time for the game lol.
But sadly my 980NF buddy pretty much quit the game
personally i think ascendant shards should be given more frequently in the season pass.
"because, like you mention the 980 nightfalls, the great majority of the player base doesn't even bat an eye toward those."
Yep that's true
how many do you even get out of the season pass?
"Maybe 3, idk"
I like doing the 980 NF beacuse they're basically the only challenging PvE activity in the game right now
i think that's right aha.
Kinda pitiful that
"I agree Ron, that's one of the reasons I like it too"
"but yeah. i don't do 980 nfs. and it's just because of my time constraints. i'd rather just finish out the season pass, and once that's done maybe i'll do some."
yea that's a good idea anyway
"but i think you should get a bonus 2 shard for completing the season pass, so you get 5 out of it."
"that way, if you're a player who doesn't do 980 nf due to your PL restraint or you are a casual player who just does enjoy grinding out bounties and stuff, each season you would have enough to masterwork a full set of gear that you like."
Personally I would farm 980nf everyday but one thing is lfg one guy other is lfg 2 guys
yeah that's a good idea
https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1227273354052112387
"i do the gunsmith bounties whenever i can. so like, i do have the ability to buy ascendant shards every so often if there's something i *really* want to masterwork."
Thats good but they also need to add a way to get good armor. Season pass has high stats but there is no other way to reliable farm them
the armor you get from leveling up the obelisk are always ass lmao.
Raids drop their own seasonal armor so there is no way to farm dawn armor specifically
i got lucky on my warlock that my gear from the season pass dropped with really nice rolls for what i like to play on my warlock.
It seems to me the cap is 66 or really close to that. Besides season pass armor I've a handful of 66 stats and not a single one higher
yeah i have never gotten higher than 66 either.
Sundial rewards would have been a good way to farm out that armor. like you get to choose your reward anyway based on what you have unlocked. add the armor to it aha.
"Maybe it could let you choose one high stat per week, kinda like how pinnacle works"
Otherwise it would be super easy
yeah that would be nice. *sighs* oh well haha.
like that would also keep players coming back on a weekly basis ya know. log in and play sundial each week knowing you will be able to choose one high stat armor piece. makes it easy to fill out a set and then keep coming back in hopes of maybe getting a piece with rolls more geared to what you like.
I like how they completely forgot about the Menagerie
Which had a functional system for all of these issues
Yeah but people wouldn't pay every 3 months to play menagerie
So I understand why they're doing what they're doing but that's exactly why I think it's bad
i thought menagerie was f2p now?
It's
"But they can't sell it as a new thing every 3 months, like vex offensive or sundial"
"i mean, they're definitely still trying to find some sort of balance for both casual and hardcore players. unfortunately, a perfect balance won't ever exist, so we'll just have to roll with the seasons as they come aha."
"Yeah honestly nobody has done anything quite like Destiny even now, so Bungie is basically floundering in the dark"
Like ideally we wouldn't need this seasonal activities if we have similar activities already in-game. But people wouldn't pay to have menagerie revamped or reckoning
"As much as it sucks to say they need to do what they did in D1, have guns become outdated and have newer versions to take their place"
Otherwise once you have the guns you like what’s the point of doing anything
"like from now until the end of this season, i'll just be finishing my season pass and grinding out the enhancement cores to get my ascendant shards. i can probably get on board with 980 nightfalls at the very end of the season aha."
"but i agree. i've been using the same core guns for like, the last 4-5 months. some even longer."
Cmon goalie in 1 hour-ish we can run 3 times every other day
yeah at this point I'm forcing myself to use new guns to avoid getting burnt out
Izanagi’s Reclusive Delirium
i will do them with you @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
Please join me :)
i don't mind it now because i don't have anything left to do this season haha.
I hate that exotics cost three of the exotic upgrades to masterwork
"but yeah, i can do some this week if you'd like @Sarsante - 76561197967628966"
@Crizum yeah that sucks.
Yeah its way too expensive
i thinkg orpheus rig is the only exotic i fully masterworked.
"Sure, I'm down for 980nf every time"
I’m close on a few only because body mods are so important
haha cool. i can do some thursday night if you're on then.
Yeah Sar took me and Trissin through last weeks nightfall and it was a breeze
Nah you guys carried me
i can make a post for thursday night. what are the NFs this week?
"I didnt check, maybe pyramidion... Cant recall the rotation"
Savathûn's Song
Unstoppable ogres here we go
"Also it's momentum control this week, good time to farm out your crucible catalysts"
I'm going to finish Jade Rabbit this week or die trying
mostly the latter
"well, if yall want to suffer on thursday night with me and Sar, at least we'll be together."
"Savathuns has I think 2 annoying rooms, including boss room"
"Also it's Hollowed Lair this week on the regular nightfalls, if anyone needs to farm Mindbender's"
"Yeah we can't instalkill the boss, have to wait for the Champions to spawn"
Yeah but its ok until the ogres then can go sideways
It's 2 unstoppable at the same time
well at least unstoppable mods can be on ranged rifles. them ogres no match for my randy's 👀
hahaha true
and the tenderizer mod is super good
see i was low key planning to do 980 nfs all along i got all those mods ready to go 😂
since you're doing randy's I'll have my izanagi's ready
hah okay. anything specific i should run in my other slots?
"I need check the shields, probably we've all of them"
divinity would help a lot
cool. i can bring divinity for sure.
ye I'll have healing nades all the time anyway to save you poor folks
you can save me holding E lol
this is probably easier than the thorn mission
lmaooo mood.
"god Ron, giving me war flashbacks here."
that was *so* hard
"yeah thorn was kinda annoying, tried to solo and cried for help"
i might have *actually* cried a bit during that quest.
"I found the Malfeasance mission to be one of the easier ones, even more so than the wishender"
"That wishender fight was in such a cool area too, I wonder why they never brought it back ever again"
Shaxx is kinda confused https://prnt.sc/r0v4a6
just the easier nightfalls
he just wants to show his love for zavala.
"I dislike the malfeasance mission very much. went there, remember what mission is and immediately went back to orbit"
oof https://prnt.sc/r0vbv7
here we go again boys https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1227298035769565185?s=20

@Oathbreaker mindbender's week
Lol it seems they nuked people's currencies and mats again?
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/f2bus3/all_my_shards_and_crafting_material_is_gone_they
Yeah I saw it's Mindbenders week
It's also Insight Terminus sniper week
What's that gun called again
The Long goodbye?
Think so
It's a decent PvP sniper
Just want some more options and variety lmao
Isn't apostate supposed to be pretty good too?
I don't like Apostate
People really like it but the fucking rectangular scope throws me off
The zoom also sucks in comparison to Twilight Oath which is my preferred energy sniper
For 140s that is
Beloved is king of the 90rpms
bite of the fox
"So I dunno if it’s just the one reddit post or not, but are people up in their feelings about Revoker now that trials is coming back and secondary ammo may be more limited?"
I'd rather use Revoker tbh
Beloved and Borealis both feel very good
sorry I'm not cool enough to join the revoker gang
I'm running Revoker/Ancient Gospel in comp right now
Bite is a good option for primary snipes
"I actually have like no progress in that quest, I should do it"
Otherwise use Supremacy honestly
this is really embarrassing
For primary yeah Supremacy is brilliant
I don't have a good supremacy roll
The kinetic 90rpms aren't good IMO
I sharded them all to make space in vault
Bite will do
"Doesn't matter the roll, use it for the good lore"
(also it shades very well)
Can we get the no land beyond :)
put on Bergusia forge shader and it looks supremely cool
"on m&k it would be pretty nasty, I take that back"
what was that?
A sniper?
"Yeah, it was an exotic sniper in d1"
ah yeah we need some energy snipers
NLB would be really really strong in D2's sandbox
A primary ammo sniper with literally no zoom
It was the only primary sniper in D1 right?
So yeah it was a scout rifle on human growth hormones
"There were two special ammo weapons that used primary ammo in D1, both were meta-defining and snipers in their own right; No Land Beyond and Universal Remote"
"Incorrect

Vex mythoclast would literally one shot you at one point in time"
Vex was so busted on release
Was a glorious time
Depends which side of the gun you were on
I saw the Datto video on Vex Mythoclast and it was destroying people
Y'know what meta I don't miss from D1
Doctrine of Passing
Fuck that bullet hose shit
I saw people in the comments from like 6 years ago complaining they'd never seen a single exotic and that they're too rare
I think exotics are too easy to get in d2
they _should_ be super rare
huh Doctrine of passing looks like the Halloween auto rifle
I feel like in D1 legendary engrams dropped just a little more than exotics do now
Same model yeah Ron
making them more common kind of takes away from the novelty
woah ok that's tough
but also the vendors
Ron will never know the pain
Exotic drop rate was also like.... D2 world drop rate of an exotic
"You see an exotic engram, you go to rahool"
*legendary*
That was never a thing Crizum
Because when they had the lower level rarity Engram shit exotic engrams didn't drop
They didn't start dropping until Y2
Wait was it purples became blues?
oof even that's bad
"Now, legendary decrypting into blues was some *bull fucking shit*"
no wonder people hate Rahool lol
I mean they could upscale too right?
Could you pull from collections or was that not a thing yet?
So a blue could theoretically be a purple?
No collections iirc
"Ron will also never know the pain of Warlocks having Sunbracers sold 7 weeks out of 10 by Xur, or all exotics dropping as Crests of Alpha Lupi"
"No collections at that point, no"
And yeah they could upscale but it was uber rare
"D2 vanilla was them listening to every complaint about D1, turns out the community doesn’t know what it actually wants"
"The issue is they listened to *every* complaint about D1. There's gonna be a hard split between the two sides. Some loved the changes, others hated them."
They should have committed earlier to PvP and PvE being separate for balance I feel haha
"Like a base, competitive PvP mode and the fiesta mode where you bring your PvE stuff in and everything is bullshit"
I know that isn’t what they want but eh
I miss chaos dogma
hmm that might be harder to maintain in the longer run
"1.Maintain
2.Crucible
Pick one"

My warlock...
Roll us back to vanilla D1 tbh
I can only imagine how stressful their job is
Oh I’m sure they have a crying room
https://gyazo.com/0401e4cef860baa62014220b4e959f3c
"why are we here, just to suffer?"
It’s like the end credits in Monty Python and the Holy Grail over there
We apologize for the inconvenience caused by our apologies for the prior inconvenience
7 PM PST is wild
Yeah that’s insane
They just didn’t want us to smash the remaining fractaline donation levels
it's the same as last time and its actually pretty expediant
i wonder if it's the same issue again
they heard me yesterday😂
"95% off, jesus"
td2 has serious issues
https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/f2dacs/bungie_needs_a_new_cto/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I liked it for the hour or so I played it
"I've 1600hs give it or take, it has serious issues"
goddam
it's not a bad game per se but massive/red storm devs in charge of it are really bad
"it super hard to get good loot, game gets stale because there is no content what they do? change all talents and stuff so you need to refarm everything"
those sound like repeating mistakes from TD1
"game is not out for 1 year, I had to refarm everything 3 times, quit in the 4th time and now it's the 5th time gonna need to refarm"
"Div2 was kinda fun when I first played it but it just didn't have the same feel that Div1 did, Div1 held me hostage for a *long* time"
"also they promised second raid for last october, it's not out yet"
there is no relevant additional content since may/june when the raid was released
they released a couple missions here and there and that's all
well that's why I was waiting for a massive sale lol. I would never buy it full price😂
I pre ordered the most expensive version *facepalm*
"td2 raid speedrun, back then it was the second or third best time in the world https://youtu.be/g6_GYsqCad4"
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 gotta be honest that sounds like me and Destiny
"“I put 2,000 hours in the game, no content big issues”"
"but it's true, content they announced as part of year 1 pass being delayed for months"
"also what they delivered really below expectations, not only mine"
the worst is not even the lack of content is they make everything you took like 500 hours to get useless
imagine every d2 season you delete your chars and start over
It seems like Division 2 could have been an expansion for 1 but they made it its own thing?
And now Division 1 stuff is an expansion for 2?
it seems so
I didnt bother research but rumour is year 2 of division 2 we'll go back to nyc
idk if it's gonna be a remastered map or a new part of the map
"The expansion leaked, and yeah"
it's not clear to me
You fight some division agent turned bad guy
thats probably keener
Yeah him
"division has a good lore, but it's very poorly told"
"I just want to know what the hell happened to April, that's all it matters to me"
"her story is part in division 1, part in a companion book and it has one little piece in division 2"
https://youtu.be/fVSImxpt2Hw
the game just looks cool to me so I just got it on that promo. $3 is something I can spare for a game I'll just kinda mess around with haha
that's a very tom clancy plot
"pretty cool, reminds me a bit of Crysis 2"
it's not a bad game at all
devs are just bad at their jobs and dont deserve the IP
Apparently *Outriders* is the next Destiny killer on the horizon
Look generic as hell though
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y4W3j1lemU&feature=emb_title
"gtfo seems fun but well you need friends to play, there is no matchmaking"
yeah I want to try out gtfo someday if enough people are interested
"I’d be interested but I don’t have the money right now @RonInDune, I’m also interested in The Hunt: Showdown"
"oh another ""destiny killer"" so how long will it take them to reboot that game?"
Honestly the game's made by the same people who made Bulletstorm so I don't think the franchise was ever truly alive
never even heard of it either haha.
well... I'm glad I could add TD2 to my library tho lol.
I liked bulletstorm 😦
FWIW Square is also behind it
So odd how they run SE and Eidos separately
"may i just say, that the division 1 was a mind blowing game"
at least when it came out
i loved it
it was almost as good as ghost recon
I've wanted to live in a snow covered city ever since the game
You think that Ron but you don’t
"yeah no, especially a city"
Eh how bad can it possibly be
I think I have a sweater somewhere
"people do not, repeat do not know how to drive in snow"
they say they do
"but when worse comes to worse, you can kiss you nice shopfront goodbye"
It's 2020 where's our hover boards anyway
I love snow
I like living in snowy places
It seems like Anthem plus The Division
what does?
"bruh, D2 had a 0 mb update"
i like the direction of  the new ghost recon
"because in wildlands, you were literally unkillable"
"but in this new one, its nearly impossible to stay alive....."
unless you have skill... *which I don't*
"Just watched the actual trailer for Outriders, it seems like angry destiny"
And the color palette screams mid-gen 360/ps3 brown to me
no bright colors?
There is some sharp green in there somewhere
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pUGIgrjUlk
"I don't know why, but I think of Lawbreakers when I see it"
And we all know how that went
"it looks like Battlefield, but with laser rifles....."
"Destiny has at least a small sense of hope lol, a lot of other games seem to lean hard on “Everything is shit, you’re shit, I’m shit, the enemies are bigger shits. Go kill the shit out of those shits”"
you just described every game perfectly
As if suddenly all the game directors had nihilistic breakdowns
"It’s like, buddy, I already wanna kill myself don’t make it even worse"
"wait no, outriders look like rage"
just with dark browns
"Why do some developers insist on boring, monotone color palettes?"
They rarely work
because that implies death and destruction
"i mean, look at doom 2016"
"Idk, why do developers lean on white guy with shaved sides of head or angry Mohawk lady"
"colors are as follows, red, red, more red,  some brown, a little black and yellow, oh, and more red"
Doom knows what it is and leans in to it and is better for it
“Go fucking murder everything while Mick Gordon just shreds this guitar WHY ARENT YOU KILLING”
cant wait for doom: eternal to come out
"maybe boring monotone color palettes imply post apocalyptic setting, like fallout"
Yeah it’s shorthand for “everything’s gone to shit”
Which makes me appreciate Bungies art design team
Bungie is great tbh
I dont agree with everything and they fuck up but still
how many more expected dlc?
We’re all just disappointed parents
“You could do so much more why are you flipping burgers”
"For Destiny 2? I’d expect seasons and a medium scale expansion every September for at least two years, until the new consoles get established"
then they will start work on something that isnt destiny 3
"Remember that they are working on a new IP, of which we barely know any details"
I don’t want it Ron I want destiny to be good 😦
"you can only go so far with an idea, before it becomes a bore"
like star wars
Star Wars has limitless potential and they focused it on a small group of characters and mismanaged the ip. Destiny could go anywhere
Well there are some hints as to what they're working on:
We have lots of planets and stars
"destiny is good, could be better but still good"
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/bellevue-devs-bungie-working-on-new-open-world-rpg-says-source-1
Could be good
i like the word open world
words
"i dont like open worlds that much, I like to click in a mission and play it instead of walk there"
i would love to have a complete open world Destiny.
No thanks
something like fallout
but destiny?
I don’t want a solid thousand or so warlocks glitching supers and crashing my pc
well they have concept art there but it seems more like mobile games
meh lmao. different tastes. I like the way Destiny is set up. I want more exploration in the worlds out of it tho.
1 thousand shoulder charges
moar maps
but yeah that it is multiplayer would make a complete open world element not good lmao.
*fallout 76*
*ahem*
Sometimes I think it would be cool if they did something like the 24 person raids in FFXIV
infinite fireteams
But that would also be a hellscape for lfg
hahaha very true.
they do talk about larger player instancing:
Ron no stop
I'm gonna get ya
Crizum needs some animemes
https://gyazo.com/9fc4648f8a5e7466b74a1b55621dbaed
:POGGIES:
WE IN BOYS
https://thehardtimes.net/harddrive/bungie-incorporates-masturbate-emote-into-destiny-2-so-players-can-truly-go-fuck-themselves/
Nice I will be able to play today
anyone willing to help me do whisper of the worm?
I want get the bow because reasons I know I'll probably use it once for 2 minutes
bow was nice when i got it originally
"Yeah I can help, would be best with a third cause it’s been awhile"
I can run whisper if we run heroic after lol
thawtem and I tried 2 man-ing it last night and we made it to the final room
I want start working in the catalyst but I can't solo that
Yeah that’s fine with me just look up where the chests are
Still can’t get in btw
I need to complete once to get the drop
then it needs the chests
I still need the outbreak catalyst too
idk the zero hour heroic path tho
"it has some changes, I watched a video but wasnt able to do it"
damn bungie probably rolled back the weekly bounties I completed this morning
"nah dim says they're there, nice... I'm starting to save weekly bounties for next season"
next season?
preparing this early is a genius idea
https://gyazo.com/0de67b17d46c1ceae7c3a11ebf0ba226
what about it?
sooo many people
@Saint 14's loyal follower yep I'm level idk 330 already and still gonna get some levels from timelost bounties
I dont have any reason to claim weekly bounties
Once I get the +20 on the artifact everything is getting saved
@Saint 14's loyal follower @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 when did you wanna do whisper?
Im down to do it now
"Good with me, I’ll hop in alpha"
anybody know if you have to be forging a weapon to get armor pieces?
"give me 5 minutes pls, something came up"
@Thawxtem we need to set up a run through Zero Hour to get you Outbreak Perfected.
"But I have it already... masterworked, even"
"I have to use Izanagi's so much, that it takes up my exotic usually"
that and no one else uses it at the same time for maximum effect
it will be my first time in CoS
*war flashbacks*
*flawless*
"Relatively easy, once you get the gist of it"
*war flashbacks intensify*
IT WILL ALSO BE MY FIRST TIME
oops caps lock
that raid is easy as shit i just hate it now lol.
and you dont hate scourge?
GOOD LUCK IWANT2NOW
Goal when “crown of sorrow” or “1k voices” is said in chat
@thegoaliebear when someone mentions CoS
flawless runs always ruin raids for me. except with GoS and Scourge.
"We had the same idea, @Crizum"
LOL DEADASS
agent orange really did a number huh?
i also didn't like the aesthetic of CoS. the armor for hunters looked cool as hell. but the raid itself was just...meh after a little bit.
I love it for how terrifying the hunter armor is
*toes*
the claws are the best.
But for the most part it’s leviathan with barnacles
lmao for real.
i wanna run a 10x leviathan
"In general, I'd just like to find the time to do more Raids in general so people don't assume little of me when they look me up on raid report"
We should have a Leviathan raid marathon on Valentines to celebrate our one true love: Calus
I want to run Last Wish for 1k volces
it'll be the Le Mans of gaming
I'll be an alt for tomorrow night's run tho. wouldn't mind *hopefully* getting some of that hunter gear with hopefully good rolls.
"@Peronix ya know, for being our one true love, it's strange how we don't have an emote for him, yet we have one for the murder of our favorite hunter"
*flashbacks to cayde intensify*
By those standards we actually thirst for the drifter with how many emotes he has
the drifter is bae
I wish he was my Uncle
"I mean, yes"
i love him with my heart and soul
I meant discord...
"@Thawxtem raid report isn't everything, and people generallh care more about badges than # of clears"
Speak it in to existence like I did with the godforsaken anime channel
I can see that I've been pinged in the anime channel
The anime chat got thirsty really quick
"person once kicked me out of a random raid group with ""no requirements"" because I hadn't done the raid enough times"
But I don't want to open it because I'm in public
i still want a Looking-for-anime chat
me when i got my 1kv and fucked out of last wish forever:
dino-girl
i blame mugetsu
I have not run Last Wish once since I got 1KV I think
I feel you
Dino girl best girl
"it might as well be called ""mugetsu's playplace"""
you blame me for what?
*everything*
the amount of thirst in the #animemes-maybe-nsfw chat
I appreciate @LW Mugetsu
lol thank @Trissin
"but the good thing is, they make me laugh"
Thank Von Zant for asking for anime suggestions in the first place that led to the eventual quarantine area labeled animemes
then someone was teaching @RonInDune about waifus
that's when the take over really happened
I think that was stage 3; there was a stage 2
waiit WInter's Guile is *still* disabled?
"could I please get some help real quick? I need to complete one reckoning, and if I go into orbit the weekly quest will expire. Just one completion and I'll be finished"
Y'all like Animal Crossing?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IndDk5xtye0
Lol we failed three times on outbreak
On our success we got the triumph for being fast
dang I still don't have that one
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48723
Do we have a TD2 clan?
We’re gonna I’m guessing
"The real question is, where's our Anthem clan"
"Not gonna lie I’m interested in it, but the beta gave me motion sickness"
It's good until you finish the story. There's no endgame besides three (four?) missions
"Yeah, the Beta was fun to play around in"
Less content than Destiny 2 at launch
I don't like the loot system in anthem
I'm pretty sure you just earn the same weapons over and over again
*laughs in Misfit*
"Yeah, loot was a bummer as well. I also remember when the lvl 1 pistol was the best weapon in the game"
It had some real weird scaling
I decided I should embrace the calling to become trash https://prnt.sc/r1cv7c
you can do it!
"Oh man, truly best of luck sar"
Embrace the Strength of the Fighting Lion
That grind almost killed me
"Same, trissin, same"
yeah it's annoying
Tether in mayhem is the only way for me
that should work pretty well
I ran triple grenade launcher in crucible for a month straight
"im running momentum control, swapping back and forth between martyr + colony and fighting lion"
use the militia's birthright too
"I feel martyr and colony suits me better, requires less skill lol"
yeah martyr is a great gun on it's own
Since it's 2 difft triumphs I might try comp and ruin ofher ppl day but progress is faster
Then later if I've time left I grind glory or do the glory part next season
baby steps but eventually I'll get there https://prnt.sc/r1f1rr
"""Baby steps"" its been only a few hours  and you've progressed so much"
oh they decreased the requirements right? now it's slightly more sensible
"they did Ron, but still quite grindy https://prnt.sc/r1f75z"
yeah it's still pretty bad lol
Find a trade lobby
"I tried that, no success"
oh man that always feels a bit cheaty
it does indeed
Idk I look at it like
You cheese bosses right?
Skip mechanics all the time
I wouldnt mind at all tbh but it does feel cheaty
if pvp wasn't so terrible trade lobbies wouldn't even need to be a thing haha.
yea but doing that in PvP feels like it crosses some line
just my opinion
well I guess when I get it I'll never use a gl again
Hah
everytime I use MT in PvP I kill myself more than anything else
"ehh...i think with raid bosses, using cheeses is almost fun in a way like ""yo, look at this ridiculous method we can use to kill a boss."" but with pvp it's like ""this is literally so awful no one would ever want to do this legit"""
"and then the people who do it legit think they have some kind of like, moral high ground or whatever lmao. it's just bad every way you look at it."
To me there is legit no difference between a cheese lobby and getting a streamer to carry you to 5500
oh i agree lol.
You have put in the same amount of work as win traders
both are sketchy to me
"it's like, you're still dedicating your time to getting it done regardless."
"honestly, if pvp was at least decent, there wouldn't be so many ads and sites for paid recovs."
i think it just speaks volumes to how bad of a state it's in. people would rather pay someone hundreds of dollars to get them to 5500 and do luna's/nf than spend their time doing it themselves.
Well there will always be people with more money than time
Back when I played final fantasy xi there was decent money selling in game gear to like middle eastern businessmen or princes
yeah I agree pvp is really bad but I cant see a way to fix it and still be a destiny pvp
There are tons of people to whom money means nothing
It’s a flex
"what makes destiny destiny, the movement, the abilities, supers... if you tune everything down will be better pvp but wont be destiny"
"yeah for sure. i got lucky with my friend who offered to do luna's/nf for me. like, i would have never done it and i would have been perfectly fine without it lmao. but he offered 🤷‍♀️"
Yeah but you’re a GIRL
I can pretend to be a grill
I’m kidding lol I had friends help queue with me to get recluse for the MMXI title
Rover helped me to get my recluse as well
Not gonna lie kinda wanna play crimson days for some of that loot
I was stuck at like 1400 glory and he carried me in like 7 matches to get 2100
But I’d lose out on 666 valor
Did you see you get matching emblems if you buy both sparrows?
"THere's too many sweats in Crimson days sadly, I won one and got stomped every other time"
Do you need to win or just participate?
the state of momentum is basically a ton of ppl doing MT
it's disgusting
Wait for Mayhem and use tether trap with colony
just participate
Well if anyone wants to do the non PvP crimson days stuff let me know
"Im using colony, easiest thing to get kills"
@Crizum I'm working on my bounty right meow if you want to run a few
Until The Division 2 finishes downloading lol
TD2 was a 56 gig download dang
Used my office connection to do it
Sounds good hopping on now
okie dokie
Finishing my match
anyone for finishing today's crimson bounties?
Lost sector and one story mission
I'm gonna be back on around 8 cst if you haven't gotten them done I'd be down
"I think one of my bounties will time out before then, but we can do the other"
Ok. I need the nightfall for two and campaign mission
yea same
I can Ron
"cool after this match then, thanks"
i'm stuck on joining fireteam hmm
ah it says destination full
"Ah okay I’ll go to orbit, in general chat as well"
"In case you didn't get it last season, here are the secret triumphs for Crimson days:"
Anyone care to do Crimson Days bounties? Warning though: I need a quick break about every 40 minutes or so to apply spray paint
I need the nightfall and campaign mission in a fireteam of 2. I'll be on around 8pm cst.
Weren't you doing the CoS with us at 8?
Oh yeah. Completely forgot about it.
Never mind
"It looks like someone dropped out of the raid. Before we actively look for a 6th if goal doesn't want to/can't make it, could I try to contact a really nice random player I met last night? We were talking about raids and other things seeing as he hasn't played in a while"
Go ahead! Might be fun
"He was increadibly chill, and even friended me on Discord"
"i'd rather play some TD2 tonight, but if i'm needed i could join."
"My person says he's up for it, but he might need a minute more to join"
"oh shit, i completely forgot there was a raid tonight"
@Crizum @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 just making sure you two remembered the raid tonight- Iwant2now and Mugetsu both said they forgot
"i mean, im still participating"
didn't say you weren't. Didn't mean to imply that
"Yeah I remembered, still online if anyone wants to do more crimson days stuff, may as well finish it off getting everything but that triumph shell"
"oh, my bad"
I still need to win like 8 more games to get the chocolate shell
In two years of playing crimson doubles I've won 3 games in total
"@Thawxtem I do, in 1 hour right?"
"yes, although we'll need to set up a different room; I invited someone who isn't in the clan"
Do a group call maybe?
"still fidgeting in that stuff on discord- I think I just need to be friends, right?"
"just call them, and then keep adding the others to the call"
Alternatively we could always set up a dump discord? Clan members can use it to chat with fandoms if they ever have to lfg? I don’t know if there is an auto-boot function that removes people in certain ranks?
There is if they go offline without a rank I think
Has anyone here played Wolcen?
I was looking for an easy Diablo-lite game to get into but all the ARPGs these days look so complicated...
@Peronix was playing according to steam popping up while I’m doing things
well it's no Cat Quest
How easy is it to get into?
"Pretty easy. It's not as overwhelming as, say, Path of Exile."
"Nice, I might try it out then"
"No problem. I recommend getting it now, because the price will go up from $30 to $45 tomorrow"
It's leaving Early Access tomorrow
after 30 momentum control matches some progress were made https://prnt.sc/r1jixe
The rapidly defeated is the worst
tether should help
"how do you rapidly defeat enemis in crucible, with a grenade launcher"
"Tether, Play of the Game, Colony"
oh no......
Colony is good
martyr + colony
martyr is amazing
like better then fighting lion
its nuts
"I only use spare rations if I get 2 kills and dont have gl ammo, because for the medals you need 3 kills without dying"
multi kill machine
otherwise i just melee or die trying to get more ammo
"pretty toxic tbh because I dont play objectives, the triumph is my objective lol"
Is this guy fucking with us
everything going alright?
Why middle crystal dude on right tho
Why he no kill knight
He has calus emote
Why he do this
And like I don’t buy him not remembering the encounter because he “corrected” my explanation and gave the same explanation
I can’t. How you die to knight in first encounter
Sounds like a hulu customer
knight is too strong man
"""i swear i wasn't off to the side"""
He got wish ender on asking why he can’t pop crystals
smh
"he cant even do one job correctly, how is this person a functional human"
if first encounter is taking one hour no way we complete this
I got about 30 minutes on this encounter before I leave
"yeah, if it takes more then 3 tries, im out"
I'm sorry.
dont be
dont worry Thawx
i just dont think he has that WIPE mindset
We could maybe 'end' and try one or two tries with WIPE members?
"It’s just that this is not a hard encounter, and if we’re walled here we are not getting past either phase of Galhran"
that doesn't sound too promising
"Mechanics can be taught, but if you can’t kill adds idk what to do"
And the guys pc was bad during the jump and just randomly starts working? OK
gotcha...
But I got hive barrier so it isn’t all bad
It's because he's not using Misfit
"I mean, it was a while ago but when we ran CoS I recall we also had some trouble with the first encounter"
Maybe it just takes a few tries for everyone to get back into the swing of things?
maybe having a faulty fireteam-mate can be a problem too
Naw he ran out of mid way too much lol
faulty teammate
Like he’d be all the way on the right and go “I wasn’t missing from swap”
I think he only played green
"oh, when you have people denying their own mistakes then that's a really bad sign"
and he just kept munching on food in the call
Plus like
That's just free ASMR
*crunch crunch* *munch munch*
Isn’t the lounge emote from prestige?
lounge is from normal or prestige spire
idk if it's still a rare drop
yeah Peronix would love it free ASMR
"no, just spire 1st encounter"
but it used to be pretty hard to get
"mb, @Thawxtem is right"
he did say he focused on doing a lot of leviathan raids
raid report is our friend
I’m just paranoid so I always assume someone with all the tools at their disposal who is constantly out of pocket is trolling
maybe they just bad
just saying
"There's a certain level of bad that, once reached, becomes indistinguishable from trolling"
its virtually the same thing
are you guys still in that run??
oh jeez
thawx said he has to retire
"we finished 1st encounter, if that's what you mean"
is there anyone there who hasn't done crown before?
Mugetsu and iwant
that stuff was easy as hell though
We can make it happen for sure
like not difficult at all
"i mean, if you guys need +1 just ping me"
we might look at finishing later on friday/saturday
"omg, i can finally hear myself think"
yeah game said im getting tarrabah so we must finish it
_Several people are typing...._
game also said anarchy this week for me
That name is for a reason
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @RonInDune I just remembered that Friday I have an exam to take so I won't be able to do the 980 nf tomorrow.
@Trissin are you not available friday/saturday?
is it a wine tasting exam?
Sorry @Thawxtem I am actually busy for all of friday and saturday
I’m about to have a whisky tasting exam right now
I am actually busy with irl stuff
@thegoaliebear dont worry
which sucks
Only question is how drunk can I get
If you don't mind... could I try to take that NF spot?
whole bottle right now
you won't
you got work i bet
"yeah, you got divinity other day right?"
Now that I have hive barrier I may go for flawless solo pit
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?
join the club @Crizum
barrier and armaments are godlike for flawless poh
but tbh you don't need hive barrier or stuff for it
@Crizum pit is actually why I wanted to run CoS
"like, hive barrier and mods and other min/max things help"
it's so good after a dmg phase just nade some mobs for full heavy again
yeah i think hive armaments might be the only one you really ~~need~~ want
damn @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 do you have hive armaments 2.0???
I do 🙂
jealous
they drop from menagerie
i only have the 1.0 version
i am too scared to use my remaining 1.0 mods
i dont want to run out
at least you could put 1.0 on anything
yeah but I think I only have like 1 left
I ended up deleting all of mine
"same goes for fallen, taken armaments and stuff"
"oh 1 and zero for me it's the same, I would save it lol"
Taken armaments hit me hard...
"i need farm taken and fallen mods, i dont have them"
lol yeah sar gets it
we have the hoarder mentality
oh yes
i dont remember the last time my vault had fewer than 490 items in it
the struggle is real
"from time to time I clean up a bit, down to 450-ish"
but it's painful
i can't do that
"unless i'm deleting like, shaders or other garbage like that"
Yep it's super hard to delete stuff
Usually I dismantle everything below 55 stat points but every now and then I get like a 53 with only 2 points into strength so I keep it. I never spec into it but then I think strength might be good down the road so I keep pieces with high strength then my vault gets full and I need to delete stuff lol
Is tough be a hoarder
"^^^^
sometimes i feel uncomfortable even dismantling shaders because i feel like i might use it in the future and that would be inefficient"
Shaders I had to dismantle but itst a cost I'm willing to pay
half of my vault is full of iron banner armor
"So guys, how did it go?"
"uh, we quit"
@Thawxtem said he needed to go
:hehehe:
yeah if i didn't have a night class today i would have done the nightfall still aha. but i don't get home until like 9:15 and have to first start studying then 😦
maybe saturday night if you're around then?
@thegoaliebear you're off the hook tonight but not for too long :derp:
"Saturday works for me, sure"
lol okay cool.
i'm down to suffer saturday then.
"You'll see it's not that bad,  it's actually fun"
Did it yesterday with a friend and a random
if you hear me crying don't worry it's just the depression magnified by savathun's song.
lmao you're only allowed to cry from joy
"""guys thanks for making me do this, sniff"""
"""I'm so happy i got that ascendant shard"""
why does that guy look like he's about to die in a horror movie
That's a good question
it's Joe Jonas hahaha
but also relatable.
"Idk goal is always super nice and selfless when we play, like in crucible"
“Wow I’m so *happy* for you and your one eye mask” “*oh* lord of wolves I *LOVE* that for you”
"you just need to remember ogres are needy and they like to hug, so when you see 3 unstoppables ogres coming embrace your faith and let them hug you"
“Oh look at you so skilled with your blade barrage I love it”
"""you're *so* good with that handheld supernova *WOW*"""
"""I'm blown away by the skill. where's Faze? where's Cloud 9? someone sign this guy up already multi million dollar deals only"""
unstoppable ogres I can handle tho. i will let them hug me if they want to
"in fact, I'm sure they want multiple hugs and just come back for more."
"yeah, its sad to be an ogre"
"people see you and want kill you, can you imagine live like that?"
they just want hugs :((( but they are so aggressive about it.
they like it a bit too rough but I dont judge
if that's what they like they can't help it😩
today I'm gonna embrace my faith and play at least 20 momentum control matches. Im mentally not ready for it but it's what it's
may the lord be with you and with your spirit.
I'll need it
45 matches in 2 days https://prnt.sc/r20i9m
if i wasnt trash probably would be over with it
that's huge progress
the quest is just dumb
"I'm emo just looking at that, knowing it would probably take me 3 times as long"
"There’s a reason when they nerfed the quest it didn’t become easy, it just became less terrible"
holy cow that's incredible progress
yeah the time window to be considered multikill it's super tight for something like a GL
That took me an entire season and a half
"It’s still a good weapon too, I tried last word and sniper in crimson doubles and got smacked"
I spent the entirety of Season of the Drifter and much of Opulence working on that quest
but it was harder when you did it Ron
Swapped to ultra crayon eater OEM/Recluse/MT/Suppressor to actually win
it's still pretty dang hard lol
I really need to play with a team to win Crimson doubles
Getaway Artist is pretty clutch for it
"I didnt play crimson at all, got the bow by doing pve bounties lol"
true the only match I won was my teammate with getaway artist and me with constant healing nades
"Doubles is okay, but the matchmaking is all over the place"
"And idk how much I want that triumph shell honestly, it’s a lot of work in PvP and I have most of the rewards already, only missing emote and wardcliff ornament"
Just run the PvE and weekly bounties on alts
"I had all the rewards from last season already, just picked up the two sparrows"
"yeah matchmaking is nuts, kept going against unbrokens"
If you wanna win
I'll hopefully complete this MT thing in the next couple days and probably wont play crucible until next season
Take in double Symmetry
Me and @Jeremy played tuesday and were slapping ppl around. Then I played with @AhRealMonsters last night and we got fucking abused
Also yes fuck double symmetry
rob struggled with me
i was uh
shinobu's vow
clapping cheeks
and uh
rob was uh
dying
Common denominator :thonk: :thonk: :thonk: :thonk: :thonk:
must be rob
smfh
rob you suck
@AhRealMonsters
<3 you Rob
yeah double shinobu's with constant grenade spam was a nightmare @Trissin
I accept that I am not a sweaty
playing with a sweaty
or good at pvp
i think your kda is like
.4
But see me on RL
and then boom
Jesus that man has a wife a kids
Easy
irl he has a hatr
hat
strong boi
that means his kd is more then 1
Hey we won a match don’t discount yourself lol
and its
man's got kids
BACKWARDS
Rocket League btw lol
Yeah but does he eat dinner and yell at his girlfriend while raiding?
it's fun
except she hits me
and i cry
alot
Yeah but
:fpskcry:
You can click heads
i can click heads pretty well
i click
they die
usually
"how I get multikills for the quest - grab heavy, aim colony to a hallway where you expect enemies, spam all 5 rounds and pray"
Did someone say clicking heads
hi
its me
I can click heads
"Tourney time, rumble, Oath, Jeremy, Trissin, Rover"
i dont belong in there
im bad
l0l
You have the power of god and anime
so did nick
that didn't end well
The power to go even further beyond
"Rover is pretty good, idk about yall"
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
I mean uh.... I'm washed af
But I used to be good
better than mine
1.91 what? Jesus I didn’t know I was in the presence of a literal god
Behold my trash stats
I was at a 1.99 at one point
im the type of person that likes to die
and will die
for my friends
i pop off sometimes
but most of the time
im hating my life
pretty sure oath will destroy my anus
and i accept
I cant have fun in the crucible so I sacrifice myself to make other ppl feel less miserable
I will also say
"The thing for me is I'm a meta slave fwiw, I can play out of meta but I like playing with good shit"
I play on pc with a controller
So I am immediately in a wheelchair
i use revoker/NF/wardcliff
or i use austringer/retold
:peepoShrug:
I like my Spare Rations/Beloved/MB
and this is where
i say what i normally don't
i hate you
I like ace of spades because I can have a tracker *feelsbad*
spare rations seems meh to me
beloved i cannot get a good roll
Used to only used TLW/Twilight Oath but I used that for an entire season to the point of it being too boring
fair
having a good twilight oath feels goooooooooooooooood
mmmmmmmmmmm
Had curated a week into Forsaken
same with fate cries foul
"i've had a curated twilight, just never used it"
Also did you know thanks to the differences between console and pc
i was always using fate cries or sole survivor
"Fate was my OG learning sniper, now the zoom feels horrible in comparison to most other things"
The console is still in the dust rock/lunas meta
i still use dust rock and NF
Does not surprise me honestly
dust rock is good
this is what i have for mine
one second
"Okay I'm going back to studying Dynamics, have an exam in an hour"
GL
"damn, good luck oath"
https://gyazo.com/7c39c184d2ecb6946bc2b0fa01e93691
Gl
Ty all
basically max range
i thought full choke was better?
just the only one i've gotten
that i like and that's good
haven't gotten a better roll
haven't farmed them either
https://gyazo.com/8b0fcebb372fa177edd7014a579ce4fd
only good stardust i got
just got two sacred provenance from the raid
fucking F
i wanted armor for my warlock
;w;
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48727
WHOA
They did it
"||**You’ll soon be able to change the Elemental Affinity on any piece of armor to either of the other two Affinity types directly from the item’s inspection screen by hovering your cursor over the armor's energy icon. This is intended to mitigate the experience of getting an armor drop with a stat roll you want, but the wrong Elemental Affinity. Changing an armor Affinity type will cost 1 Upgrade Module.**||"
Seasonal mod slots will also be universal
I'll be able to delete so many pieces from the vault
Big news
no more triple exotics yay
Easier to have multiple sets geared towards different things
I'm so happy that I'll play more crucible now
oh I though we had a sotp scheduled
wait they don't say whether we can slot in fallen/taken/hive armaments into the season agnostic slots
I've never used this season's charges with light stuff so no love lost there
im pretty sure I have the first two columns in my artifact unlocked
and i have like 6 or 7 artifact points just chilling there
"Oh, damn changing the affinity gets pricy."
It includes the cost of energy upgrades
"If its level 10, cost is everything needed to get it to level 10 and an upgrade module"
"that might be too expensive, they'll probably tune it down later"
"Maybe a little, but it does seem to be built towards one big final set"
Although it isn't built towards changing it a lot I think
"this season mods are not great, like the damage one doesnt stack with anything besides weapon perks, so it's quite useless for end game content where you'll always have bubble/well for damage phases"
and all the lose 1 charge with 1 kill... meh
Combined with the one that gives you double charges seems like it works with masterwork weaponry
I saw someone on twitter say you can oneshot people with Le Monarque if you have the right mods
"So I know the system can be powerful, but it's too obscure"
Can testify
as that has happened to me when @Kimarais/Nick and I were playing lol
I also don't feel like I have a reason to invest into it
they're way too niche
"there is one you get charged by breaking an elemental shield, great idea... then you go play hardest content in the game but cant find a bunch of shielded enemies"
so the orbs is the most viable one but then again when you're getting a bunch of multikills are trash mobs so we dont need buff to kill them
the ideia is good but requires some rework
imo of course
"Oh okay, clarification from Cozmo on reddit"
"Armor will able to have 3 Seasons of mods used in its seasonal slot. The current season, the previous season, and the upcoming season."
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/786378289547106058/2469827D95B0F697EFBE58E81B0C80C8A8320F91/
I ENVY THIS MAN
anarchy....
okay so I don't mean to be rude or anything but
I feel like complaining about not getting the rare drop in only 6 clears is not quite justifiable
yes!!
"speaking of which, when are we doing this weeks futile 3x run"
the fallen require more sacrifice
saturday?
Saturday night or sunday works for me
Really wanna spread the depression evenly through the weekend
@RonInDune I think you have more clears of SOTP than I do now lol
"actually wait, i guess you've been doing x3 runs"
"I'm down, guaranteed anarchy after all momentum control"
I think I'm at 38 runs now. not that i care about it. it might be good for me to be in the run bc I'll never get it hahaha.
goal weren't you also around 38 for 1k?
maybe this will be the one
what else are you missing for blacksmith?
but I also got 1kv with an lfg group so that was the game's way of telling me to ditch the ps4 group.
I'm missing a lot for blacksmith but i literally don't give a single shit about it.
oh lol
like most of the forge stuff. never bothered with izanagis either. still don't care.
"maybe i'll go for blacksmith one day. just need the sotp sparrow, and then i'll actually grind out the rare bounties"
yeah i don't have the time for that nor do i want to have the time for it bc i would just never do it lmao.
i got better things to do than concern myself with old irrelevant content to me.
"there is some sort of joke to be made here with the sparrow being named ""always on time"" but I can't find it"
I think last run was only the second time I actually completed the full sparrow section
"Actually that reminds me, if Ron's internet is better then perhaps we should get him his enlightened title"
i've also ran 6 sotp's
sorry i should've specified lol that was your raid report iwant
that wasn't my profile
okay I can see how that was misinterpreted
ill find mine
"probably not this week, by internet has been having issues"
but soon-ish
I am fine to do scourge because it's fairly low risk
it is in my opinion the easiest raid
"then again, my job is usually map or add clear"
yea it's either this or eater
"yeah, maybe. You guys remember that strike from D1? ""Crota's End"" or something?"
That was a cool strike
I saw Gladd solo Crota using drumsticks
"blindfolded, drumsticks, voice commands, you name it"
idk what's sadder in that statement. the fact that he actually thought of trying that or the fact that he had the time to dedicate to that.
gotta rake in those views one way or another
Are you a true Destiny veteran if you haven't soloed a raid with a DDR dance pad?
Isn't gladd the biggest channel on twitch right now
dude's probably making big bucks
biggest channel on twitch? no way
not my favourite kind of streamer though I can appareciate what he does
is he actually?
The Corridors of Time stuff boosted him big time
"damn, that's actually crazy though"
no he's not lmao.
"He is consistent, but not giant"
"He was at one point, I know that"
https://twitter.com/GladdOnTwitch/status/1225050614008143872
I think he's since surpassed GDQ as well
that's unfortunate.
i never liked him nor the clan he's in tbh.
"redeem, right?"
"no? I'm not a huge fan of redeem, but follow ehroar pretty religiously"
for Destiny I mostly only watch Teawrex and datto tbh
never followed his channel. never watched his streams. doesn't give good vibes.
But who else will give use the gfuel to go with peronix's gamer goo?
I like to mix them together
That's optimal
this is so cursed
"It's the equivalent of steroids, but *gamer* steroids"
I'm pretty sure summit is the most subbed channel now.
"ah that makes sense, no way gladd's keeping those numbers"
I'm gonna wait until Goalie's challenging the big ones
"yeah, it's hard to see him passing a lot of the really big names"
nope lmao. he only gets more when there's an event/new raid or something.
I think consistent viewership is a better indicator than subs
and then people remember there are actually entertaining streamers on twitch.
Especially with prime subs being a thing
"I think summit and doc are the most consistent with always have like, over 10k. at least from the streamers I follow."
the only D2 streamer I follow is EK.
To give you an idea of gladd vs other channels I follow
Is actually pretty low outside of new hot content
I wouldn't call 2.1k low
"It isnt low, but it's not as high as you would expect with that many subs"
Although twitch viewership feels like it's not a crazy as it was like 2-3 years ago
It's all about Facebook Live
The true future of streamed content
I can watch da games and see aunt debra yell about the deep state all in one convenient place
Quality
"On one monitor, I have xQc. The other, a top 10 list as to how Trump has saved the economy. Yep, I'm a Facebook *gamer*"
Hahaha fucking xQc I remember his overwatch days
Also eventually Gladd will be number 1 if only because mixer will have poached everyone else
"Wait, will the seasonal mod changes remove the forsaken and other year 2 mods?"
dont touch my hive mods damn
"It won’t remove, but I think what they’re going for is season of dawn armor will use undying, dawn, and next season"
"Hive mods can go on opulence gear currently correct? If the changes are retroactive it should mean you can use opulence mods on drifter, opulence, and undying/shadow keep I think"
I'm 5 double kills away from MT :blob:
"i need more stacks in the other team, makes life so much easier"
Didn't they say that it was retroactive to all armor?
Drifter armor is probably worth grabbing now
Since it can use fallen and hive
"Keep a set of drifter, a set of forsaken, a set of dawn, and you’re good until the season after next"
"Drifter for fallen/hive, forsaken for taken/fallen, dawn for GoS and next season stuff"
so.... ummmm..... are there any other good fusion rifles besides telesto?
Loaded Question!!
erentil in pvp slaps
im trying to get loaded question
Jötunn
The Wizened Rebuke
I used Zealot's Reward (the GoS fusion) quite a bit to get the medals for Randy's
Erentil
"Overall, high-impacts are the nicest for raw killing since they only need 4 bolts and are really consistent."
"Firmly Planted makes them crazy, though Tap the Trigger, High-Impact Reserves, and Under Pressure do work too"
The obelisk fusion can be farmed if you quickly need a nice one
"omg last double kill is literally the worst, idk maybe 4 matches and I cant get"
finally https://prnt.sc/r22sk8
"Freelance playlist, use what’s comfortable"
Or group up if the matchmade teammates aren't cutting it for you
"Even if I fail I guess the triumph part isnt going away, or it will?"
It won’t
yeah that stays don't worry
So if you like you can wait until next season
I’ve had the reset for Hush since it was introduced and just never bothered with bows but it’s still sitting there
Meanwhile I've had the opposite
"nice lost one, got weasel in the second"
pretty much sure i got ddos'ed
why does drifter look like bear grylls
"“Fallen on the horizon, better drink my own piss”"
grills? gryllys?
i give up
How fast does Sonic run
Is this a bit or an actual question?
This actually is a good discussion:
https://redd.it/f3tl21
Why was stuff like Gjallarhorn so dominant in D1 but rocket launchers as a whole so underused in D2 anyway?
ugh yeah. I miss using RLs.
"D2 rockets are weak because of Gjallarhorn for the most part, and they hit them harder because of auto-reloads"
yeah auto reload hit GL and RL super hard
"But even without those, surely they can be of more use"
"GL is still good though, but I felt at launch they were kinda weak"
Did D1 have auto reload?
from anything I mean
I think what happened is power creep
Seems like Cozmo is monitoring that discussion as well
yea that's good that Bungo is aware
Everything else got slowly more powerful and Bungie has gjallarptsd
i don't think there was any autoreloading in d1
"other than black spindle, best we had was triple tap and triple double"
Did Gjallarhorn have more than one shot in the tube at a time?
i think? i might be forgetting
I don't think so with exception of maybe some very niche exotics
Gjallarhorn had 2 shots IIRC
Maybe a blanket 25% buff in damage for rockets would be good
Something like how they fixed Xenophage
Do all rockets in D2 have only one shot?
D1 you could have 2-3 correct?
I think Truth has more?
pretty sure in d1 you could have tripod **and** clown cartridge
so up to 5 lol
gat dang
see that would instantly change the boss meta back
"Bad Juju and some weapon exotics had perks that reloaded them automatically or would allow for shots to return to the magazine for free.The First Curse (intended to be the opposite of TLW, so a slow firing hard hitting HC) would reload upon first precision kill of the magazine. Pretty sure old Sealed Ahamkara Grasps would do some auto reloading shit too on Hunters"
"I think that was a single rocket that could roll tripod plus CC, and I think CC was a chance to roll more in the mag"
Was there a Huckleberry equivalent?
Most common was 4 in the mag with some magazine shenanigans
oh btw Oath I hope your test went well!
"No, not really. Ace of Spades would load a new bullet into the mag for every precision shot"
"oh that's a great Ace perk, wish we had that now"
"Yeah, about that...... I think I passed but I butchered things badly"
"^
i felt that"
"eh it's all good, Dynamics is a tough subject!"
You'll get 'em next time
Fucking instantaneous centre of motion
that's all I'm gonna say
Oh! almost forgot
All of the King's Fall raid weapons had an auto-loading perk
"It was called Cocoon, and I think it was D1's version of Auto Loading Holster"
"and yeah it looks like you could roll CC and tripod on a single rocket, the issue I think was it capped it out to 4 rockets (very well may have been 5)"
"Touch of Malice would be devastating in the current sandbox, and actually less so when we had auto-reloading haha"
plus it's such a cool looking gun too
ToM is nutty
"lol considering tuesday I get 120 glory, I actually need 1980 for MT https://prnt.sc/r2h5v3"
freaking 6 glory
I've sure I'll lose like 3 matches in a row now
Wait for Tuesday
"Just wait, play the matches Tuesday lol"
yeah I think you're right
but I'm greedy lol
https://prnt.sc/r2i0mj
now i have to go throught that same process
I would recommend momentum control and get it started
Hahaha congrats
just got my rare bounty for izanagi's burden
the ascent....
this is going to be a long night.......
Niceeee
i got trinity ghoul as a weekly bounty completion
like how you do 8 bounties and it gives you a reward
and it gave me trinity ghoul
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/786378449280034550/D56F5D37F63A6652E20399C79E0D307D90DA9E7F/
i got error code guitar and the next thing i know drifter is pissed at me for leaving a match
We need to get another group together and get our Anarchys this weekend
why not just get the group we usually have
I didn't mean change it up
aye
I'll get my anarchy and call it a good week :blob:
the crucible grenade launcher AND anarchy?
"if you get it, you will be one lucky man"
he'll have the wombo combo
wonbo
combo
"eventually I'll get anarchy, I'm not giving up"
i'm pretty sure everyone will
.....hopefully
I checked my collections other day and I'm missing malfeasence (beginning of the quest) and chaperone (last quest step) plus anarchy and tarrabah.
I'm also missing tarrabah
isnt that CoS gun?
"I cant complain tho, I've like 8 clears on each of them"
The only exotic weapons I'm missing are the 3 from the raids
don't give up mugetsu
let us hope we dont have a faulty fireteam next time we do CoS
https://prnt.sc/r2j1ao
"you know what, I might be able to join for CoS or something tonight. Last time @Thawxtem asked me, I thought I'd have a lot of stuff I need to do but actually I might be free tonight"
"we still have the semi final boss save, we should try get it done before reset"
so I'm down to Sherpa CoS if necessary
that fire team was BADDD
and hmmmmm
if you guys needed someone else I'm sure Trissin and I could step in for some shenanigans
Maybe I'll try pick up the boss CP for crown
"we cant blame the guy that much tbh, I feel bad for him"
we could try something interesting @Oathbreaker
we could indeed
I do not know the strat for Galhran 2 man so
oh neither do I lol
but to be honest I don't think it's too hard
probably not
I think boss damage is gonna be the hardest part
especially as we'll be lacking debuffs
yeah that's the real big thing
plus no auto reload
"hive armaments mods for the win, a bunch of thralls during damage phase so almost infinite heavy"
but you gotta have blessing for that
what's the hive armaments mod /s
so only one of us can have that
"true, other maybe tractor and izanagis?"
divinity
then you get the debuff and special ammo is easy to get
"no, I don't think tractor/div is worth in a team fewer than 4 people"
double Izi maybe?
but idk if it's enough total damage
bubble and tether can be a bit tricky but maybe
thats 30% + 30% dmg buff with saint 14 helmet to blind thralls
how good is python
it's good
idk if they fixed one-two punch x2
I still don't have a clear on CoS
i've only attempted it once
after couple runs we'll get things down and complete it super fast
Need moar CoS for Tarrabah
im pretty sure we could 5-man the 1st encounter
"Possibly, the challenge for that encounter is that only two people have blessing at a time"
thats actually pretty easy
until the ogres spawn
"Hmm, the new operator in R6 is named ""Oryx"""
"and they are talking about ""Darkness"""
Wish I had his muscles though ngl
I believe in you Ron
I did think about going to the gym this week so I'm halfway there already
"And Oryx is a dope ass name, I’d name a dog Oryx if I didn’t name all my pets after Capcom characters"
wait you named all your animals after capcom characters?
is one of em named chun li?
"Naw, asshole cat named Wesker, hyperactive dog named Rush, had another small dark grey cat named Ada but she had health issues"
Thinking Nero for the next dog
like nero cesaer?
Unless I can convince my wife to name it Lord Shaxx. And naw Nero from DMC
She’d consider Cayde
Name the dog Cayde-7
that'd be dope
"if i get a dog, i will be naming it saint"
for...... religous reasons
"Get two dogs, Saint and Osiris"
twins
if i get twins i will
only if it is a Russian and Egyptian
"Get a Russian blue cat and a savana cat, Saint and Osiris @RonInDune do you agree?"
"in my defense, I'm allergic to cats...."
but not dogs...
don't know why
Caucasian Shepherd (russian)
ooooh that sounds cool
Pharaoh Hound
Blue German Shepard and regular German Shepard
https://www.russiandog.net/caucasian-shepherd-for-sale
i like the name of this website
they so cute
:blob:
that is a big damn dog
puppies are adorable
1600 dollars..... not bad
These are not large dogs but these are XXL dogs
fits saint-14 pretty well
from what i understand they are gentle giants until provoked
but they look so cute!!
"“No, you can’t have another treat Saint” *dog fucking destroys you with a headbutt*"
"In my experience big dogs are super chill unless they have reason not to be, and little dogs have hairpin triggers"
i hate chihuahuas
for obvious reason
no off switch
EVER
"That and people will train big dogs not to fuck shit up, and let little dogs do whatever because they don’t do as much damage"
when i was a little kid my parents had a 120lbs warlock Doberman pincher
i love big dogs
Pomeranians are satan incarnate
warlock doberman
doberman
was it named osiris?
regular doberman but on the high end of height and weight. his name was Prince
that's a good name for a big dog
he sounds awesome!
"with his pack (our family) he was super chill and gentle, but god help you if you were planning to do us injury"
big doge
bit scary
he certainly looked big and scary
and his bark scared the shit out of anyone who knocked on our front door
...what exactly am I reading?
Dogs that could be named Saint and Osiris
There is also an lfg post for tomorrow for the anarchy grind
Is this the usual team?
"coolio. That means we're still familiar with each other, and our relative roles"
I will be cheering all of you on

"Doing a sherpa run of SOTP with some irl friends, need +1"
anybody interested?
sure why not
"oh sweet, ty"
"hold on, aren't you doing 3x boss tomorrow?"
that means you will be missing out on loot
because i don't think you can get loot more than once
"wait, yeah you right"
lol I dont mind if you back out rn
i'm cool with that
"btw AssCreed Odyssey Gold edition is on sale for 69% off, so this is a great time to get it"
https://www.greenmangaming.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey-gold-pc/
this is a very nice™️ deal
"pretty sure that's what i got it for on the steam holiday sale aha. so, definitely grab it if you're interested in the game."
I always keep an eye out for the rockpapershotgun games sale list
"for sure. once I saw that price on steam I was just like ""add to cart"" lol."
that was a massive discount lol
did you try the AssCreed VR escape room at any time?
It was ... interesting
I don't do VR lol.
It was 4 of us solving puzzles and climbing across sheer walls to escape a pyramid and find a piece of the apple of eden

Where’s my Sonic VR game?
Why can’t I recreate my Sonic fanfictions in VR?
Isn’t VR supposed to be the future
"The Taken King thirsts for your Lig.... wait, wrong game."
almost butchered the quote
Like Sonic butchered my realistic expectations for hedgehogs
Someone edit in the bird mask
And give Knuckles the OEM
@Crizum i can see that

A frame perfect infinite hammer glitch ^^
frame perfect?
thats tough
People aren't completely certain yet
its prolly doable
bu yknow...
"""frame perfect"""
thats near impossible
Needs macros to be consistent maybe
I WOULD ASSUME
caps lock...
do you think ambitious assassin on a rocket launcher would make it have more ammo?
In what way?
It does give 2 rockets in the mag
Doesn't increase reserves though iirc
Im out having dinner with friends so I'm probably gonna be late. I'll update y'all in 10-15 minutes tops
Sorry guys I'll probably get home in 15-20 minutes. If you get a 6th feel free to replace me
I'm down to wait
"Thanks, traffic its pretty good I'll get in 10 minutes"
I'll join in a few minutes
Im launching the game rn
Uh power just cut out

Who is gonna stream to Twitcharoo
So I can watch
and hope someone gets anarchy :hehehe:
I tried
rob are you that bored?
I am at work lol
I literally watch videos all day... hell... @Jeremy how long was your stream earlier?
you boss allows that
"Yes lol, I still do my job... I am just able to use one of my monitors to stream content lol"
6 hours
And in that time... I was promoted to moderator and paid the whole time :lulslide:

Anarchy!
Finally!!!
Who?
Thawx
Grats
"It's actually a blessed run, I got it first kill, thawx got it second. We have channeled some great evil for this luck"
:BirdronixBell: :BirdronixBell: :BirdronixBell: :BirdronixBell: :BirdronixBell: :BirdronixBell: :BirdronixBell:
3/3 anarchy's :whew:
Your RNG for the next 5 years will be *terrible*
OH NOOOOOO
who got the third?
Lol so now I’ll start weekly crown runs
Crown x3 for Tarrabah
but hear me out I got gauntlets :reeeee:
quadruple down
:monkaScan:
Tomorrow?
ummmmm... im free
im free after like 2pm
central
"I already got Tarrabah, though. I'd be willing to help if it meant farming first encounter SoS sometime also for Calus emote"
if y'all end up bedding someone pine MW in drunk but able to sj. in lolol
*She speaks the language of the gods*
dry season starts tomorrow fam lmaooo
Y'all are welcome
I did a dance for y'all
:lul3d:
is that english?
Goal getting that liver workout in
that shit be real hard
*malaka*
okay ncm I'm going to slssp hahaha
*lisssssp*
@Thawxtem I would be down to farm Calus emote too
what emote?
Still need to do spite at least once haha
Yep I never did it too
I still need to farm whisper heroic for the catalyst and the ship. All chests give only 10% progress
@Saint 14's loyal follower the toast emote. With the calus chair
the swirly swirly
whys is the campaign sooooo boring
Which campaign?
all of them
I'm wounded
I love the campaigns
"okay, they have *plot* but aside from that i don't like doing it three times over"
I have played the campaigns so many times 🤣
I don't think anybody can match Ari in terms of campaign completions - except Matos probably
How many characters did you delete again?
Only 5 🤷‍♂️
1052 hours?
im a little gamer boy
1052 isn't entirely accurate
"@Destiny [PC] lf2m to help me complete whisper heroic for the catalyst and the ship. I already did the chests and oracles, just need to complete it."
"""oh my cotton socks"""
i love cayde
Isn't that like an Australian saying or something?
Bless your cotton socks
"@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 if you're not doing it right this second, I'm getting lunch, but I can help afterward"
"""oh my cotton socks did you not just hear what i said"""
"@Thawxtem sure, take your time"
is there a way to get ornaments from last season?
Time machine?
But otherwise wait for them to come back in eververse
that makes me mad....
"@Thawxtem Looks like someone dropped from the run tonight, will you be around?"
"Pizza's just coming in for dinner now, I should be around. I could always use new Hunter CoS armor"
didnt we only like 5 people last time?
"Nice, I forget if we still have the checkpoint"
who's new?
Curious to try new exotic...
"I think so, in boss room phase 1"
"yeah, we completed the jump puzzle"
"Peronix was new but he dropped and uh, I think maybe Nick is new this time?"
Either way with a full group it should be smooth
just so you know i still haven't completed CoS
CoS isn't really all that bad honestly
"yeah, mugetsu and I are completely new"
"You're cool. We know you try hard, and if you don't, we know where your clan is..."
It's Crota's End but with actual mechanics behind it except the mechanics aren't all that complicated
You know how sometimes a person who seems to be working against you is actually worse than not having the person?
Still sorry
It's not your fault
lol @Thawxtem
that raid made me want to rip my hair out
*munch munch*
plus we'll be using Anarchy so
Dibs!
3 of them
i need tarrabah
"Only need one, and ideally it's a well warlock or bubble titan"
Good luck y'all!
what raid does acrius do well in @LW Mugetsu
@AhRealMonsters you working tonight? Do we need to stream?
you told me last night and it went in one ear and out the other
leviathan in the vault encounter
i thought i might be able to use it tonight
"Quick question about something I noticed with Izanagi's: Sometimes when I hold reload after firing, it reloads and then reloads again to Honed Edge. Other times I hold reload after firing and it goes straight to 4x Honed Edge. Is there something I'm missing?"
Timing and practice
Happens inside and out of wells
If you don't hold reload quick enough it does that
Could I hold reload while firing?
as soon as i pull the trigger i'm already press reload
increase reload speed mods or luna well make the window to press reload shorter. but its all about timing and practice. a tip is fire and without release RMB you press R
"""without release RMB?"""
"yeah, like you're scoped in when you shoot right? keep mouse right button pressed and imediately press reload"
ah. wasn't sure what RMB stood for
"yea the quick reload timing can be a bit hard to get it down, I practiced quite a bit in the tribute hall to get it down"
it's handy to get one extra shot during the GoS boss damage phase for instance
I feel like I could do more damage in most of the boss fights if I could get the timing down better. Everyone else typically gets 1-2 more shots in than me
"yeah, do what I did and practice for a bit on the ogre in the tributehall, or on Greg"
Greg? Another Randall or something?
Greg the ogre is the lost sector boss on Titan
who is Randall?
Cargo Bay 3
the Vandal
Randall the Vandal
from destiny 1
that randall
I don’t recommend izanagi for CoS. Actually Thawx if you have Loaded Question a decent loadout is Outbreak/Loaded Question/Spike Grenades
Or MT/Recluse/Grenades
It was just a question about Izanagi in general
you can't one phase Gahlran with Outbreak though
But Thawx is a CoS veteran
what if we all run outbreak?
Among the first in the world
Most of the time I had Jottun for the wizards
All outbreaks actually wrecked but they nerfed auto-reload so not anymore
auto reload?
like store away and bam nsta reload?
Luna boots nerf
Lunafaction boots and rally barricades used to auto-reload while you were shooting
*dramatic inhale*
"So you never needed to stop and load, which lead to a bunch of stuff getting nerfed"
I think both Thawterm and ****kikker were part of this group
I remember Trissin backstabbing and betraying the clan by leaving us to try and get world's first
Pre-nerf trench barrel on ikelos with Luna well
He was never forgiven since

did yall ever play BF1?
I played bf4 but not bf1
that's a nice jacket!
dannng
anyways
in BF1
there was a shotgun
that shot buckshot....
but it had a duckbilled brake on  the end of the barrel
wtf is this naming convention
Did Dice forget to count at some point
Hey Ron
and it made the gun 1 shot from inside 45 meteres
Go check out Kingdom Hearts
imagine getting killed by a shotgun from halfway across the map
.....with buckshot
it was literally hell
*heh heh heh...*
like OEM and recluse
it sucked balls
@Crizum this seems alright?
Ron you little shit
there's WAY more
not as bad as final fantasy
I just scrolled past all that lol
Hey I liked FF Spirits Within
FF isn’t as bad
Though I'm told that's not in any of the games
FF caused so many branching off games it was insane
like yall ever hear of Swords and mana
or any of the Mana franchise?
thats a series that branches off of FF 1 for the NES
Yeah but at least those are all mostly stand alone and not the same storyline
Which is the best one?
none of the FF franchise has a storyline!!
FF I mean
7
XIV
1 and 2
7 is the one with the remake right?
the latest
More than one have had a remake
It’s also the reason Nomura is a thing so I’ll never forgive it
I got spoiled on one of its twists
BF5 is a trash game
How come?
i regret being apart of the beta and alpha
"Anyway, everyone will have a different favorite FF game"
its a trash heap @RonInDune
dang that's too bad
it was good off of release
but they ruined it with the battle royale
I remember seeing the trailer and thought it looked cool lol
"i mean don't get me wrong, the graphics are surreal"
wait there's a battlefield battle royale
Still waiting on Ubisoft to give us an open world asscreed battle royale
but the playerbase is kind of people who would jump around with shot guns and sniper rifles
Because they haven’t killed AC enough
AC doesnt deserve a battle royale
it deserves more then that
"any game that stoops to that low, is off their rocker"
I just want Ubi to bring back Prince of Persia
It didn’t deserve to become a Grand Theft Witcher clone
and Bungo to bring back Oni
Had to put my favorite FFVII meme up
"i still cant stop watching Mugetsu's post of ""whats inside a titans mind"""
thats like top tier shitposting
and i love it
"Okay, where does the Titans and Crayola come from, anyway?"
keeps popping up
I know the memes about Marines and crayons
It implies that titans are not the smartest of guardians.
"Which is kinda funny, Caydes dead and Zavala isn’t so"
cayde was just foolish
and dont talk crap about my cayde.....
I mean I liked Cayde but honestly dude was dumb as fuck
he was a comedian
what do you expect
they should make it so cabal can be picked as guardians
i would play as a space rhino any day
I don’t think anyone actually likes warlocks in canon
"We all love Shaxx, and Saint"
I like Osiris
Who honestly likes Osiris? Dude got sent away for yelling at people
Osiris is bae
*cries in floaty noises*
osiris is an asshole
"i mean, Saint is also an idiot"
Yes but
Saint says nice things to me
so does ikora
and cayde
and osiris
and the awoken hunter lady
and kadi
and uh tyra
"Osiris is just all “Guardian, I shit my pants *again*, go find me some time lost toilet paper as I can’t use charmin”"
"crizum, i feel like you identify as a titan"
Naw I like hunters too
but you dont like cayde.....
I actually identify as a contrarian asshole
that makes sense
"No I love Cayde he’s just dumb, and I love him for it"
I only really dislike Osiris and even that’s minor
My favorite character was Variks
It just hurts because I was trying to do my first Destiny cosplay as Osiris...
"Osiris wouldn’t concern himself with my opinion, and neither should you"
how be tha raid progress?
Final encounter
30th try
and we didnt defeat it
51 tries I would say
you can get it next time!
Got close
wrong; we Will get it next time
im  sad
we got so far to lose it all
"But in the end, It doesn't even matter"
Really? Linkin Park
i dunno
Just need to be safer on punching the deception when crystals are around
when you need to complete 10 encounters on leviathan
for acrius...
that's and uh-oh moment
Finally got Graviton Lance catalyst
"Nice, gl to get all the passive kills"
It needs 1k cosmology kills if I remember properly
"Oh god, @Crizum I found the source for that Bugs Bunny Byte"
That is a terrifying statement out of context
It’s so terrifying
*The whole YouTube channel*
"So I went on a 6 game winstreak in comp last night, and I feel like 100 recovery is way better than 100 resilience or 100 discipline"
You can clearly tell how much faster the regen is
recov > damn near everything else
Trust me
yup I'm finding that out now
100 Res does basically nothing for TTK
"100 mobility, wormhusk and void battery  = profit"
also feels like devour is not as handy in PvP as it is in PvE
Devour most definitely isn't unless you can confidently out duel opponents one after another
"if you can't, then the other two trees are far better"
yeah that's the hard part
It can be absolutely monstrous though when set up for the chain
what's a good gun to outduel last word or lunas in the mid range?
Last word or Lunas
I'm wondering if I should use a solar smg
basically
oh damn lol
SMGs don't have a competitive TTK except for when you hit all headshots
that's kinda hard
autos?
don't bother with autos lol
only two semi competitive ones are suros when fully spun up or monte with x5 perk
I liked Suros cause I just finished with the catalyst but I'm worried comp will not be nice to me
Pulses or Hand Cannons are kinda the way right now primary wise
scouts are finnicky but doable
any sidearms that match up?
I'm going revoker or randy's in primary
Sidearms are kinda ass compared to hand cannons
sure more damage but so much closer in terms of range
You *can* make them work
the issue is when you try to duel a HC it won't have the same range
"I've been trying to headshot supers with revoker, I think it should one shot"
still haven't gotten one
"Hc are pretty op if you think they're kinda a revolver, their range should be shorter imo. But if you change them there is no other option for pvp"
"also, ancient gospel with rapid hit slaps pretty hard"
90rpms one shot supers now so yeah Revoker one shots to the head
If they nerf HC range even more then I'm done basically lol
Is the Sturm drang combo any good? I'm wondering the overcharged sturm shot can two tap
it can
Plus it has good range
with one kill on Drang I think
It has okay range. It should hit cap?
But it fires slowly af
it's the drang kill that's hard
The issue is without the Drang bullet you have a mediocre at best 110
"Basically you want a 150, 140 if you really land your shots"
You want to use something fun yet stupid? 110 HC with Eriana's Vow and Lucky Pants
so just keep switching back and forth
If you get the fast swap down it's actually a stupid TTK
But yeah right now
it's 150 or nothing in HC territory
I mean you're good enought to pull that off but I don't think I am
Arguments could be made for certain rolls on other archetypes but 150s are the most forgiving
"also it's funny, my matches after getting to comp fabled have been less sweaty than regular crucible"
"I'm pretty low, around 2400 but my matches are more even now and not full of mindbenders spare rations"
they will be
eventually
sadly that's what's the most competitive these days for solo players
"I only kinda like momentum control, super fast ttk"
Momentum Control could have been so good
"yup, momentum control actually made me a better player"
Like that Halo Reach sniper only gamemode
but then they included heavy and allowed stupid things to 1hko
"Jade rabbit, *shakes fists*"
Yeah don't mind me just gonna sit in the back of the map and somehow farm out a Seventh Column
"lol, I have to get that catalyst down so might as well do it"
they should do a sniper only mode
I've to get several crucible only catalysts
though it was easier in reach because there was only one sniper I suppose
Jade Rabbit/Vigilance WIng/ Suros
these are the easier ones
I have MIDA to finish
There's also MIDA but that's only for the best players
Yeah I won't ever get to legend
Oath is the only person I know who's on Legend
Yeah lemme go get 200 kills on Mida for ***OUTLAW***
Rover too
best perk in the game
oh I didn't know that
On a gun that already has ***max reload***
Someone was lazy at Bungie HQ
they should give MIDA swashbuckler or master of arms
or maybe feeding frenzy
wait no that's useless
Master of arms would make it so strong
now that it procs on headshots only it's more balanced
MIDA won't get a rework honestly
yea probably
there's too many guns now
We've a ton of weapons but honestly like 10 of them are solid options
Most are just meme or bad weapons
especially in the case of Crucible
give new guns better perk pools
"because right now, most guns have shit perk pools and bad stats"
"For pve too, they work on the easiest things but well anything work for those activities"
so why the fuck would I use them
sturm and drang in any gamemode claps
So does Bugs Bunny
does it? :thonk:
it looks like the grinch
"No, that’s Bugs Bunny"
I am the Vergil to your Dante on the journey of nightmares @Peronix

IS USING THE ARBALEST A META OR SUM SHIT?
For the Komodo
grinding for komodo
its disgusting
people are still doing that?
I think people are trying to finish up the quests now that the season is ending
you still keep them
after season
wait...people don't crank it out within the first 3 days of the season so they don't have to play pvp again?
ye but folks want the title
i think its just a new meta
imagine playing pvp this late in a season. could not be me.
"bruh, i swear if these cucks dont put away their fucking arbalest im literally going whip out my oem"
its either arbalest or vigilance
Its noobs doing komodo quest
i feel that
is arbalest a random engram drop?
it was part of a quest few seasons ago
actually not a quest just something we could buy from a vendor
"with one shot from martyr, i got 5 kills"
thats nuts

that's a galaxy brain take right there
they brought peace to the pve player's mindset.
haha reddit will become a dumpster on fire as soon trials is back
"10 minutes into trials: why im matched against unbrokens, nerf LoW, nerf hhsn, omg why ppl only use meta weapons, and go on"
"Im such a failure, tried to complete 3 catalysts just to abandon all of them"
"polaris lance, darci and acrius nah I'm never doing them"
lol yeah reddit gonna be real toxic next season.
the uplay app never connecting to steam so i can get helix credits...love that.
I did buy the 50% xp and drachmae boost right at the start but I think that was directly through uplay
it worked the other day.
maybe i will try directly through the app.
i just want my warrior sets lol.
"Uplay has always been a nightmare for me, I had a ton of old credits and forgot my password, when I went to reset it they just created a new account and maybe credited me half the stuff I had"
lol yeah same I have an old account with all my Prince of Persia games
guess i'll try later. it's so dumb tho haha.
"for the fighting lion catalyst, is it just any enemies?"
"I got it while grinding for mountaintop, but the shuro chi method works very well too"
im grinding for mountaintop
and this is infuriating
"it is, sadly"
are we still doing CoS
Imagine we build the empyrean foundation and we unlock d2’s version of a battle royale
I assume so @Saint 14's loyal follower
that would be horrible
hah the uplay store finally connected.
"@Destiny [PC] two open spots for the final encounter in crown, anyone available to help?"
Where are you @Thawxtem
"Just finished dinner, coming on"
"Kk, so one slot haha"
"im cooking dinner right now, so gimme like i dunno, 10 minites?"
Where ya at @Kimarais/Nick
Waiting on you @Saint 14's loyal follower
https://prnt.sc/r3u8i4
greatest gun in all of Destiny 1 and 2
Congrats! But also I hate you 🙃
Thawx got his in his 2nd run
"missing chaperone, malfeasance and anarchy now"
I need to get Tarrabah before Ron gets Anarchy
Yeah but Sar also got 1k on his 1st or second
never
Anarchy you say
"Nay, Ron and I are tied by fate"
"yeah 1k was in my first ""run"""
now that THawx has it I'll get it ASAP
:((( everything takes me at least 20 runs to get
"I say ""run""because I only killed riven 3 times and got it"
I'm over 30 in Scourge so
honestly I guess 20 isn't really that bad. There are others out there who have it a lot worse than I do
I'll get anarchy after the reset
I need to just grind out this stupid raid until I get it
There was recent post on twitter of a guy getting Anarchy in his 107th run or something like that
!raid
he got it and uninstalled the game lol
And congrats to those completing crown for the first time!
"Seems like it took a hot minute to get down but it's definitely one of the more chaotic encounters, so nice job!"
NO SHADE RIGHT
don't forget to redeem your crimson days emblem

Data leak for next season. New character in the works...
that's actually disgusting
why does it look like ikora
What do you mean? It's the new Warlock character
alright I'm going to try to get 200 jade rabbit kills in momentum control before reset
should be easy
"That's risky, bungo might break the game again and rollback it"
eh there's no way it happens again
what can possibly go wrong?
Thought the exactly same thing last reset lol
yeah but lighting never strikes the same spot thrice
unless you're Thor I suppose
"But you might be right, there is no patch today"
"Oof, if Bungie did have to rollback, Ron would be pretty *Jaded*"
"Better safe than sorry, I just gonna troll destiny sub for the next hour and a half"
"If you want to see a real salt mine, check out the r/Wolcen subreddit"
"One rough launch, next thing you know, there's a post claiming that the developers have breached ethics"
I couldn't play for more than 15 minutes but Wolcen sure did look pretty
I'll start playing once it's working again
I'll check out
"I've been playing offline, but I think  Online is fixed"
oh I should give it a go then
"Can't wait for trials, sub will be so fun"
I created my character and played like 15 minutes
I might finally have to git gud if trials comes back
I can imagine Oath as a dril instructor yelling at us to train
"What if, and I might be crazy for saying this, Trials uses the same rules as Momentum Control"
I guess they will add a really good ritual weapon to make us play trials
Also peronix do the character models look a bit off to you in Wolcen? Like all the women's legs are like 90% of their body
"Oh yeah, the women are all leg in Wolcen"
"That wouldn't be too bad, I like how momentum control forces you to not rely on any crutches"
"It makes sense from an isometric point of view, I guess, but it looks so wrong when viewed at any other angle"
I guess the devs like long legs
Look at those *legs*
I saw that thumbs up trissin 😉
Cant stop staring at the very short torso tho
That's why it looks so wrong
Also they all wear like 8 inch stilleto heels which must be very uncomfortable to trek in craggy mountains with
It's a shame because the game looks so bloody good
Much better than PoE or even Diablo
"I like it a lot, though it does have its own share of problems (female models, bugs, progression loss, additive skills)."
"Nothing that can't be fixed, though"
progression loss??
"If you were to visit the subreddit, however, you'd think the devs are the worst devs in the world"
that's pretty bad
aw
"I've never heard of the studio before, are they AAA?"
"There was a server issue that caused people to lose campaign progression. Fixed now, though, and those people got their progress back"
Then what is there to complain about?
"No, they're an indie studio with, like, 50 people"
daaaaaang
that does not look like an indie game
"For progression loss, nothing to complain about anymore, fortunately"
"The development timeline is pretty interesting to read about. Apparently, it started as a completely different game on Kickstarter. A couple years later, the devs decided to scratch everything and make Wolcen. Then spent the next few years developing it."
"It's filled with bugs, typos, and vice versa, but my guess is that they ran out of Kickstarter funds and needed the launch cash"
"there's a good game there, so I'm sure they can pull it off"
"On another note, have y’all seen the new remake of Ed Edd n Eddy?"
https://youtu.be/jQWZjVploT8
It’s pretty good
*nope*
*25¢*
Are we raiding tonight?
You know there’s an actual sequel
https://youtube.com/watch?v=6kPLMZ-kv_I
I remember we said something about a run but I honestly don't remember exactly
"Perfect, I always wanted my nightmares in music form"
"I remember talking about reset, but I don't remember anything about raiding tonight."
I could do a raid tonight if people want to.
Sadbrains. Lol
That works then we go for anarchy later in the week
yea Anarchy tomorrow maybe?
@Destiny [PC] ^crown run lfg for those interested
I'll join tomorrow for scourge runs lol.
Got the boss down pretty good now honestly
We need to know when Mugetsu can run scourge for the sparrow part lol
I just hate that raid😂
tfw 3am :feelsbad:
The really sad thing about sotp is I got anarchy before I got a decent threat level
too many bad times with CoS. ruined it for me unfortunately. but I like scourge.
"Scourge first encounter makes my life miserable it always berserker at 2, deposit at 4 fml"
We should do a sotp with all celestial nighthawk hunters
And Ron always get map
Ayyyy hahaha I think every time I've done scourge with Ron he's been our guide on map!
And he's good at it!!
Sar gonna be running that 100 mobi pvp loadout for orbs
"It's every orb, so annoying"
Warlock glide that shit
As hunter I cant even skate with the orb
"Maybe I'll join for sotp some time, if you guys want to speed things up you should try learning how to dupe the orbs"
Ron's team 1 first pick up
There's a small learning curve but it literally cuts encounter times in half
How is it done?
You need to die right before you trigger the animation where you slam the orb into the socket
"You hold deposit, and right when the ring is full you need to die"
"Kind of like how you launch raid banners super high in the air, but with depositing orbs instead"
I like how they tried to fix PoH dupe and made it in a way that you can't screw up anymore
Like they made it easier? How?
wait how'd they manage that?
If you screw up it doesn't deposit so you don't lose the orb lol
Oh shit haha
"lol I think I tried poh dupe once, when I was trying to solo flawless but i honestly felt it made the totem encounter much harder"
yeah the PoH dupe is so much easier now
I noticed it deposits super fast since last I did it
||That new cutscene though ||
"before the patch we start to dunk and swap weapons, so any mistake the orb was dunked"
"now it dunks super fast, so you swap weapons and instantly dunk if you screw up you just drop the orb"
Haha damn
10/10
"@Peronix || oh yes, it's pretty cool! ||"
||I was so ready for Zavala to pop out of Rasputin's chamber once again lol||
||Osiris finally read some grimoire cards||
||The EP changes make so much sense now||
"||so like, there is hope for pve players next season. maybe.||"
||Rasputin is the new Trials announcer||
Time for some wacky shenanigans
"||Destiny 2 gets the portal gun, and Rasputin is secretly GLaDOS||"
"||We had a season with Osiris, and it has a season of Rasputin after. If it all holds up that means Uldren next||"
"||hmm, yeah a return to the Dreaming City would be appreciated||"
||I want to see Savathun vore Uldren||
||I feel like we've all (including Mara Sov) abandoned poor Petra||
Hahaha @Peronix ||Becomes a heroic guardian only to get vored 10 minutes after we teach him to be a hero||
Petra knows how much pain last wish caused me so she's okay with me not going back there.
Petra Venj needs your help! Run the updated Last Wish raid to save her!
“What’s updated?” “Oh we added those blasters from the whisper mission every five feet”
"Savathun is so thicc from all that vore, she's got a song based after her"
Don't drop that Savath thun thun
Savathun and Calus are that gross south Florida couple that tries to get young people to go swinging
Calus is probably a very moist boi
Savathûn waits for you
"Yeah, I'd let her vore me"
"I always imagined that, when Hive eat, those plates covering their mouths act like pincers"
"You know what Trissin? Thank you, you've reminded me of a question I had"
Is there such thing as reverse vore?
"Like, vore, but in the style of enemas?"
@Peronix birthing
muting the channel
"Like, if you consume someone through the ass, does that count as vore"
Naw that’s a different fetish
Gaping?
"""The Darkness consumes all"" has a very different meaning now"
Never understood the fancy name
I just call it a drink
"Though I must say I’m impressed, your legend grows @Peronix, just the act of you asking a question has people mute the channel and never read the logs"
The modern-day Boogeyman
"(Also, reverse birthing would probably be what you’re after)"
I wonder how far we could go before Goal nukes the channel
We’re getting pretty close man
"*My name is Icarus, and this is my story*"
Can anybody here read Japanese?
"I mean, I can read hiragana and katakana (letters basically) and some kanji"
But i probably won't be able to actually understand anything that isn't kanji because I don't have a wide vocabulary
I'll try my best though
"Not sure if it's completely Kanji, but here you go

"wait, can't you just google translate this"
Google's translation sounds funky
i thought it was gonna be like an image in which you couldn't like copy paste text
"I've had problems with Google translate in the past, since it ahs trouble with contextual stuff, so I was looking for confirmation"
i put it into google translate
my japanese isn't great
Lol I google translated that too
"but i mean, it seems pretty accurate for the most part"
at least in a literal sense
"except for maybe the line ""squeak"""
There’s a reason localization is a thing
Neon grain sounds awesome though
"i think that's supposed to say something  like end, scream"
or something along those lines
I tried another site and I think the bot is having an existential crisis

You got to interview Yoko Taro?!
"The sequel to Nier: Automata, real life"
Looks like auto generated GPT 2 text
It looks like a cry for help
I should build a bot to auto generate this channel's responses
So much vore
I’m scared
I wonder if robot peronix can outdo human peronix
Are you endorsing a competition?
A bot that plays out a conversation between me and peronix and argues about crucible 24/7
can we download an entire channel's worth of text? I've never touched the Discord API
Add in @LW Mugetsu from the animemes channel please
"“Ron what did you create?!” “An abomination, a masterpiece, a *son*”"
"Are you talking about something like this, @RonInDune? https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/6wskjj/discordchatexporter_command_line_tool_to_save/"

"yea that looks good, I'll keep y'all posted"
Modern-day Frankenstein
"also that's a good semester project idea for my students, everyone's in some discord or the other"
Are you doing the channel as a whole? Or each user and having them converse?
I'll make sure to credit you
Or just Peronix
My legacy grows
all users
I don't think peronix alone has enough responses to generate a cogent output
For a fun side project to your side project batch users together
"For instance, what would a Trissinbear be like?"
What about the Crucible complaints that would come out of Crizumbear?
yeah fuse Oath and Goalie for the ultimate PvPvE showdown

Much better than Google translate
"oh damn, definitely refer to mugetsu for future japanese translations lol"
his japanese is much better than mine
Nope just know where to get things translated
The only language I understand is English
*thank you*
Is that from something in Destiny?
"No, it’s from an album. West of Eden by HMLTD.

It’s a Japanese interlude between songs, and I couldn’t find a translation anywhere"
Ah. Glad I could be of assistance
Ranked up 24 times by handing in Fractaline loool

I haven't really looked too much at my Perfect Paradoxes either so
what's your pvp JQK3?
Crossfire/High Cal/Subsistence/Rampage/Range MW
Or I could use the Hitmark/Light Mag/Demolitionist/Dragonfly one I had before
so this is good?
how good is threat detector btw? does it reliably proc in PvP?
"Apparently its good for close range, Cammy recently posted a video on using it."
I'll take a look ty
Procs at 14m so yeah it's okay
Wouldn't say it's amazing but it's an okay perk really
Pseudo quickdraw at times
that player is a mood.
Do I even need quickdraw if I have Ophidian's aspect equipped at all times
Ophidians mostly covers that front
"It's like Peacekeepers but for all guns, best general purpose warlock PvP exotic imo"
Transversive Steps disagrees with you
"hmm, it's a switch up for me"
being able to reload a gun by sprinting while having faster sprint is so good
but Ophidians are really good
i loved using last word and transversives
"I'd say that Transversives are better for most loadouts, but ophidians can edge it out in some cases"

It's really good XP too
went up 24 ranks in 2 hours worth of pressing my M1 key a whole lot
I'm trying to get to 20 power bonus and these really help
How do you get 7 bounties?
3 specific Perfect Paradox bounties don't count towards the Timelost Bounty cap for some reason

I just watched the ninja clip thing. He comes off as such an insufferable cunt. Like cmon my guy relax.

like really or sarcastically?
He meant it.

We're going to need some thicc stacks of fractaline
I tried really hard to donate fractaline yesterday but it takes like 5 seconds of holding down m1 to donate only a hundred
yeah it's a mess
"I kept buying bounties and donating, cashing in, buying glimmer etc. just so that I don't get bored"
close to 10 billion Fractaline
l m a o
Tbh I think the community can do it
Oh probably
but the step up just doesn't correlate with the previous stages
They were 1 billion increments unless I'm wrong
At first I thought it launched on 9/7. But it was 9/9 when destiny launched. So that is out. 😭
Not much more than previous increment. It went from 3 to 6 billions
It would be much more fun if nobody donated anything and bungo would keep saying level x completed
"This is just to build hype, next season is ready for a long time and specially in this buy $10 seasons they can't afford make all community pissed off saying: you failed, nobody will have savior and bye bye trials"
if it doesn't look like the community will reach that number then they will lower it.
bc at this point they're just withholding a title from people lol.
"I think they've gotta be lookin at numbers and figuring out the right number to complete it next week and have time for the season transition content, because people have been hoarding"
Honestly it’s all the investors faults
They know how much people have hoarded away and adjusted accordingly
I always knew Warren Buffet was to blame for all this mess
holy hell @Sarsante - 76561197967628966
Think you'll get to 1000 this season?
Maybe @RonInDune  but I'm not doing many bounties anymore.
Also I started to save weekly bounties for next season lol

Literally says Fortnite is his source of pride
didn't he build his careeer in Halo?
Unfortunately
I have no idea. I never even heard of him until Fortnite
"He had some success in Halo, but not a lot at all."
Did he make a stopover in Overwatch town like Tim?
He stopped over in a few games IIRC
Gamers are wild
Reddit continues to impress (read: horrify) me everyday
gamers™️ are bad
imagine being that pathetic.
"There’s gamers, then there’s Gamers"
Check the review bombing that goes in to almost any game with 🏳️‍🌈 characters
unfortunately some of the worst people online tend to be the Gamers™️ type
i can imagine. it's sad.
"If you did a Venn diagram of Gamers™️ and members of the alt-right, you’d end up with one circle"
"pretty much, yeah"
gamergate never ended to these people
Yeah but it doesn’t help that a bunch of gaming journalists continue to be hot trash
(Guess which side they’re actually on though)
Y’all ready for the outrage about Persona 5 Royal?
There already is
They removed homophobic scene = censorship to these people
"Didn’t remove, altered some text"
i never kept up with anything about that game haha.
"I platinumed vanilla P5, put like 200 or so hours in to it, it’s a minor scene that barely registered to me but upset some people so if the change lets more people enjoy the whole game as opposed to being soured by the bad taste of it that’s great"
Why won’t they let Joker date Yusuke
Best boi
❤️ Matthew Mercer
a minor thing triggering people is pretty common these days lol.
but yeah if whatever they changed just gets it out of any shit a small portion of people got upset over then that's definitely better.
https://youtube.com/watch?v=3AE1GXzSPhM @thegoaliebear one of the scenes in question
"so...what exactly were people upset with there? like, i read into that more as harassment than anything."
I believe it’s because the only gay characters in the game are perceived as sexual harassers
huh that's actually a legit point
wait do people want that harassment back in?
Gamers™️ do. They claim the altering of said scene is C E N S O R S H I P
that's .... dumb
The game does also have a drag queen in it
"i mean, i can see why people would be upset that the only gay characters were portrayed that way. if there are other characters who act like that, then it would be okay i think. but if those are the only characters who are involved in it then yeah i see how that could be problematic."
Naw one of the main first story beats is ||defeating the sexual predator school teacher who fantasizes about one of the party members being his literal fuckdoll||
"ATLUS is a weird company. They’ve insinuated being open about LGBT representation, yet they show insensitivity towards the subject"
ATLUS in general is weird about almost everything from the top to the bottom
Plus I think Royal is head by a woman? As opposed to the guy that did 3/4/5
"i think, if you can't handle a topic in the right way or are unsure about how to do it, then it's best to just not do it lol."
I thought you still play as Joker?
The woman is just a new character
"You do, all the additional content though"
I mean the director
"Oh, ok"
"I can kinda agree goal, but with tons of media people need to stumble or step over the line to see where that line is. Everyone is just hyper tuned to aggression it seems"
"i get that; people jump down other people's throats way too quickly, which doesn't help lol."
But I can concede that I’m a white guy so I’m not dealing with “still? In 2020? Fuck off” like others are
We live in a society. Gamers are oppressed. We must rise up
"like personally, as someone who identifies as lgbt, i don't consider myself a ""part"" or ""member"" of the community because i have a lot of issues with how people in that community act over a lot of things. and that's from personal experiences with (now no longer) friends."

"Ron, who are you following to see retweets of a vote comic?"
I think you’re hiding something from us

how about never posting it anywhere and never acknowledging it ever again
How about sexy lady calus?
Couldn’t be anymore sexy than regular Calus
That's a good point

@RonInDune thanks for the tip to get raid free chests https://prnt.sc/r4swlb
arrrrrggghhh
congrats but I'm also very mad
@RonInDune these past few days
I've been doing that 3 times a week for like 6 months
"I did 4 chests before reset, got it in the third today"
still have my warlock to get the sweet taken barrier
armaments is the only one I'm missing for now
I only have armaments
and only fallen barrier
though I do have hive/fallen armaments
hive I think I've all of them
Fallen armaments is the only fallen mod I have
missing hive barrier too
if we do a heroic menagerie I think I'm guaranteed to get a hive barrier
we can do it
just checked it from menagerie I'm missing emperor's blaze
yeah if you do Heroic menagerie you'll get it for sure
25% more dmg to solar abilities inside leviathan
*very* useful for celestial hunters
fallen and taken I'm missing a lot https://prnt.sc/r4t1s1
I believe thats all mods I'm missing

is it sad to have a pet rock that is 2 million years old?
that's pretty young for a rock
not for petrified wood
its a baby rock
its like baby nut
"2 million years old, but still a baby... Can it go drinking yet? When can it?"
it can go drinking in about 200 million years
just @ me when it's time for the raid.
aye aye cap'n
Esoterickk's 980NF run with telesto and sword is amazing

"Once per character per week. Each drop has a 5% chance of being Anarchy. There is no bad luck protection, the chance is always 5% and you might never roll it. Tarrabah is the same in Crown of Sorrows.
1k Voices has a 10% chance to drop from a chest at the end."
this is fun
i love mindlessly waiting for a chance to get a gun that i might never use
how do you guys do this
They upped Anarchy to 10%
regardless

do you guys deal with this bullshit

got it https://prnt.sc/r4xhw9
slowly getting there
Lol did Thawx get another?
@Kimarais/Nick and I got another
"yep, one drop on each run"
Sar got that good rng streak going on
"but @LW Mugetsu said ""i can gurantee i am going to get another one"""
Higher the season pass level higher the drop rates
before raid even started
I did say that
nah it started after I got MT
oh got an annoying crucible weapon? lets make it rain
When the new season hits let’s team up for pvp
"we can, I just suck at it"
Did someone
say
PvP? 👀
Look man I’d play some pvp with you but you’re gonna have to master the deadlift
I feel it worked nicely my strat this season. I let high rank people climb then easily did komodo
Oh I mastered the blueberry deadlift back in tail end of Black Armory lmao
(I’m actually not super trash I just don’t play enough to stay consistent)
I get that lol. Same for me these days
Kinda trying to return to form after that long break from D2
"Im bad, I dislike so I dont play it"
I used to be so much better
Looking back and watching clips to see the insane shots I used to hit make me sad now lol
one of these days I'll put together a demo reel of sorts of all my old clips
running meta weapons in iron banner is fucked
Ninja should be President tbh
He would change the national currency to V-bucks and moms’ credit cards
He would fight off all the John Wicks
Ninja would make us *truly* live in a society
His Presidency would be the first ever presidency to last a fortyear
This is not a joke
#Ninja2020
New air force one
This is a Ninja presidency Discord now.
"Destiny is dead, Fortnite is eternal"
If he wants he could build Trump's wall really fast
He could even build one between us and Canada
Nationalism would increase under a Ninja presidency
he has such a punchable face
That’s your future president you’re talking about
#NotMyPresident
Punch next president it's not a wise move
"If Ninja was president and was assassinated, would that be a Victory Royale?"
TONY THE TIGER IS OUT
FORTNITE IS IN

I just don’t want to see you descend in to a dark place
"My life has stayed normal since finding Ninja

Sure, I dyed my hair blue in an attempt to look like him. And sometimes I yell at my mom for not cooking enough tendies. 

And I...I like going into the forest, rounding up small animals, and taking them to the shack in order to reenact my own battle royale. So many animals dead becuase of my Victory Royales..."
But my life is fine
Ninja hasn't affected me
"Son, I looked the other way when you took all the tools out of the shed, I thought it was nice that you were building with your hands but it’s gone too far. You’re dabbing after ordering “choccy milk” you’re flossing everywhere but your teeth, you’ve even started skinning people and stealing their clothes, only filling their corpses with poker chips you’ve scratched a V into. 

Look at what you’re doing, come back to us"
***T E N D I E S***
"Dad, you don't understand! I'm only practicing for when I meet Keanu Reeves. Fortnite said I was John Wick--I must listen to Fortnite."

i dont know either @RonInDune
we need an adult
Destiny content drought?
"The blood spilled, the v-bucks spent: it's all for a higher purpose. To reach ascension, I must achieve a victory royale. But sacrifice is required, and not all sacrifice is voluntary.

My methods may seem unorthodox now, Dad, but you just wait. When I become Keanu Reeves and achieve my victory royale, you'll understand!"
mods help us
"Join me, Ron. The forest beckons for us, the animals beg for salvation."
@RonInDune it's just the normal morning fever dream that Peronix causes in this channel
"PeRONix, RONinDune. It was there the whole time"
Staring us in the face
:tateruSurprised:
These animals will serve a higher purpose. Their deaths bring us closer and closer to the true endgame
The endgame?
I don't think anime will help with someone this delusional
You’ve handled cases of chuuni before haven’t you?
"Ninja, grant us eyes."
Not like this
He’s got stage V chuuni
Allow us to become one in your image.
At the point I think an actual exorcism is our only choice
*the power of God and anime compels you*
"I saw Ninja, once. Only once has he graced me with his heavenly figure, his sacred shape. 

He appeared to relay his commands to me. *He chose me.*

To do this, he handed me a book, titled ""Get Good"". Ever since then, I've lived my life according to his will. His every command decides my next step.

And I wouldn't have it any other way."
"""We are born of the *Ninja* , made men by the *Ninja*, undone by the *Ninja*. Our eyes are yet to open. Fear the *Ninja*"""
"Help me open the eyes of this server, @thegoaliebear. Pin the message of Ninja. Only He can save us from eternal doom, AKA PUBG."
I'm gonna add ninja to the list of banned words for the mee6 bot.
"A ban only lasts a lifetime, but Ninja is eternal"
Thank y'all for coming to my TED Talk
Sister Esther is worried about you @Peronix
I love Ninja
He’s my Savior
But thicc anime thighs save lives
I think we have a containment breach
Who needs thicc anime thighs when you have Ninja’s Shifty Shaft?
Did you guys know that Ninja is the primary user of the bird spies that are always watching
"False, that’s propaganda spread by the developers of PUBG"
Oh really?
Are you so sure?
Because I'm not
Why else would Ninja command me to kill so many birds?
*so many birds...*
He only did that to gain your confidence
He didn’t have to gain my confidence—he’s had it since the beginning.
It's all part of his plan
His plan to keep all of the fortnight players virgin's for life
Everything he says is to scare off girls
The girls don’t understand
Ninja’s command must be followed
I've heard of a couple of other false gods saying the same thing
You've been had.
"Every animal skinned, every victory royale achieved, every *shot fired* serves a higher purpose."
He doesn't care and never has
You are just a cog in his machinations
I'm only saying the truth because I want to help you
Think about it
"Mugetsu at his age he’s just experimenting, remember *B A B Y N U T*"

excuse me what the fuck is going on
But @Crizum experimentation like this can lead to darker places if we don't intervene
@Oathbreaker Salvation
Next thing you know he's gonna want us to drink the kool-aid
"I only drink Gfuel, just like Ninja commanded me."
"“It started with Ninja, thought it was just a phase, then came the Pokimane feet worship and I let him slip away, I couldn’t look at him. Last I heard he was mainlining OnlyFans ASMR. If I could take it all back, if only I could have spoken sense in to him. Gods forgive me”"
Your salvation is *madness* Peronix
"Peronix is like the guy that saw Cthulu in a reflection and is trying to warn us all, but it’s gibberish"
Oath...don’t anger Him. Let yourself ascend.
Fuck that
He could end up on ASMR and makeup tutorials
Or worse
His image
I live for his image
I worship his image
*shudder*
I want to *become* one with his image
@thegoaliebear @Trissin plz ban the word ninja ASAP
"We have a code 5 situation, requesting immediate ninja containment before it spreads"
"I sense anger within you, @Crizum. Good. That means you’re winning."
"Use guns, fire, whatever we need to beat it back"
But it's only a game
"May He show mercy to your soul, Mugetsu."
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xzpndHtdl9A
Lol. Right like I still have a soul
How do you think I got 2 Anarchys in 2 weeks
I can't rn.
"Goal, please, you must see the Light"
you stop it
you stop this
RIGHT NOW
:vvCopSwingFast:
YOU WILL SUBMIT
TO THESE BEATINGS
"The Roo’s will convert, soon."
:rooVVV:
if you can
CATCH ME
:rooSlide:
"Ninja doesn’t need to catch. He has no time for silly games. Ninja is an omniscient, omnipotent being; hiding only delays the inevitable."
He only knows what's going on because of his bird drones
so now we have a ninja worshipping cult
It's only peronix
we must exile him
he has lost his mind
he's gone insane
we need to eliminate the *one who speaks*
Obviously somebody needs to take up the mantle of pirate so we can have the age old battle of pirate vs ninja :poker_face:
if this spreads
we
will
We need the help of Mark Watney - Space Pirate
all
fall
Speak for yourself
I can't fall to weak stuff like he's talking about
Rapture
Tribulation
I've seen the Star Wars Christmas Special ninja is nothing compared to that
alright guys
hear me out
what if
WHAT IF
https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/f6yhym/swords/
you check this post out
and agree with me
"tl;dr
add a swords gamemode to pvp"
Ninja doesn’t use swords
is amazing
WE MUST REMOVE THIS HERETIC
@Kimarais/Nick @AhRealMonsters
But historically real ninjas used swords and any other weapon they could
sticks
rocks
Peronix do I have to put you in timeout again?
Yes you do
Please
For all of us
we must stop him
strip of his rights
do not let him toy with our minds
"Such a malleable thing, the mind. No wonder you all have been corrupted by the world.

Ninja offers an escape from reality, a chance at ascension."
You speak lies
the only escape is in saints godly voice
he and him alone shall set me free
I am his pigeon
oh holy one
he has changed me
join me
Oh boy I'm gunna have to put everyone in time out aren't i
are you telling me you don't believe in saints holy touch?
"You can’t censor ideologies, Ari. 

*Join us. Feel our loving embrace*"
Now think about what you've done
we have done nothing
all we did was spread his love
become one of his pigeons
become one with Him
Censorship: the coward’s claim to power
they wish to silence those who speak truth
"for the truth that is, is the truth that others believe to be lies"
alright folks I am building a bot based on your responses in this channel going back to 26-11-2017  00:32:00
I promise to not use this for nefarious purposes and the code will be available on MIT Licenses as soon as I figure out how to remove the passwords
I’m glad you waited for the good word of Ninja to be told before you started your work
"Speak now, or forever hold your peace"
This server hasn’t known peace for a while
I wonder what happened
anime
"anime is indeed corrupting the minds of our youths, we need to bring back prohibition"
Screw you guys
all who watch anime are to be guillotined immediately
"excluding me, of course"
Saint does not agree with that punishment
Don't blame anime.
the guillotine does not discriminate
but it does when the word of saint is involved
Now Ron is joining in on the cult like talk
the saints are usually first againt the wall when the revolution comes
Saint approves
Slow mode?
Why are you encouraging the authoritarian admins to censor us even more?!
I bow to the authorities
this is yalls fault.
you did this to yourself.
I said I'd put everyone in timeout
I'm also not in the mood to deal with it lmao.
"like, I'll just clear the entire channel at this point if it continues."
What even happened here?
a bunch of unnecessary shit tbh lmao.
"I know we use this as a general chat a lot of the time, but that doesn't mean it's a free pass to do a whole bunch of shitposting"
:derp:  See you all in 15 :derp:
What weapons are left that never got anti-barrier/overload/etc. mods? Heavies?
"Just heavies I think? They’ll probably redistribute so you’ll see weapons that previously had anti-barrier now be overcharge etc etc. Also, yeah that all seems fair I’ll dial the bs way back sorry y’all"
I'm surprised they've haven't done unstoppable on heavys yet
It definitely would make sense
I don't think they want to have people run out of heavy ammo while using an unstoppable mod
"in some activities like ones with rally banners, sure, it's fine, but in ones like the 980NF you're risking having no ammo"
Plus aside from Izanagi most people use exotics in the heavy slot and exotics can’t have those mods unless it’s intrinsic
I think unstoppable makes a lot of sense on like lmgs
I mean sure but again
you're gambling with the heavy ammo economy
Bungo doesn't like that and rightfully so
"It does, maybe they’ll throw it as just a perk of the weapon type? Like machine guns get stagger, linear fusion get anti-barrier and the like?"
Would open up the mod system for primary and energy weapons a bit
"imagine you have an unstoppable Ogre running at you in 980 Savathun's, and you just burned the last of your ammo on boss DPS trying to burn the boss down real fucking quick, and you get wiped by that Ogre"
how angry would you be
That would be great but would like require a massive rework in how the weapon systems work if that makes sense
"Yeah, it does. They have shown they aren’t against entire system changes though, but I bet they are wary after Season of Bugs"
Lot of backend data that would need to be changed for every single weapon for every class that gets an intrinsic perk like that.
"It could be done, but that opens them up to a metric fuckton of bugs"
Feels like it wouldn’t be too different from mods though? Just a mod that we don’t see and can’t place
"Heavy only weapons are like, non-breach GL, machine guns, linear fusion rifles (not counting Arbalest) and swords right?"
"See that's one way to make rocket launchers good again, make them have some intrinsic perk"
Oh yeah those are things. Yeah but I kinda don’t want them to have a forced niche you know?
"“This is useful because we said so, not because it’s competitive”"
"Yeah, but most weapons have a built in archetype specific intrinsic perk. For example, 150 Hand Cannons give a mobility buff when equipped (Excluding Luna's and Not Forgotten) due to the Lightweight frame. This is true for all Lightweight frames"
So Bungie would have to find a way to make the new intrinsic weapon class perk and old intrinsic archetype class perk play nice together in the developer sandbox
"not impossible, but it's not just a simple ""add it on and ship it to live servers"" addition"
yeah that's why having traction + lightweight frames can basically boost you beyond  100 mobility
