thegoaliebear [SEP] i'm always on the fence about using them. but if you do they are a huge improvement over the old ones. they are also a good way to see what your loadout looks like on the battlefield.
====================
Trissin [SEP] I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but I did see people who had a hard time getting it. I would suggest going to the shop and buying the correct item. You won't have to do anything else.
====================
Trissin [SEP] and that's it
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] I'm gonna have to wait for a few hours for it to load. I can only log in now from my phone or steam. I'm on Xbox Live and I'm watching the stream for the new raid.
====================
Crizum [SEP] Oh, and if you really want to be a god, you should try to kill your teammates before they do, and when they die, you can't just revive them with a revive. You have to kill them and revive them. That's the most important part. It's also the reason I don't play as a god anymore.
====================
Oathbreaker [SEP] Like the guy who built the ruins of a kingdom on the moon?
====================
RonInDune [SEP] I mean, the gold is worth the money, right?
====================
Sarsante - 76561197967628966 [SEP] I love that it's a title
====================
Sarsante - 76561197967628966 [SEP] @Trissin I think the new raid should be a bit more challenging
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] theres a rumor that the epicenter of the war chest is near a crypt. is it in the crypt?
====================
Sarsante - 76561197967628966 [SEP] I'll try to do that tonight. I'll also have a lot of stuff to do for the upcoming raid
====================
Trissin [SEP] !lfg create
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] so i'm not gonna bother to get the new raid. i'll just wait until i'm able to do the lw and then play around with the new loot. that being said, i think it's a good raid. i like the fact that it's a crucible mode where you get to do things like kill people or take them down with guns that don't have a great range and range is definitely something to like about it.
====================
Crizum [SEP] Oh damn. That's the most recent I can find.
====================
Crizum [SEP] Ah, that makes sense
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] i don't know if i should post it on steam or not, but it was just a reminder of the times when I'm not playing lol.
====================
Crizum [SEP] No more Crizum, just me
====================
Arixama [SEP] i think that's the one i'd say...
====================
Trissin [SEP] oh wow
====================
Trissin [SEP] 
====================
Arixama [SEP] I'm not sure if that's true but I think it's also been a long time since we've had a good one man raid
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] it's fine.
====================
Arixama [SEP] @here we're gonna try to get the first encounter up and running as well as the boss fight. i'm also working on the first encounter of the fractaline raid, but we're also getting into the heart of the fractaline zone.
====================
Arixama [SEP] I think it's just a new option on the app, so it's not as big of a deal
====================
Buttkikker [SEP] what time is best?
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] but also not a huge fan of the idea of the raid being a one man show. i think people should just keep the party going by having the leader and the rest of the raid stay alive. so people can go back to the basics of the raid and not have to worry about how many people are dead in the raid.
====================
Trissin [SEP] I thought they were done with it?
====================
Sarsante - 76561197967628966 [SEP] lol
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] @here i will be around for the next hour. can anyone help me out with this? i need to get a new class and I need to do all the raids.
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @Trissin we're in the store so we're looking to do some of the work on the game right now and we're gonna need to start the quest in the quest log. so if you're interested in helping out with the quest, you can do the quest in the quest log and then log in to the game to start the quest. and if you have any questions about the quest, feel free to ask in the #raid channel on the steam group. also we have a raid that we will be doing on the next raid day so if you're interested, we can do that too. if you have any questions about that, we can get you a server to join us in the raid room
====================
Arixama [SEP] @here we have the <|startoftext|>Trissin [SEP] just need to get the <|startoftext|>Trissin [SEP] the new raid
====================
Trissin [SEP] or just let me know if you need help
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] what time is best for you?
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] nah. i can't log in to my steam right now, and i'll probably get back to playing eventually. but i think it's cool that you can't log in right now and still play the game.
====================
Trissin [SEP] I love when they do it on the raid
====================
Sarsante - 76561197967628966 [SEP] I did that last night too
====================
RonInDune [SEP] I'm not sure if this is a new raid, or if they just moved it to a different server, but it seems like the PVP players are playing more and more in the PVP realm.
====================
Trissin [SEP] I've been playing a lot of PvP. I love the fact that there are so many different ways to play the game. I've never really played a single game that offered me the same amount of opportunities to do so. But I don't think there are any other games that offer that kind of opportunity.
<|startoftext|>Trissin [SEP] I think there's also a lot of people who have never played a game before who have never played PvP before. I think it's a huge part of the appeal. The fact that it's so different from the other games that exist in the same genre is also a huge part of the appeal.
====================
Trissin [SEP] oh nooo
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] i don't think he'll be playing for a while. i think he wants to get into the realm of the realm again. but he can't help himself. i'm not sure if that means he'll be able to do raids like the one he did last time, or if he'll be able to do raids like the one he did this time, but I'm sure it'll be a lot more fun. i've been playing in that realm a lot lately. so it'll be interesting to see what the meta is going to be like. and i think a lot of people will probably just be playing the game for the content, not the game itself. but the content will definitely be good. i just don't think that's the right approach to the game. i've been playing for the content. i don't think people are playing the game for the content anymore. they're playing the game to enjoy the game. and that's a good thing. but the content isn't the core of the game. so what is the core of the game?
====================
<|startoftext|>Arixama [SEP] I've been playing like 30 hours a day on my PC, and have about 12 hours a day of PVE on PC. I'll probably be playing around 10-ish hours a day on PC, and maybe a few hours a day on console.


Also, I've been playing the crucible beta for like a month now, and haven't played for like a month and a half on PC, so I'm pretty much the only one who hasn't played it on PC. I'm looking forward to that.


I think it's a really cool idea. People who are playing on PC can just go to steam and play against each other on the same account, and the people who are playing on console can do the same thing. It's very easy to get into, and it's not a huge barrier to entry for new players, so I think it's a good idea.


I think the console players will probably have to do a bit more work to get the most out of it, but I don't think it's too bad. I think the biggest thing is that it's a game that has a ton of customization options, and that's something that's going to
====================
Arixama [SEP] I think it's a good idea to do a raid where you can play as the boss and get some kills, and it's a great way to get a feel for the game mechanics
====================
Trissin [SEP] ^^
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] @here I'll probably start playing around with the raid eventually. but until then, I'm just gonna be grinding for the new weapons.
====================
Trissin [SEP] I'm in the same boat as you guys are
====================
Trissin [SEP] I'm pretty sure I'm at least at the "master" rank
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] i just got a new character with no friends, and no desire to spend the time and money to improve my gear. it's so sad :(.
====================
Trissin [SEP] !lfg create
====================
<|startoftext|>thegoaliebear [SEP] I know there's some people who still play it on ps4 and it still doesn't have the special effects of the PC version. but if you're playing the PC version on ps4, you get the same effects and the same maps as before, so it's not a huge difference. but I've never played the PC version on pc. and if you're playing it on pc, it's just the maps and the mode. it's the same thing. the PC version is just the maps and the mode. so it's like a different game. and I haven't played it on pc for a while. so I don't know if that's a big deal for those who still play it. but for the people who have played it on pc, it's a huge difference. so I'm not sure if it's worth it for them. but for the people who don't play it on pc, it's a huge difference. so for me, it's not a big deal. but for the people who haven't played it on pc, it's a huge difference. so I don't know if it's worth it for them. but for the people who haven't played it
====================
Oathbreaker [SEP] I'll be on for the next hour or so
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] hahaha yeah that's why i never see them in the raids lol.
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] it's a good idea. they have a different type of raid this time around so they'll need a better system for the players to manage their stuff.
====================
Arixama [SEP] and that is a big difference
====================
Trissin [SEP] !lfg create
====================
Trissin [SEP] !lfg create
====================
Oathbreaker [SEP] I was thinking something like:
====================
Sarsante - 76561197967628966 [SEP] !raid
====================
Arixama [SEP] !raid
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] @Trissin i think we should do a raid tomorrow. not sure if it'll be a good time though because we have a big event tomorrow night and tomorrow morning. it will be a huge event!
====================
Arixama [SEP] I am able to complete a D2 raid with 2 people
====================
Trissin [SEP] that's what i mean
====================
Trissin [SEP] I'll be on around 6 EST for the second week of the raid
====================
Trissin [SEP] And they're not as popular as the raid
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] so that makes 7 now. but if it does it will be for the rift and not the main game.
====================
Trissin [SEP] @here I need to get the tuesday time roll. I don't have it yet so I need to do the quest for it. Can anyone help me out?

http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/N/175850
<|startoftext|>Trissin [SEP] @here I'm gonna try to get it on Tuesday, it'll probably be the same time I did the last raid.
====================
Trissin [SEP] we also need to get the first wave of the prismatic emblem
====================
Arixama [SEP] I think the meta has shifted a lot towards those who can't drop out of games and grind out the bounties
====================
Buttkikker [SEP] @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Trissin @Buttkikker [SEP] I mean it's cool that they are still working on the single player mode
====================
Trissin [SEP] I can definitely do the raid if people want to!
====================
Trissin [SEP] oh I see
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] hahaha. i will probably do it soon. but i will probably not be doing it on the way home.
====================
RonInDune [SEP] Alright, I think I'll let that rest for now. I'll definitely see if I can find someone who wants to do some of the raids. Just to be sure.
====================
Buttkikker [SEP] i think we should probably wait till after the season starts
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] i don't have to pay for it. i can just play it on steam. and i have my account there, so i can get the extra loot from it.
====================
Trissin [SEP] !lfg create
====================
Trissin [SEP] I think we'll get to the part where the update is more important
====================
Arixama [SEP] I think they're going to make it harder to do it with the new raid
====================
Trissin [SEP] @Trissin I'm going to try and get my first gift from the shop. I'm looking for the first exotic weapon in the game.
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] is anyone down for a raid tonight? it's a bit late but we're looking to get a bit more organized with the team.
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] @here I'll get my first cp in about a month and it's going to be a very difficult one to solo it. but I'm looking forward to it.
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] they should be able to pick and choose from their friends list for the raid. i don't see how that is going to be a problem. but it is a nice thing to have when you have friends who are willing to go along for the ride.
====================
Trissin [SEP] !lfg create
====================
Trissin [SEP] I think it's also good to have a place to run guild matches. I've never done anything like that, and I don't think I will be doing it again.
====================
Oathbreaker [SEP] Is that the one from the fabled raid?
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] i want to see a pvp match made with this stuff. it will be fun.
====================
Trissin [SEP] hahaha
====================
Buttkikker [SEP] i did a lot of that in the raid
====================
Trissin [SEP] @Oathbreaker @Trissin you guys can try it with a different character and no one will be able to use the same class
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] they just did the raid for the final time. and it's not like they have the resources to do it again. so they've just dropped the game. but they're also dropping support for the game.
====================
Trissin [SEP] @here we can start. would be happy to run the raid when we're done
====================
Crizum [SEP] If they could get the level cap to 1, that would be great, but right now they can't
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] i can make a new character and use the skill to do the same thing. so it's a very cool system."
<|startoftext|>Arixama [SEP] ?
====================
Buttkikker [SEP] @Trissin can anyone do a run with me on the Forsaken side?
====================
Trissin [SEP] I like the idea of being able to do something that people can actually do
====================
Oathbreaker [SEP] It was cool, but I feel like I should be able to solo that too
====================
thegoaliebear [SEP] yup. now i need to start farming wtf [1/17/2016 8:58:03 PM] thegoaliebear [SEP] i need to get to the gear that is required for the new expansion."
====================
Trissin [SEP] if you don't want to do that, I can do that for you
====================
Trissin [SEP] @Trissin !lfg create
====================
Trissin [SEP] or ive never even heard of them
====================
LW Mugetsu [SEP] This is the thing. Most of the time I will have a new raid that I can't do because of time constraints. However, if I have the time and the space I can do it. I'll just have to make sure I get the raid in a way that's fun for everyone and not one that's just a waste of time. For example, I'm thinking about getting a new raid or two on the PVP side of things. Maybe even going to the PVE side of things, but it would be nice to have a raid that has a solid core to it. Something that's really fun and exciting to do, but not so overwhelming that people are leaving the game in droves.


<|startoftext|>Trissin [SEP] I'd love to do a raid on the PVP side, but it's just not a priority for me right now. I'm thinking about the game as a whole, not just PVE.
====================
