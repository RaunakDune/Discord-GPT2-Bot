What's the power level recommended?,Arixama,1
I believe the recommended is 370,Trissin,1
"btw, what time works well fo ryou @TRex1780 ?",Trissin,1
What time are you thinking?,Arixama,1
"Oof. I didn't realize light level had to be 370, I only 348 right now. Maybe I should hold off for the time being",TRex1780,1
ah ok I think that would be wise,Trissin,1
sorry @TRex1780 !,Trissin,1
also i'm good anytime after 5 @Arixama,Trissin,1
"Nope, that's on me! Gotta get to grinding those weekly milestones",TRex1780,1

Any idea about how long it would run?,Arixama,1
"lmk if you need help with any of them @TRex1780 , and running normal leviathan + EOW are also fast ways to get your light up",Trissin,1
"@Arixama it's hard to guess for now, I would say it depends on our group",Trissin,1
we should be able to get to the boss fight I think,Trissin,1
however the boss may take a while,Trissin,1
really just depends on communication and teamwork !,Trissin,1
"I'm not sure exactly when I'll be home, but I'd definitely be down to try it.",Arixama,1

im max 375 id be up for it,Arixama,1
Yeah hope it's short!,RonInDune,1
"I'm max 366,  a little low but I would do my absolute best",TheCnC,1
I think we can try it out!,Trissin,1
ads will be kinda tough,Trissin,1
but we should definitely give it a try',Trissin,1
Max 368. If I get a few drops I might be able to bring it up to 370,Oathbreaker,1
That being said I'm interested,Oathbreaker,1
sweet!,Trissin,1
"so we're 5 then, is that correct?",Trissin,1
sounds like it,Arixama,1
Logging in now,Oathbreaker,1
looks like we need one more for spire @PC,Trissin,1
380 is required right?,MrGommyBoy,1
recommended is 370,Trissin,1
i think 365+ should be ok',Trissin,1
Oh okay,MrGommyBoy,1
ads might be a bit tough,Trissin,1
but it should be alright,Trissin,1
I'm 378,MrGommyBoy,1
oh yeah thats fine,Trissin,1
And ive never run it before though,MrGommyBoy,1

"ok cool I'll com,e then",MrGommyBoy,1

"yes, we will be starting soon",Trissin,1
sorry im just in a strike rn,Trissin,1
thats chill.,Arixama,1
all good,MrGommyBoy,1
That was so good. I'm starting to like this game! /s,RonInDune,1
ive got the full levi set with all the mods lol,MrGommyBoy,1
"ayyy, nice!!",Trissin,1
alright I am in the voice channel,Trissin,1
go ahead and join up on trissin!,Trissin,1
will be in in a few,Arixama,1
"Was thinking about the run last night, we should try the arcstrider strat since we already have so many hunters",Trissin,1
"Everybody just needs a Raiden Flux, and during dmg phase we just slam his feet",Trissin,1
i could also pop in as my hunter,Arixama,1
haha that would make 6 arcstriders!,Trissin,1
I think it's worth a shot,Trissin,1
That could work. Maybe 1 Titan with melting point,Masrim,1
Definitely could. Gonna do a run of EoW today and maybe regular Leviathan just to get the Power Level increases and not be a potato when it comes to the enemies,Oathbreaker,1
Lol I never did a raid before so I thought last night was the regular one,Masrim,1
"Really? You did well then last night. Spire of Stars is the second raid lair that was released for D2. Leviathan is the base raid, Eater of Worlds is the other raid lair.",Oathbreaker,1
Eater of Worlds is my preferred raid just because it's a good balance between length and challenge. I find it to be the most fun.,Oathbreaker,1
@Trissin did you guys finish Spire? first time we cleared we did 5 arcstriders + 1 melting point. second and third time we had 3 arcstriders + 3 coils w/ Luna rifts. proved to be very clean two phases.,thegoaliebear,1
"We didn't finish Spire. I had to go last night, was past 1 AM my time lol. We're gonna give it another go sometime soon",Oathbreaker,1
oh okay aha. well for your first clear I would definitely recommend 5 or all arcstriders.,thegoaliebear,1
were you guys sending one person up to destroy the ships or were you sending two? we only send one and it makes things massively easier.,thegoaliebear,1
"We would send 2. It was working out fine imo, just we had trouble killing the gladiators and that was what wasted the most time for us",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah we might need to equip some rocket launchers,Masrim,1
if your arcstriders have shotguns (EP shotty or Zenith are best) those will take them down very quick. or jump back and use a coil shot. one coil and then some primary shots take care of them nicely.,thegoaliebear,1
only rocket launcher you would need is coil😜,thegoaliebear,1
Wardcliff?,Masrim,1
I got that at 378 or 379 so I'm good to go haha,Masrim,1
I just need a better helmet. Hoping I can snag one from Leviathan or EoW,Oathbreaker,1
I need to learn to jump better lol,Masrim,1
yeah wardcliff is all you need for the boss aha. does crazy damage and will take the gladiators down very quick.,thegoaliebear,1
We doing SoS again today?,MrGommyBoy,1
"I'd like to, depends on everybody else",Trissin,1
okay lol i can go for a bit,MrGommyBoy,1
I won't be on until around 530,Arixama,1
no worries,Trissin,1
you wanna come to one i joined?,MrGommyBoy,1
You need anything body?,Masrim,1
Another not anything lol,Masrim,1
I'd like to do it again. Hit 371 so I'm not a potato anymore with gear.,Oathbreaker,1
"Any chance anyone would be interested in a leviathan or EoW run tomorrow morning? Still a bit new with both, but wanting to get them down better.",TRex1780,1
Anyone want to do some Valor grinding (QP/Mayhem) for MoT?,Oathbreaker,1
How hard is the rat kings crew quest? Has everyone here completed it?,RonInDune,1
"pretty easy, you just need people to do it with",Arixama,1
the toughest part is doing the nightfall,Arixama,1
"Hmm, if anyone has  the time, it'd be cool to finish it",RonInDune,1
oh actually I still need to finish that as well,Trissin,1
I haven't yet. Would be willing to grind it with you,Masrim,1
"i believe you can only do it with people who either have the rat king, or they are on the same step of the quest",Trissin,1
"Ohh, so first some patrols",RonInDune,1
for me,RonInDune,1
then public events then crucible then nightfall,RonInDune,1
seems like it,Trissin,1
i dont actually remember tho,Trissin,1
I cheated and googled it,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
I was going around the edz and trying to shoot rats,RonInDune,1
I'm at the part where you have to do strikes with clan mates,Masrim,1
that's apparently the last step,RonInDune,1
if you guys need somebody to help you all get on the same step i can hop in quick,Arixama,1
do we have to be on the same level? not sure,RonInDune,1
oh yeah that'd be awesome,RonInDune,1
Then get to work haha,Masrim,1
i'm online,RonInDune,1
that was awkward,RonInDune,1
@Trissin did you need to get to a certain step?,Arixama,1
nono im good thanks!,Trissin,1
one more public event for me,RonInDune,1
Sorry. I'm out walking the dog right now lol.  Will be on later,Masrim,1
"so my friends and I are running through EOW, one person is new and has never done it before",Trissin,1
we need one more,Trissin,1
_(warning: really cancerous group)_,Trissin,1

jokingly,Trissin,1
"Like normal asshole cancerous or elitist ""we know everything you're terribad GTFO"" cancerous?",TheCnC,1
^,TheCnC,1
nah they're not really assholes they just fuck around a lot,Trissin,1
eow should be quick but it will probably take a bit longer,Trissin,1
because of,Trissin,1
chaos,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
also the conversation goes to some,Trissin,1
very interesting places,Trissin,1
they're not assholes but they do fool around,Trissin,1
anybody interested? lol,Trissin,1
@PC,Trissin,1
I want to but I need to wait a little to play.  Just got back from walk and wife is looking at me the way vandals who are just out of range of you watch you,Masrim,1
lmaooo,Trissin,1
how long?,Trissin,1
Like 30 minutes at least,Masrim,1
She should go to bed by then haha,Masrim,1
The third step in rats king is the crucible right?,RonInDune,1
ah... we were planning on starting a bit earlier @Masrim,Trissin,1
sorry!!!!,Trissin,1
No worries. I was going to do some rat King of red is still on when I am,Masrim,1
Is anybody good at trials?,Trissin,1
I am terrible,Trissin,1
but i wanna get better,Trissin,1
"I just got access to them, so you can guess...",RonInDune,1
i havent played since release,Arixama,1
Oh @Arixama I figured out why I couldnt complete rat kings,RonInDune,1
Apparantly we either have to be on the same quest step or one of us has to equip the rat kings weapon,RonInDune,1
which step are you on now,Masrim,1
The crucible one,RonInDune,1
#3,RonInDune,1
thats kind of what i figured after the second match not giving it to you,Arixama,1
Mayhem Valor grinding anyone?,Oathbreaker,1
Yo anyone up for some heroic mars missions? I having a heck of a time completing the nascent dawn 2 quest. Keep dying at the very last stage.,RonInDune,1
"lets go knock it out, let me log on",Masrim,1
yay!,RonInDune,1
estimated wait time to log in (after they kicked me out) is 76 minutes?!?!?,Masrim,1
???,Trissin,1
blizzard says its a busy day,Masrim,1
"sunday at 11:30pm est, real busy time  lol",Masrim,1
I think it's the free weekend,RonInDune,1
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,Trissin,1
how does that affect it?,Masrim,1
Trillions of people logging in,RonInDune,1
"down to 9 minutes now, was a quick 76 minutes lol",Masrim,1
but why did they kick me out,Masrim,1
I think when you moved zones they couldn't find an empty server to slot you in,RonInDune,1
"See:
https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/06/how-destiny-2-works/",RonInDune,1
"it said I had to restart and update blizzard, I was going to a lost secor",Masrim,1
so there is only ever 8 other people playing with you?,Masrim,1
"Yup, plus your fireteam",RonInDune,1
never noticed that before,Masrim,1
"ALso that's why during the escalation events in Mars, all other enemies in the maps almost disappear",RonInDune,1
that is a pretty good read,Masrim,1
explains why wacking shit happens in strikes sometimes,Masrim,1
Rockpapershotgun's The MEchanic series of articles is fascinating,RonInDune,1
Yup yup,RonInDune,1
Back to grinding this Lance,Masrim,1
Good luck,RonInDune,1
No luck needed. Just boredom and thralls,Masrim,1
Lol,Masrim,1
anybody want to help me run through the acrius arms dealer strike?,Arixama,1
Sure. Give me 2 minutes,Masrim,1
"I'm light level 357, is that too low?",RonInDune,1
recommended is 300,Arixama,1
Oh I'm on my way then,RonInDune,1
I'm ready when you want,RonInDune,1
basically a nightfall with solar singe and equipment locked,Arixama,1
got booted again saying I have to restart destiny,Masrim,1
"OK, finally got all 3 levels on each character, taking a break until tomorrow unless someone wants to do leviathon or something (never done it yet)",Masrim,1
nice!! I wouldn't mind running/teaching leviathan whenever people would like,Trissin,1
"I'm at 349 light and need to raid more often to get through this grind, so I'd be interested in leviathan or EoW as long as life schedule lines up",TRex1780,1
"yeah! I'd love to help, just lmk when!",Trissin,1
I'd be down to run leviathan again. I gotta get them acrius seals.,Arixama,1
"I'm generally around this whole week from 5 PM EST on except for Tuesday, not sure what everyone else's availability is like",TRex1780,1
Heck yeah I'm down for leviathan as a noobie,RonInDune,1
Evenings are best,RonInDune,1
"looks like we got 5 already, sweet",Trissin,1
does later tonight work (~9:30ish EST) @Masrim @TRex1780 @Arixama @RonInDune,Trissin,1
I started the raid once alone died 10 times before realizing I'm an idiot. It should go a lot better this time round.,RonInDune,1
lol!,Trissin,1
yeah haha,Trissin,1
That is perfect for me.,RonInDune,1
let's see if we can get 1 more too,Trissin,1
That works for me. I generally don't work Monday to Wednesday so I can be up til whenever,Arixama,1
"I actually probably can't start that late, work trainings this week means I'm trying to get to bed a little earlier than the usual. I'll get on other runs though, don't wait for me if you can get 6",TRex1780,1
noo trex! what if we started a bit earlier then?,Trissin,1
"we could try starting between 5-7, whenever works for most people",Trissin,1
I cant make that today but if you guys get 6 you should go for it!,Trissin,1
"I'll be off work roughly 2 1/2 hours from now, so anytime after that",RonInDune,1
"I'd say 730 is probably as late as I can start, maybe 8 if I want to hate myself the next day",TRex1780,1
I'm available at 7:30 EST,RonInDune,1
730 works for me,Masrim,1
"i have a question, for that last raid we went on, how are people supposed to figure all that crap out?",Masrim,1
"So we definitely have me, @RonInDune , and @Masrim. Anyone else available 730 EST?  (10 mins from now) I have a firend outside the clan who might be able to fill a spot if needed",TRex1780,1
How bout @Trissin ?,RonInDune,1
If lizard cannot make it do we have anyone that knows what to do?,Masrim,1
He said he cannot make it until 9ish I think,Masrim,1
Oh dang,RonInDune,1
"I've run a few times, I can talk us through gauntlet, baths, and calus. Dogs could be troublesome, and I don't know the underbelly well enough to use it",TRex1780,1
How good is the official destiny website LFG?,RonInDune,1
"Never tried it, honestly",TRex1780,1
I've run leviathan a few times as well,Arixama,1
Dogs is always troublesome if you don't have someone who knows where to go well,Arixama,1
"That's exactly it for me, I don't know the dogs paths or their damage phase locations that great",TRex1780,1
"I don't know about everyone else, but if availability works better, we could always try this later in the week",TRex1780,1
"That's cool with me, I'm free all nights",RonInDune,1
How hard is Trials of the Nine?,RonInDune,1
"Basically depends on who you get matched against, but generally pretty hard",Arixama,1
Ah well,RonInDune,1
"So I think we're in agreement on holding on the raid. If that's the case, now I have no excuse to not go on my run for the day 😑",TRex1780,1
Good luck running! I swam for an hour and am beat,RonInDune,1
"Shoot, that's a ton of swimming! Haha, thanks bud",TRex1780,1
anyone doing anything?  im bored grinding catalysts,Masrim,1
Most any other evening I would be down for leviathan,TheCnC,1
"Hey guys, im trying to run a friend through the raid with a couple of other friends. Anyone wanna do it? We need 2 more.",NickyDynamite,1
Just leviathan normal,NickyDynamite,1
sure,Masrim,1
You got a time frame?,Arixama,1
I could hop on but I just ordered a pizza,Arixama,1
"Uh we're goin as soon as possible so if you wanna join and just take a break when your pizza comes, that's cool",NickyDynamite,1
sounds good to me,Arixama,1
"I think you can join on me.  We're in another discord, I can invite you",NickyDynamite,1
"oh noooo im so sorry guys, yeah I was busy earlier tonight",Trissin,1
dynamite in game?,Arixama,1
Yep,NickyDynamite,1
I should change my nickname,NickyDynamite,1
"are we good to start at 7:30 EST tomorrow? (and also I think we are looking for one more!)
@Arixama @Masrim @TRex1780 @RonInDune",Trissin,1
Yup Yup,RonInDune,1
@TheCnC said that he'd probably be good to do one,Arixama,1
sweet sweet,Trissin,1
I can''t waot,RonInDune,1
*wait,RonInDune,1
"@Trissin and whoever else, if you guys need one more ill probably be on and would be down to do the raid",Sabre,1
anybody free to quickly help me out with prestige nightfall,Trissin,1
haven't found a way to solo the boss....at least not on warlock,Trissin,1
(im on the boss),Trissin,1
"I'm a warlock at lvl 357, I can join in",RonInDune,1
tyty,Trissin,1
coming hang on,RonInDune,1
much appreciated,Trissin,1
take your time,Trissin,1
btw the modifier is void singe,Trissin,1
Aww crap,RonInDune,1
"haha we got it, ty ron!",Trissin,1
That was quite fun actually,RonInDune,1
Hard as balls though,RonInDune,1
@Trissin I'm good for tonight at 730,TheCnC,1
"awesome, just gotta see if @Arixama @TRex1780 and @Masrim are good with that time",Trissin,1
I should be as well,TRex1780,1
great!,Trissin,1
Definitely good,Arixama,1
I WILL give it one more go  haha,Masrim,1
what,Trissin,1
"wife aggro is getting high though,  essentially I got spotted by a dog and the hounds are about to start howling",Masrim,1
😮,Trissin,1
"haha, just because I have been on here late 3 nights in a row, until 1 or 2am",Masrim,1
is perfect paradox a good shotgun?,Masrim,1
**yes**,Trissin,1
"in my personal opinion, i'd put it in the top 3",Trissin,1
behind only the EP shotgun and tractor cannon,Trissin,1
but tractor is not good for leviathon right?\,Masrim,1
_well_,Trissin,1
that's a bit of a loaded question,Trissin,1
i would say it depends on strategy,Trissin,1
some of the more off-meta strategies use tractor cannon a lot,Trissin,1
if you are doing void everywhere it is good,Masrim,1
yeah exactly,Trissin,1
one strat a lot of people dont know is that the tractor cannon actually works on lanterns in the baths,Trissin,1
That would speed things up tremendously,Masrim,1
"yeah, a voidwalker running top tree can tractor cannon a full set of 3 lanterns and nova bomb it",Trissin,1
immediately destroying a full set,Trissin,1
faster than sunbreaker too,Trissin,1
"also, voidwalker running scatter grenade can literally _delete_ a dog in the gardens",Trissin,1
"tractor cannon, and then scatter grenade its feet",Trissin,1
That is good to know,Masrim,1
"yeah, i got this all from a video by indica",Trissin,1
let me link it,Trissin,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz6stgQ2QmU,Trissin,1
Cool I should watch those today.  I start a new job next week so won't have as much time haha,Masrim,1
ahh gotcha,Trissin,1
raids might have to be a weekend only thing for me,Masrim,1
in the future,Masrim,1
Might have to try to get some EP parties going to get that shotgun,Masrim,1
Is the basilisk any good?,Masrim,1
"@Trissin Turns out I may be a little late to raid time, I may have to pick up someone at 7 and quick drop them off.  Latest I should be would 15-20 minutes late.",TheCnC,1
That's it. You have to bring pizza for everyone,Masrim,1
🍕,RonInDune,1
I'll email it to you,TheCnC,1
Man I haven't had pizza in so long. It's been almost 12 hours.,RonInDune,1
i just got a 50% off coupon from dominoes  yay!  bad thing is there is not one in delivery range to me  😦,Masrim,1
Who wants to try a prestige nf with heavy and arc singe,Masrim,1
Are there any plans to do prestige raid lairs next week?,Bobthedog,1
What kind of light levels do they need?,RonInDune,1
I don't think they've announced that unless I just missed it,Sabre,1
Most likely 385 since SOS is 370,Arixama,1
Would sweet business or wardcliff be better for leviathan tonight?,TheCnC,1
my gut says the biz would be better for inside to rack up the skull count,TheCnC,1
"not sure myself, never made it to the skull section.",Masrim,1
anyone on here use windows 7?,Masrim,1
I have a bunch of Win 7 VMs running,RonInDune,1
through 10?,Masrim,1
"I think sweet business is good for skulls, but wardcliff has a lot of uses in any damage phase throughout the raid",TRex1780,1
that's what I thought.  empowering rift with sweet biz at the end seems like a guaranteed 1 phase lol,TheCnC,1
"Could be! I might be misremembering, but I think if you had prometheus lens, every skull pop counted as a kill, so it put more ammo in the clip, and that was ludicrously good. Definitely doesn't work that way now though",TRex1780,1
I used coldheart last time I did this raid with the rift and it wrecked skulls pretty well so I can only assume biz will be that much better,TheCnC,1
Crimson should do well,Masrim,1
sorry I'm a bit late! just give me a few minutes,Trissin,1
no problem,Arixama,1
I was even on time!,TheCnC,1
No worries!,TRex1780,1
Pizza isn't on me tonight!,TheCnC,1
We've been waiting for hours,Masrim,1
For voidlock should I go top or bottom,Masrim,1
may want to switch it up during the raid,Trissin,1
we'll see,Trissin,1
is @RonInDune here?,Trissin,1
Yessir,RonInDune,1
okay great!,Trissin,1
Dunno if my loadout is potimal,RonInDune,1
ah it's fine,Trissin,1
go ahead and join up on me in orbit @Arixama @RonInDune @Masrim @TRex1780 @TheCnC,Trissin,1
oh wait,Trissin,1
im gettign error code weasel,Trissin,1
every body want to join on me then?,Arixama,1
raid alpha right?,TheCnC,1
Uh I got disconnected,RonInDune,1
What the heck happened,RonInDune,1
I got booted to desktop,RonInDune,1
uh oh,Trissin,1
I'm coming back,RonInDune,1
no worries,Trissin,1
@RonInDune can u join the voice chat in discord?,Trissin,1
Uh hang on,RonInDune,1
Thanks for a great raid guys. It was freaking awesome.,RonInDune,1
"ofc! glad you enjoyed it, I had a great time as well",Trissin,1
"if anybody is interested in doing levi, eow, sos, or even prestige levi can just lmk and I would love to join in!",Trissin,1
dont mind teaching it either,Trissin,1
Wish I could have joined in! Sadly had work. Glad to hear that you guys had a good time,Oathbreaker,1
I'm always down for a good raid,Oathbreaker,1
"@Oathbreaker if you wanna do one some time this week, lmk id be down",Sabre,1
oh hey @Sabre ! sorry we didn't have space for you tonight!!!,Trissin,1
😦,Trissin,1
all good! haha another time,Sabre,1
"thanks again lizard for guiding.. and all others who helped teach, I think I'm an expert now  😉",Masrim,1
"I'll be looking to do some tomorrow for sure. Maybe Friday night after 1pm est once I get off work, and again for sure on Sunday night (5pm est) and monday at any time",Oathbreaker,1
yeah! glad our clan is finally becoming a bit more active haha,Trissin,1
You guys are indeed pretty nice,RonInDune,1
yeah me too. it wasnt super active even just a couple weeks ago.,Arixama,1
"I am actually going out of town for a while starting tomorrow, and I wont be back for a while unfortunately",Trissin,1
Always glad to have a group of people to run things with. Maybe we can get some EP going sometime soon!,Oathbreaker,1
but in that time I think you guys should give eow a shot,Trissin,1
yeah!! ep for sure,Trissin,1
Try guiding us via smoke signals,RonInDune,1
LOL,Trissin,1
hahaha,Trissin,1
"I'm familiar with EoW so yeah, you know what, I could try leading that maybe",Oathbreaker,1
that sounds awesome!,Trissin,1
"definitely ep, I want that shotty!!!",Masrim,1
"THat'd be great! I just started a second character, so all this extra gear will help.",RonInDune,1
ive run eow once,Arixama,1
having 3 chars really speeds up the LL grind,Masrim,1
Last time I led a raid it was D1 lol. Sherpa'd a group going through Wrath of the Machine,Oathbreaker,1
they have to be different classes though,Masrim,1
oh FUN @Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
i loved wrath,Trissin,1
"Yeah I just started the hunter, already got one 361 warlock",RonInDune,1
Vault of Glass was easily my favorite to sherpa,Oathbreaker,1
_areyoukidding_ vog was the worstt,Trissin,1
NOOOOO,Oathbreaker,1
KINGS FALL,Oathbreaker,1
BY MILES,Oathbreaker,1
nah,Trissin,1
crotas end was actually the worst,Trissin,1
SO MANY LITTLE TECHNICAL ERRORS WOULD KILL A RUN,Oathbreaker,1
but just,Trissin,1
atheon,Trissin,1
my first fclear of atheon took,Trissin,1
centuries,Trissin,1
I count the Y1 version of Crota as a strike so...,Oathbreaker,1
LOL,Trissin,1
Atheon was a coordination check in the best of ways,Oathbreaker,1
It wasn't a hard check,Oathbreaker,1
Y1 level 26s could clear it with enough patience,Oathbreaker,1
Get up to like 28 with the old system and that's when it got easy,Oathbreaker,1
Templar was fun and was challenging to a degree,Oathbreaker,1
"King's Fall was fun for sure, but trying to sherpa it was beyond brutal. It forced perfection in the later fights. Warpriest you could make errors and still win. Golgoroth you could make errors but still get the DPS to beat him. Deathsingers was where you hoped you didn't have a Warlock get runner and if you did you wiped. It was also really hard to have to try and coordinate. And then Oryx, good lord Oryx. 20 minutes of mechanic based actions where you only do damage to the boss himself is right at the end. You just had to hope your team could hold it together until the end or you waste a whole bunch of time",Oathbreaker,1
oh my god thats a large paragraph,Trissin,1
hahahah,Trissin,1
I have my dislikes about King's Fall lmfao,Oathbreaker,1
Wrath took the best parts of all the raids and molded them together IMO,Oathbreaker,1
actually I believe someone in here _loved_  running as a warlock in KF,Trissin,1
I mean some Warlock mains did really well,Oathbreaker,1
Just in my experience with PUGs the Warlocks tended to be alt characters,Oathbreaker,1
ah haha,Trissin,1
you know,Trissin,1
this clan was almost gonna be called shoot the shooties right @thegoaliebear,Trissin,1
Oh boy do I ever.,Oathbreaker,1
i still think it should be shoot the shooties,Trissin,1
but yknow,Trissin,1
thats me,Trissin,1
ive only ever run vog and crota,Arixama,1
@Trissin we do not speak of that.,thegoaliebear,1
LOL,Trissin,1
"Ari, you on Xbox?",Oathbreaker,1
For D1?,Oathbreaker,1
no ps4,Arixama,1
Damn. Was gonna offer a few runs of the other raids,Oathbreaker,1
"i'd love to get back into destiny 1 and run through KF and wrath, absolutely",Trissin,1
i was on ps4 as well,Trissin,1
i;ve got it insatalled,Arixama,1
not that excited about vog or crota haha,Trissin,1
got a lock and a titan at 400,Arixama,1
Vog I just had way too many good memories of,Oathbreaker,1
ooooh nice,Trissin,1
ew i have so many bad memories of vog,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
and a level 9 hunter!,Arixama,1
Sure it's got its faults that other raids improve upon,Oathbreaker,1
But I found that it was the one I just kept coming back to,Oathbreaker,1
i thought crotas end was just.. idk,Trissin,1
too simple?,Trissin,1
Time and time again,Oathbreaker,1
Again,Oathbreaker,1
it was a strike in Y1,Oathbreaker,1
hahaha,Trissin,1
I solo'd that shit once,Oathbreaker,1
lmaooooo,Trissin,1
If you can solo a raid,Oathbreaker,1
You're doing something wrong,Oathbreaker,1
@ solo aksis,Trissin,1
Unless you're Gladd or Slayerage,Oathbreaker,1
lolol was about to say,Trissin,1
Okay actually Solo Aksis is really demanding,Oathbreaker,1
yeah,Trissin,1
I still want to try it actually,Oathbreaker,1
im not sure i want to try that,Trissin,1
I don't even know if it's possible anymore,Oathbreaker,1
Key strategies might have been nerfed,Oathbreaker,1
🤔,Trissin,1
who knows,Trissin,1
I'll look into it lol. If I'm feeling particularly insane one night I'll see what I need to do,Oathbreaker,1
hahahha,Trissin,1
also didnt gladd solo oryx?,Trissin,1
i havent even seen that one yet,Trissin,1
still have no idea,Trissin,1
Solo Oryx is no longer possibel,Oathbreaker,1
Possible*,Oathbreaker,1
oh what???,Trissin,1
Used the Sleeper before it's nerf at the start of ROI,Oathbreaker,1
well now im really curious,Trissin,1
"It was a pseudo-nerf, purely because they changed its interaction with Oryx's chest",Oathbreaker,1
So unless you were a GG with Nighthawk somehow getting enough super energy to get 4 supers off the solo isn't possible iirc,Oathbreaker,1
ahhh,Trissin,1
I HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRON,Oathbreaker,1
WRONG*,Oathbreaker,1
Esoterickk did it with Touch of Malice after the SS change,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah im watching gladd rn, he's using touch as well",Trissin,1
and its definitely after roi because he also does aksis later in the video,Trissin,1
Yeah that was the one he does all possible ones back to back to back right?,Oathbreaker,1
yep!!,Trissin,1
That was beyond insane,Oathbreaker,1
gladd isn't human,Trissin,1
No,Oathbreaker,1
Not at all,Oathbreaker,1
And he's about to 2 man EOW wtf,Oathbreaker,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Trissin,1
just gladd things,Trissin,1
makes you wonder what 3rd party assists he is using,Masrim,1
"if anyones up for a NF hit me up, can even do prestige (likely with heavy and arc singe)",Masrim,1
im down for a nf,Trissin,1
Let's make it happen.  I'm just going Flash point atm,Masrim,1
"kk, logging on now",Trissin,1
if anybody else wants in they're free to join,Trissin,1
on my way in,Arixama,1
might be slightly garbage,Arixama,1
go ahead and join up on us,Trissin,1
just doing normal for now,Trissin,1
I love heavy day,Masrim,1
Killed Zahn before we got half way up the elevator,Masrim,1
I wish there were tabs in the vault,Masrim,1
I wish there was any sort of logical organization in the vault.,Arixama,1
True,Masrim,1
I put all my legendary mods and shaders in there and there will be like a line of mods and then some weapons and then more mods,Arixama,1
But you can sort by newest,Masrim,1
Oh I've looked at all the sorting types and they don't seem to make sense for the mods as far as I can tell,Arixama,1
They don't. All useless,Masrim,1
going do some normal rifts for powerful engrams if anyone wants to help me,xspartinx,1
strikes,xspartinx,1
lol,xspartinx,1
How do you get powerful from normal strikes?,Masrim,1
mildstone,xspartinx,1
Ahh the heroics. They are easy today. Solar and heavy,Masrim,1
no normals,xspartinx,1
i got to do 2 normals,xspartinx,1
For a powerful Engram?,Masrim,1
wait it not powerful just a leg,xspartinx,1
my b,xspartinx,1
Heroics should count,Masrim,1
For those don't they?,Masrim,1
we can try it yea want to,xspartinx,1
it says mildstone under normal strikes,xspartinx,1
I'm not at home yet. Walking the dog,Masrim,1
Usually that is the minimum,Masrim,1
I think,Masrim,1
no idea,xspartinx,1
But you need to do 3 heroics any way,Masrim,1
yea,xspartinx,1
i just swaped from ps4 to pc on sunday,xspartinx,1
so it's probably the nightfall unlock milestone,Arixama,1
Sounds like it,Masrim,1
yes it is,xspartinx,1
every time i try to get randoms it puts me in there solo,xspartinx,1
That's people abondoning because they don't like the strike,Masrim,1
and why are my wait time so dang long on everything takes like 10 mins to just get in a crucible match,xspartinx,1

what time works for you?,Trissin,1
"or if you can't run it tonight, that's totally fine too",Trissin,1

Like..it's early morning weekdays and before noon on weekends as best time,Aberration,1
ouch those arent very popular times haha,Trissin,1
well dont worry about it,Trissin,1

"that being said, if we have a spot tomorrow night ill be sure to let u know",Trissin,1
"meanwhile i am interested in running some more raids in this clan, such as the raid lairs or the prestige raids",Trissin,1

should we try finding randoms?,Arixama,1
"I mean, I don't think I'm gonna be able to tonight. Maybe tomorrow night or tomorrow during the day?",Oathbreaker,1
tomorrow is reset and the challenge changes doesnt it?,Arixama,1
Shit. Wasn't thinking,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, it will change, which means the next time it will be Calus will be 4 weeks from now. Last week before Forsaken.",Oathbreaker,1
i,Arixama,1
i'm sure people will be looking for raids. i believe theres some requirement in solstice of heroes to do the challenges for the armor sets?,Arixama,1
Maybe? I'm not quite sure.,Oathbreaker,1
"im hunting region chests right now, cause thats something i gotta do",Arixama,1
Snagged the SMG. That's all the EP weapons now thank Christ,Oathbreaker,1
"gratz. ive got all the region chests, now i just need a spire completion",Arixama,1
Same. You busy tomorrow Ari? We could do Spire and some EP stuff. I've got the day off.,Oathbreaker,1
nice!!,Trissin,1
both haha,Trissin,1
sry didnt mean to interrupt lol,Trissin,1
Lmao all good dude,Oathbreaker,1
"i work til 630ish, but after that im free",Arixama,1
Anyone on PC right now want to start grinding through the Solstice activities?,Oathbreaker,1
"I'd be game for solstice and EP later in the week for sure, Thursday/Friday and on I'll have a ton of time",Aberration,1
also does anyone still need to do rat king stuff?,Aberration,1
I do.  I think I am at public events,Masrim,1
Im still at the first step w/ patrols but I'd be happy to help out to try to bust those out later this wk too,Aberration,1
"ooh imstill on the last step, nightfall with rat king",Trissin,1
or someone else on the same step,Trissin,1
@Oathbreaker your arch nemesis,Sabre,1
LMAO,Oathbreaker,1
Listen I just have this name because why not hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
anybody want to solstice?,Arixama,1
what is solstice?,Masrim,1
the event currently going on.,Arixama,1
completely ignorant of anything going on,Masrim,1
"basically some of the sotry missions got revamped, andyou can get 400 armor . also what the triumph are for",Arixama,1
I would like the 400 armor please,Masrim,1
_the grind is so real_,Trissin,1
I'm guessing it's not solo content,Masrim,1
it can be,Arixama,1
it's harder solo though,Arixama,1
But I kick ass. Unless there's jumping involved,Masrim,1
Well I have an hour and a half of anyone's game,Masrim,1
"we can run through the missions, cause those seem like the hardest requirements as far as i've gotten so far",Arixama,1
I am in front of the homecoming lady,Masrim,1
"hey all, if anybody else is free and interested i'd like to run a raid tonight with our clan",Trissin,1
I'm definitely down.,Arixama,1
"if anybody still requires completions of eow, spire, or any prestige raids for solstice/triumphs i'd be down to go thru it",Trissin,1
"Oh heck yeah, I'll be free tonight after a while, so I'm down for any raid!",RonInDune,1
I need a spire completion. I'm only on the blue armor for solstice so I don't know what the later requirements are,Arixama,1
I haven't been in the game for a few days so i still have to check out the solstice stuff,RonInDune,1
"well, if you aspire to be a farmer then solstice is for you!",Trissin,1
it's pretty cool stuff but there is a lot of grinding,Trissin,1
:((,Trissin,1
Well I did like farming in ARPGs so I may or may not hate myself for doing this,RonInDune,1
lool,Trissin,1
"well in regards to the solstice event, i dont think any of the armor requires completion of spire

but there is a triumph unlock for 20 points which requires you to complete EOW and spire @Arixama",Trissin,1
i would be interested in doing spire tonight,Trissin,1
That's the only raid I need for the triumph. I'm gonna get me all the everything.,Arixama,1
even the exotic ship?? 😮,Trissin,1
thats the one for getting all the armor right?,Arixama,1
Yeah,Trissin,1
So much farming,Trissin,1
if i managed to do all the faction rallys this season i think i can do this?,Arixama,1
i hope,Arixama,1
:o you got 50 on all 3???,Trissin,1
yeah,Arixama,1
When is the raid gonna be? I have family over tonight but might be able to log on for an EOW,Oathbreaker,1
"yo! I don't have a strict timeframe, I can be on when it's convenient for the rest of the group",Trissin,1
im good whenever,Arixama,1
okay cool,Trissin,1
@Oathbreaker what times are good for u?,Trissin,1
Not too sure. Dinner is at 6:30 EST and that might be a little while. Girlfriend is also over so I might not be able to tonight,Oathbreaker,1
okok dont stress it,Trissin,1
anyone up for redux missions?,Arixama,1
alright so I've got two friends who would like to try spire for their first time tonight,Trissin,1
forewarning however they are a bit cancerous,Trissin,1
"that's fine, my mic has a mute function",Arixama,1
I can help with raids. Haven't done any prestiege though. I'm good all day,Helatia,1
just farming solstice right now,Helatia,1
"alright cool, that makes 5",Trissin,1
"actually wait, if ron is joining us then we have 6 i believe",Trissin,1
"just to make sure, if we are doing spire then you should be around 365+ light",Trissin,1
im good,Arixama,1
385,Arixama,1
385 also,Helatia,1
perfect,Trissin,1
I'm 370,RonInDune,1
But when exactly are we starting?,RonInDune,1
does 8:15 work for everyone?,Trissin,1
cst?,Arixama,1
8:15 est would be 7:15 cst,Trissin,1
we can push it back,Trissin,1
"ok, i thought you were est but i couldnt remember",Arixama,1
just making sure i knew the right time,Arixama,1
👍,Trissin,1
i'm so close to the 400 armor,Arixama,1
"same here, just a few minor things",Trissin,1
"i need 3 of the missions, nightfall and adventures",Arixama,1
and 5 crucible wins,Arixama,1
The 5 crucible wins took me a while haha,Trissin,1
"Ive got 1 story, nightfall, 3 heroic strikes, and the adventures",Trissin,1
"just gonna ping @RonInDune and @Helatia , does 8:15 work?",Trissin,1
~45 minutes from now,Trissin,1
i can get me a tshirt now,Arixama,1
Yeah I'm good at that time,RonInDune,1
helatia says hes good too,Arixama,1
sweet,Trissin,1
invites are out @Arixama @Helatia,Trissin,1
do I have to do this stuff for each character?,Masrim,1
Heroic strike at 279 light is not fun,Masrim,1
why are you doing heroic strikes at such a low light?,Arixama,1
"if your going for the elemental orbs, you can just do regular strikes",Arixama,1
"it seems that elemental orbs drop more often from majors, apparently a good way to farm them is to load up the nightfall and kill the yellow-bar goblins at the start and just keep repeating that",Trissin,1
or so i've heard,Trissin,1
"Zeta and I just got the Legendary 405 gear. I'm not gonna be around this weekend, but after that if anyone is looking to grind out masterworks let me know",Sabre,1
"anyone looking to grind anything out tonight? Havent logged in since reset, blank canvas here",Aberration,1
I have ~1 hour of class right now but afterwards im good,Aberration,1
I though we might try the spire raid again if we have time and numbers. We got super close last night!,RonInDune,1
whisper anybody? :)),Trissin,1
I still need to go for that catalyst... Won't be out of work til later tho,Aberration,1
I'm down for the whisper quest whoever wants to do it,Peronix,1
How hard is the catalyst mission? Lots of jumping again?,Masrim,1
it's the exact same mission. get the chests+oracles first then load back into it and complete it.,thegoaliebear,1
Higher light though,Arixama,1
you'll still get one shot don't worry lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Do you need a full fireteam for the chests and oracles? Or is that doable alone?,Arixama,1
you can do those alone.,thegoaliebear,1
Where are the chests? When I went through it for the first time I didn't see a single chest...,RonInDune,1
they are hiddne,Trissin,1
Figures,RonInDune,1
"haha yeah the map is so big, i cant imagine how people ever found all of them",Trissin,1
Especially as fast as they did,Arixama,1
"yeah, kinda crazy haha",Trissin,1
"im so close to finishing the armor, just need to do the arms",Trissin,1
heroic strikes woo,Trissin,1
"I need prestige raid, highscore nightfall and heroic strikes",Arixama,1
i can help you out with some of those,Trissin,1
lets see if we can get a group together for the prestige raid,Trissin,1
and we'll definitely need a third for the nightfall,Trissin,1
id be game for NF,Aberration,1
I'm afraid of the prestige raid.,Arixama,1
@RonInDune if you look in the pinned messages in #destiny-spoilers we have videos of where each chest is as well as the order to shoot the three waves of oracles.,thegoaliebear,1
haha the prestige raid isn't bad @Arixama !,Trissin,1
I'll be home here soon,Arixama,1
really its okay,Trissin,1
@thegoaliebear Thanks!,RonInDune,1
"You have to switch runners in gauntlet, right?",Arixama,1
im game for whatever - ll around 365-370,Aberration,1
yeah you have to switch roles in gauntlet,Trissin,1
dont worry its not bad,Trissin,1
It's pretty easy,Helatia,1
Yeet,Helatia,1
"Im not sure if im sold on grinding out the armor on every char, seems like something thats gonna be replaced in a month or so",Aberration,1
do it for the ship!,Helatia,1
wait til next week though,Arixama,1
mayhem is back and will make the super kills some much less painful,Arixama,1
hmm,Aberration,1
yea,Aberration,1
true.,Helatia,1
How do you get to the spoiler talk,Masrim,1
you gotta watch a new movie before everyone else and ruin it for them,Aberration,1
The mission was possible,Masrim,1
Snape kills dumbledore,Helatia,1
Henry Cavill is the bad guy,Masrim,1
Bruce Willis is dead the whole time,Helatia,1
IRL?,Masrim,1
6th sense,Helatia,1
;),Masrim,1
"orbs are love, orbs are life",Aberration,1
i mean its not as rough as faction rally,Aberration,1
@Masrim you didn't have the `spoilers enabled` role but I added it to you. you should be able to see the spoiler channel now.,thegoaliebear,1
see...told you if you spoiled enough movies you'd get in,Aberration,1
@thegoaliebear  How about hooking me up as well? 😃,Helatia,1
sure👍,thegoaliebear,1
you tha bomb,Helatia,1
@PC if anyone needs whisper i've got the portal,Arixama,1
prestiege or regular?,Helatia,1
regular. heroic is just on the map,Arixama,1
oh right,Helatia,1
"if you need to do heroic, i dont have the catalyst yet",Arixama,1
I'm down after this adventure,Helatia,1
I’m down as well,Peronix,1
Sweet!,Helatia,1

"It's solar, glass, and melee today btw.",Helatia,1
ah well,Trissin,1

if not its fine,Trissin,1
I tried to add it. Thanks goal,Masrim,1
ahh whos down for some destiny,Masrim,1
"never thought of this before, but is discord free?  not for users, but for hosts",Masrim,1
"yep, it's free to host servers",Trissin,1
@Masrim Destiny is overrated! All the cool kids these days play only Duke Nukem Forever.,RonInDune,1
That's why it's called Forever!,Arixama,1
finally got that emblem!! 400 triumph points _woo_,Trissin,1
Congrats @Trissin ! That must have taken some grinding skills!,RonInDune,1
lol thanks ron! it actualy wasnt as bad as i'd imagined,Trissin,1
"i have to say, the green solstice armor set is very misleading",Trissin,1
after the green is smooth riding,Trissin,1
Green makes me rage. Anyone looking to raid or anything fancy tonight? I'd be happy to join in,Aberration,1
Id be down! Anything you wanted to do in particular @Aberration ?,Trissin,1
correct me if I'm wrong but I seem to recall you hadn't done all the raids yet?,Trissin,1
"Well... I've never finished Leviathan got to Baths before we stopped. I've done EoW all the way, but haven't stepped in SoS at all.",Aberration,1
I'm game for whatever honestly. I'm not picky I'm more in it for the experience/a little challenge,Aberration,1
I might be down for eater of worlds in around 45 mins,RonInDune,1
Works for me!,Aberration,1
@RonInDune this will be your first eater right?,Trissin,1
Yup yup,RonInDune,1
"okay cool, yeah",Trissin,1
we'll do eater of worlds starting at 8:15 est (7:15 cst) then,Trissin,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1
"Cool cool. I'll log on in a few, playing some SNES right now haha",Aberration,1
👍 👍,Trissin,1
"I've got +1 as well, so we have 4 in total now",Trissin,1
2 more at 815 pls,Trissin,1
I was stressing about the green because I thought we only had until Tuesday morning to get it done,Masrim,1
lool,Trissin,1
alright so we got 4 people for eow,Trissin,1
"@PC doing a fresh run of EOW, no experience necessary at all, we have 2 spots open!",Trissin,1
anybody want to run it with us?,Trissin,1
"I can, but I won’t be on till around 9. But y’all can go ahead if that’s too lare",Peronix,1
Late,Peronix,1
"im okay with postponing till 9, is that okay with u @RonInDune ?",Trissin,1
and @Aberration,Trissin,1
"I can be on a titan or lock, whatever the raid needs",Aberration,1
and thats fine i have free time tonight,Aberration,1
It's perfect actually! My code was still compiling and I needed a few more minutes.,RonInDune,1
okay sweet,Trissin,1
SO that's like 40 mins from now?,RonInDune,1
yep,Trissin,1
awesome,Trissin,1
can we get 1 more for EOW in 30 minutes? @PC,Trissin,1
WHAT'LL YOU GIVE ME,Masrim,1
ack,Masrim,1
5 dolla,Aberration,1
Venmo it over,Masrim,1
I can teach you how to fly a kite.,RonInDune,1
I live near power lines! Are you trying to kill me?!?,Masrim,1
"Think on the bright side, you might discover electricity! And become a new Ben Franklin for our age!",RonInDune,1
"Oh, sorry I forgot to mention I’m in Central time.  Y’all can go ahead though",Peronix,1
shheeeeeit,Aberration,1
riiiip,Trissin,1
Well we can try early tomorrow maybe?,RonInDune,1
I'm free more or less the entire day,RonInDune,1
i think we can get a run going tonight,Trissin,1
Oh that'd be fantastic,RonInDune,1
Still need another for EOW?,TRex1780,1
I think so,Aberration,1
Hmm so I am in home coming but there is this big white barrier keeping me from progressing,Masrim,1
gotta clear everything,Aberration,1
or maybe it glitched :mind_blown:,Aberration,1
The only thing left is in the other side of the barrier lol,Masrim,1
RIP,Aberration,1
oh yeah,Trissin,1
thats happened to me a lot,Trissin,1
jump down and go to the left,Trissin,1
I tried going around. Just killed myself. See if that works,Masrim,1
I found the enemy placements and stuff are a bit different,RonInDune,1
"Also, is it just me or is my Ghost not speaking at all?",RonInDune,1
nope hes quiet,Aberration,1
ah good I though I messed up my settings,RonInDune,1
oops sorry mispaste,RonInDune,1
so @TRex1780 are you good to join us?,Trissin,1
I'm good! I'm in orbit now and ready to go,TRex1780,1
awesome,Trissin,1
I'll be online in 2 minutes,RonInDune,1
Can peronix replace me once he is on,Masrim,1
I don't think it will be a very long run....,Trissin,1
@Peronix,Trissin,1
where are we chatting,Masrim,1
im going to inv,Trissin,1
i sent u a friend request @Masrim,Trissin,1
"alright, we got thru eow and now we're gonna run leviathan",Trissin,1
we just need 1 person,Trissin,1
@PC,Trissin,1
anybody interested in leviathan tonight?,Trissin,1
normal ?,AY AY RON,1
"yep, normal",Trissin,1
yeah i'll join for normal,AY AY RON,1
okay sweet,Trissin,1
Shooshi16#1499,AY AY RON,1
my btag,AY AY RON,1
ill do leviathan,MrGommyBoy,1
Im totally up for another round of levi today if we have a few takers.,Aberration,1
im good for that as well,Trissin,1
Anyone need heavy strikes done?  Im going to pound a few out,Masrim,1
heading uptown for a few but if any raid-esque things start to form I'm down in an hour or so,Aberration,1
@Masrim if you're still looking to do some strikes i have a few that I need to run,Aberration,1
I'm in 1au right now if you want to jump in,Masrim,1
"will need about 10 or so, but maybe then if you're still there haha",Aberration,1
Power just cut out will be on in a min,Aberration,1
I already took your spot,Masrim,1
any  wanna do soh with me,xspartinx,1
Ended up mowing my lawn. I'm still looking to hit some nightfall tonight if anyone is game in 30-45m?,Aberration,1
"yea im in, send me an invite when you sign back on",Nazgul,1
Cool cool. Sorry I am taking longer than expected,Aberration,1
@PC anyone for NF - need 1 more,Aberration,1
"Yeah, hang on",RonInDune,1
kk,Aberration,1
"need 1 for heroic whisper
we did oracles just need it cleared",xspartinx,1
"hey guys, so my friend danny (littlepants) wants to do a prestige leviathan before the reset, and i believe some other people in our clan also need the completion for the solstice masterwork",Trissin,1
is anybody interested in running a prestige leviathan starting around 8pm est (7pm cst) tonight?,Trissin,1
@PC,Trissin,1
What's the LL required for that?,Aberration,1
"If I can help, I will",Aberration,1
"I believe it's still 300, if you are higher than that then you will just be scaled down",Trissin,1
regardless of light ads will hurt a **lot**,Trissin,1
it's mostly a matter of mechanics,Trissin,1
You only need to wear the solstice armor to create orbs right?  Don't need to wear it on crucible,Masrim,1
"yeah, wearing the full set is just to generate orbs",Trissin,1
you can just wear individual pieces for the specific objectives,Trissin,1
That's good to know,Masrim,1
"I'm willing to help out with the Levi, but fair warning I've only completed it fully once (this week first time haha) but it did go pretty smooth ;)",Aberration,1
I'd love to do it on my Titan for the milestone but I don't have any raid gear on him yet womp womp,Aberration,1
"I think you played perfectly fine @Aberration , very well for first completion haha",Trissin,1
You're more than welcome to join,Trissin,1
Great! Sign me up then. Barring any unforeseen circumstances I should be available,Aberration,1
sweet! Anybody else for prestige Leviathan tonight? I believe @Arixama and @Helatia expressed some interest a while ago but I might be misremembering,Trissin,1
"You can sign me up! I think Ari is working tonight, though @Trissin",Helatia,1
I wish I could come in tonight! Best of luck guys.,RonInDune,1
"Okay gotcha @Helatia , thanks! Also thank you Ron, we'll definitely be doing more runs of prestige levi in the weeks to come for everybody who needs a completion or is just interested in joining :))",Trissin,1
I need to bust out those soh armor sets,Aberration,1
If anyone needs blue missions I'll likely be on those steps this week,Aberration,1
I close tonight so I won't be home until around 9 central,Helatia,1
"I'm actually on a short vacation, so I won't be back on until possibly late Wednesday night or thursday evening",Arixama,1
"i'll probably be down for prestige some time in the future, currently waiting for mayhem to do more soh armor requirements",AY AY RON,1
"i hate crucible, just saying",Masrim,1
I feel so bad for my team,Masrim,1
Any weapon suggestions,Masrim,1
Do you think they messed up and it was supposed to be 10 super kills and 30 guardian,Masrim,1
And they just don't want to admit they fucked up,Masrim,1
"@Trissin not sure what you do at prestige calus, but we have two people fixed in the throne room by having only the shadow realm people punch the psions. makes things a lot less hectic.",thegoaliebear,1
"oh okay, i gotchu",Trissin,1
"yeah i think that might be a good strat to do, we'll see how it goes",Trissin,1
thank you fearless clan mother,Trissin,1
All hail!,RonInDune,1
Crucible steps for green SOH armor makes me cringe so hard,Aberration,1
im about to embark on that,Aberration,1
noooo wait for mayhem tomorrow,Trissin,1
Ehhh yeaaa,Aberration,1
probably should,Aberration,1
finish all the other green objectives but leave the guardian and super kills,Trissin,1
gotta warm up my grav lance for maximum meta trolling,Aberration,1
loool,Trissin,1
"For the rec, I can't stay up super super long tonight since I have to work in the AM - 9 cst may be a bit late for me :\",Aberration,1
Ugh 5 hours PvP 37% super kills. Suck+Hunter= torture,Masrim,1
:(((,Trissin,1
Can someone log onto my account and do it for me lol,Masrim,1
@Trissin lol no problem. it just makes it easy to optimize the shadow team for damage. that way the two in throne room can use their supers freely and really focus on adds instead of having to worry about punching a psion as well.,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone up for some heroic strikes?,RonInDune,1
"hey all, sorry I know we were going to do a run through of prestige leviathan tonight but there's a storm right above my place rn and my power's already gone out 3 times today",Trissin,1
not to mention there also seems to be some timing issues since people are away and busy,Trissin,1
"you're more than welcome to continue with the run but I don't think my power+internet are reliable enough for tonight, i'll be running it another time",Trissin,1
sorry @Aberration and @Helatia,Trissin,1
Woof!,Aberration,1
maybe next week,Aberration,1
guess that means I'll be grinding SoH.... 💀,Aberration,1
It's all good. It happens,Helatia,1
anyone up to run EoW?,Sabre,1
"im farming solstice stuff right now, how about later @Sabre ?",Trissin,1
Anyone game for some NF?,Aberration,1
"littlepants and I need to do nf, but littlepants needs to get his blue first",Trissin,1
Cool cool. I need to get on that too...but the crucible. Blah,Aberration,1
it makes me so sad,Aberration,1
:(((,Trissin,1
so do we not the full set of SOH gear in crucible?,Aberration,1
"So if we were to run a prestige leviathan tomorrow night, who would be available for that?",Trissin,1
"I probably will, but I can't confirm until around 4 PM tomorrow",RonInDune,1
I don't think I will :(,Aberration,1
I'm gonna be back to weekend duty most likely,Aberration,1
I'm down if you don't mind me having limited experience with the raid,Peronix,1
hey id be down and im sure Zeta would be too,Sabre,1
hmm... how much experience do you have @Peronix,Trissin,1
"I’ve done the room with the patrolling war beasts, the room with the three staffs, and a little of the baths",Peronix,1
hmm... what light are you?,Trissin,1
"also, have @Sabre or zeta completed prestige leviathan before?",Trissin,1
might be a bit of a challenge with 5 people who havent done it before,Trissin,1
we can give it a shot though,Trissin,1
how does starting tonight at 8 EST sound?,Trissin,1
Right now 352 but I’m grinding the solstice armor for 400 and almost got it done. Just need Crucible wins and some more arc super kills,Peronix,1
oh yeah thats high enough,Trissin,1
finally got the ship!!!!,Trissin,1
my god,Trissin,1
what a grind,Trissin,1
Congrats dude! Does it look good?,RonInDune,1
yaaaassss it looks cool!!,Trissin,1
"hey sorry, i ended up being busy last night so i couldnt join in. Im trying to grind the ship out too its tough",Sabre,1
dont worry about it!,Trissin,1
all good 👍,Trissin,1
alright haha im trying to cram in as much of this event as I can cause im gonna be busy so much during it between moving to school and being out of town for a week on top of that,Sabre,1
yeeep yeah haha,Trissin,1
how are far are you on your solstice armor sets?,Trissin,1
"about halfway through the second scorched set. Hopefully will have it mostly done with Rekindled by tomorrow. I finished the entire first set in 2 days so if I need to reproduce that grind, I will lol",Sabre,1
I love the Estival Excursion too much to pass it up,Sabre,1
"jesus , 2 days",Trissin,1
I had to play through the story on a third character cause I didnt have a titan yet,Sabre,1
impressive haha,Trissin,1
yeah haha it was brutal but it worked,Sabre,1
oh no,Trissin,1
"well let us know if you need help with any of the solstice stuff, im sure we'll be able to help out",Trissin,1
"will do for sure, I appreciate it",Sabre,1
I could use some help on solstice,Masrim,1
soooo does anybody want to do the prestige leviathan tonight? @PC,Trissin,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
Roger,Peronix,1
"great, that would make 4 with littlepants and I",Trissin,1
2 more for prestige leviathan?,Trissin,1
Ah darn I would have but I just made plans to go out with a couple friends,Sabre,1
@TheCnC and I would be down,Arixama,1
To attempt at least,Arixama,1
"okay, awesome",Trissin,1

Coming up now,RonInDune,1
okay we're in the voice chat,Trissin,1
Good luck guys!,Oathbreaker,1
thanks!!,Trissin,1
"Thanks for a fantastic raid guys! I apologize for being whiny towards the end, but we got it!",RonInDune,1
"it was a long one and we all got a bit whiny, its definitely ok",Arixama,1
Trying to bust out a blue set this weekend. Anyone want to do nightfall in a few hours or maybe tmrw?,Aberration,1
@Aberration is it just completion or the highscore run?,Trissin,1
It's just completion. I believe...,Aberration,1
Blue warlock set,Aberration,1
oh okay we can run that easily,Trissin,1
just let me know when you're on,Trissin,1
Sweet deal. Thanks much! I'm taking a half day today so I'll probably be on in a few hrs,Aberration,1
👍,Trissin,1
"i work at 2 cst, so if its before then i can help",Arixama,1
@Arixama I just got weasel'd and now have to wait a few thousand years to log back in,Oathbreaker,1
Anyone know how to take screenshots of D2 stuff?,Oathbreaker,1
Guess you're not playing this afternoon,Masrim,1
Howd the prestige run go last night?,Sabre,1
"hey gang, anyone up for that NF?",Aberration,1
"that is, if you can login within the next millenia?",Aberration,1
lol RIP @Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
btw im good for that nightfall @Aberration,Trissin,1
hey lmfao so Zeta didnt know this was a text channel because the i think the role assign bot is offline,Sabre,1
oh no lol!,Trissin,1
i just gave him the role,Trissin,1
he should be able to see this channel now,Trissin,1
"i'm in game, ready to go when you are bud - thanks for the help 😃",Aberration,1
haha welcome to our pc chat @zetaa !,Trissin,1
I'll jump in the NF,Oathbreaker,1
is this the secret channel youve all been hiding from me,zetaa,1
"he was like ""man i wish we had a general chat for just PC players"" and i was like oh we just use the lfg channel and he had no idea what i was talking about lmaoo",Sabre,1
rest in pepperoni,Trissin,1
its okay hes here now,Trissin,1
Whats up homies.  Anyone need H Strikes or NF?,Aberration,1
"I could probably do some, still on greens though",Masrim,1
So much easier I might get all 3 chars done today in a couple hours,Masrim,1
37 to 87 in 20 min. The first 37 took hours. Haha,Masrim,1
Yay blue on one,Masrim,1
Im doing missions now,Aberration,1
@Masrim if you want in,Aberration,1
Cool. I'll jump in,Masrim,1
Hate trying to grind orbs in strikes and the other 2 people don't have any master works,Masrim,1
:(((,Trissin,1
Just load up the nightfall and goring the first area.,Arixama,1
Grind*,Arixama,1
"^^
this works",Trissin,1
"I killed everything but the Knights, got the orbs, let the knights kill me, repeat.",Arixama,1
Wish I knew that before haha.  2 sets blue now. 1 to go,Masrim,1
Are you grinding all the greens first?,Arixama,1
Yeah,Masrim,1
Almost finished all 3,Masrim,1
It's such a weird grind scale,Arixama,1
Sure is,Masrim,1
Got my purple on lock today. Pretty happy about that. Working on Titan now will need to do all redux for blues if you need them Masrim,Aberration,1
Need to do Green on my Titan. If I do it fast enough I'm considering leveling up a Warlock,Oathbreaker,1
So it turns out I need to do the crucible milestone to get Mayhem. Well.,Oathbreaker,1
This sucks.,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah. Have to do 2 quick and 2 competitive.  The comp goes fast if you get survival,Masrim,1
Finally found something good about The nokris strike. Great for orbs,Masrim,1
I fucking hate crucible so fucking much. I don't enjoy this at all.,Oathbreaker,1
I used to be able to play so well in D1 but it feels so different that I just can't do a damn thing.,Oathbreaker,1
Crucible makes me rage,Aberration,1
It's antifun for the most part,Aberration,1
It's so antifun for me.,Oathbreaker,1
I didn't mind mayhem,Masrim,1
Mayhem is fine for me because it's chaos but expected chaos. Quickplay can be horrible and don't get me started on competitive.,Oathbreaker,1
Finally. All 3 green done. Fuck you orbs,Masrim,1
I'm hoping to get Titan Green Armor before weekly reset,Oathbreaker,1
Can you mix green and blue in missions. I mean 1 person with green one with blue,Masrim,1
Yes,Oathbreaker,1
And get the person with Green to start them,Oathbreaker,1
For some reason they seem easier,Oathbreaker,1
anybody for a heroic whisper completion?,Arixama,1
anyone help me with whisper quick so i can get cat done,xspartinx,1
"If you can manage to have a green set, you can put it on to start the easier mission, then switch to blue. Idk how to have green and blue at the same time but that's what I've heard. Maybe get the green and vault it or put it on another char until you upgrade to blue?",Sabre,1
You vault it. Tested it the other night.,Arixama,1
Dang protips,Aberration,1
Anybody looking to do so missions?,Arixama,1
So you vault your blue?  Or do you have to vault your green and get another green,Masrim,1
"Vault your greens, then interact with the statue.",Arixama,1
What if all you have is Blues,Masrim,1
Then youre screwed.,Arixama,1
Why didn't you tell me this yesterday,Masrim,1
"But if you party up with someone with greens, and have them start the missions that works.",Arixama,1
"I'm still all green, so I can join in in about 30 minutes",RonInDune,1
I'm trying to get on abberat ion and Ron,Masrim,1
I've also got greens I need to do missions for,Arixama,1
Need to do some missions myself. Still on Green Titan Armor lol. Got the crucible done though,Oathbreaker,1
I will have a bunch of time tmrw around 6est,Aberration,1
The most magical thing happened this morning - 5 win streak in crucible to knock out the blue req for my titan,Aberration,1
😮,Trissin,1
congrats!!!,Trissin,1
It was the best. Anyone need those Redux missions?,Aberration,1
i do,Arixama,1
Great,Aberration,1
"I gotta whip up some dinner real quick, want to bust em out in 30-40m?",Aberration,1
definitely,Arixama,1
nice,Aberration,1
OK im about ready took me an hour D:,Aberration,1
sry bout that,Aberration,1
not a problem,Arixama,1
Can I join in?,RonInDune,1
oh yeah sure,Aberration,1
Yeah I just ragequit out of the first chosen mission haha,RonInDune,1
haha yeah they're a bunch of fun,Aberration,1
who wants to rock and roll,Masrim,1
"alright, round 2, any interest in prestige leviathan?",Trissin,1
"mango, littlepants and I will be doing prestige leviathan tomorrow night",Trissin,1
"no exp necessary, mango has never completed prestige before",Trissin,1
good chance to masterwork the chestpiece 👍,Trissin,1
what time you guys thinking?,Arixama,1
"for now it's about 8 ET, so 7 CST but we're very flexible with the time",Trissin,1
we can push it back and forth,Trissin,1
i should be able to join if you need me,Arixama,1
"gotcha, ty ari",Trissin,1
"no problem. if theres someone who needs it for the masterwork, they definitely have priority over me cause ive got it.",Arixama,1
"I won't have good internet where I'll be, so I'll have to skip. Good luck!",RonInDune,1
thanks ron! 2 more for prestige leviathan tonight at 8 ET (7 cst)?,Trissin,1
Wish I had my legendary set done. Getting close though,Masrim,1
sweet!,Trissin,1
do u need any help with it?,Trissin,1
I think I'm pretty much done on the one. Just need to run chosen. Melee kills grenade kills and crucible,Masrim,1
oh ok,Trissin,1
lmk if u need a hand,Trissin,1
Will do.  Going to try to get this one done tonight. Except for crucible,Masrim,1
Then move onto my other one that is partially done,Masrim,1
Trying to get all 3 legendary before the 28th. No idea why since it is moot in September,Masrim,1
obviously for the ship,Arixama,1
^,Trissin,1
"also, for your melee kills, get yourself a sword that the same energy type, empty it ammo, and then kills will count.",Arixama,1
Ship?,Masrim,1
Oh yeah,Masrim,1
I think that only works for Hunter and Titan,Trissin,1
The sword thing,Trissin,1
Nice,Masrim,1
If you're Warlock you can use apotheosis veil and sparrow to refill melee,Trissin,1
I just run around Nessus and punch things. That place with the big jump has a constant spawn,Masrim,1
But not a huge one so it gets overwhelming,Masrim,1
Any good places for grenade kills?,Masrim,1
which class?,Arixama,1
This one is Titan. But I have to do all 3,Masrim,1
I wish I was still unemployed lol,Masrim,1
"titan is arc grenade kills, right?",Arixama,1
insurmountable helps a ton,Trissin,1
I think so,Masrim,1
i still need chosen and spark for my last set legendaries if you need help,Arixama,1
Sounds like a date!  Tonight around 8?,Masrim,1
"depends on if they need me for the prestige run, but if they dont, definitely.",Arixama,1
Ok sounds good. Either way I need then both for my other 2. So whenever you need it,Masrim,1
So I got a really good deal on an iPad for my wife.  Ordered it and got a cover too since the price was good.,Masrim,1
Cover and iPad are shipping separately,Masrim,1
Cover requires signature for delivery,Masrim,1
iPad does not require signature,Masrim,1
Wtf!,Masrim,1
seems legit,Aberration,1
btw @Arixama we are not going to do the raid tonight,Trissin,1
"Alright, good to know! Works pretty well cause my parenta want to go out to dinner.",Arixama,1
"um, I thought I was plan b",Masrim,1
"When I get home, definitely. Shouldn't be too long of a time.",Arixama,1
You eating pizza again,Masrim,1
i promise i eat things other than pizza,Arixama,1
whoooo still needs redux missions?,Aberration,1
I need some. I think most on my Warlock and 1 on my Hunter . I need nf on all 3.,Masrim,1
On a good note I got a BD from crucible last night,Masrim,1
nice! BD will be good looking forward,Aberration,1
i have 1 more H Strike that im on right now then if you want to bust out a mission or 2 I'd be happy to,Aberration,1
just finished,Aberration,1
Won't be on for a bit. Need to walk the dog then see what the wife has planned for me,Masrim,1
Gotcha,Aberration,1
i have escaped her clutches momentarily,Masrim,1
anyone down for a NF?,Masrim,1
"@Masrim im back, up for any redux?",Aberration,1
wondering if anybody here still needs a completion of prestige leviathan? @PC,Trissin,1
"MangoHead and LittlePants still need to do a run, I'd like to do it with them some time this week",Trissin,1
"please let me know if interested! we'd appreciate the help, no prestige exp necessary :))",Trissin,1
I need to do one at some point before the event ends.,Sabre,1
we'd love to have ya,Trissin,1
I might be able to help out. Depends on timing of course,Aberration,1
I'll be available on Sunday evening onwards...,RonInDune,1
"I’d love to go, but I won’t know my Sunday schedule until tomorrow evening",Thawxtem,1
@Trissin is stil need a completion i have done all the encounters tho,Bobthedog,1
okay yeah thats fine @Bobthedog !,Trissin,1
Whens the run?,Bobthedog,1
"haven't decided on a time yet, haha",Trissin,1
are you good with tonight or tomorrow night? around 8pm est,Trissin,1
"If that’s the case, is there still room for one more?",Thawxtem,1
yep!,Trissin,1
that should be a full team,Trissin,1
hey! are you guys good @Bobthedog @Thawxtem,Trissin,1
I actually cant sorry thanks for invite,Bobthedog,1
alright... is anybody open to running a prestige leviathan tonight @PC ?,Trissin,1
Finishing dinner @Trissin,Thawxtem,1
What time are you thinking?,Sabre,1
no worries @Thawxtem !,Trissin,1
actually i was thinking of doing it tonight @Sabre,Trissin,1
"I think he was asking the hour, not the day",Thawxtem,1
i think in about 15 minutes @Sabre,Trissin,1
do u need to push it back?,Trissin,1
So at x:30?,Thawxtem,1
So at x:30?,Thawxtem,1
Invite me when you’re ready. I’m going to be doing Flashpoint: Titan,Thawxtem,1
will do!,Trissin,1
are you okay to join us tonight @Sabre ?,Trissin,1
Do you know if there are any special ghost abilities for Levithan?,Thawxtem,1
special ghost abilities?,Trissin,1
Ex: “gain 10% more XP while in strikes” is on my ghost,Thawxtem,1
oh,Trissin,1
yeah contender's shell has perks for levi,Trissin,1
Exotic?,Thawxtem,1
yes its exotic,Trissin,1
Figures. Thanks anyway,Thawxtem,1
"yep, np",Trissin,1
@Trissin If you still need a sixth i can help but no guarantee of how long i can stay for,Bobthedog,1
Shit sorry guys got caught up and didn't see these,Sabre,1
anyone know what this expired ramen coupon is for?,Masrim,1
pretty sure it's just there for the lore,Trissin,1
it's a message from cayde,Trissin,1
"i think bungie confirmed that there is no second part of the quest, it's just to inspect and read about cayde",Trissin,1
"hmm weird, mine just says  good for a free gyoso or something",Masrim,1
oh i have to hit e to read more,Masrim,1
"Yup. People are speculating all kinds of things, but bungie has said its just a gift from cayde.",Arixama,1
"Gonna be close on my Titan for solstice armor. Need super kills, Nightfall, Crucible wins, 2 more strikes, Void melee kills, Adventures, and then all the missions.",Oathbreaker,1
It'll be super fucking close lol.,Oathbreaker,1
you can make it!,Trissin,1
"for void melee kills, super kills count btw so I can just run around shield bashing everything with doom fang pauldrons",Trissin,1
(also you can grab a void sword and melee things with it once it's out of ammo),Trissin,1
@here would anyone be interested in running heroic stikes and a high score nightfall later on today so I can finish up my masterworks?,Arixama,1
"I would love to help with Heroic strikes tonight, I need them for blue solstice armor. I get off of work at 9:00 CST",Thawxtem,1
I'm gonna do the Whisper shadow thrall room for my super kills. Strikes are done.,Oathbreaker,1
Will do the whisper room for the void melees as well,Oathbreaker,1
"Then it's adventures, NF, crucible, and missions.",Oathbreaker,1
"The adventures and missions are gonna be okay, the NF will be alright, it's crucible that I'm worried about (Ari can attest to the last time I had to do PvP and how defeated I sounded)",Oathbreaker,1
I have my Hunter left for armor...stuck on crucible supers. So mad about it and I don't even know if I want to do it,Aberration,1
It's antifun for me,Aberration,1
"After about 5 hours, oath still hadn't managed 5 wins in mayhem. Awful luck.",Arixama,1
Wood,Aberration,1
Woof*,Aberration,1
"I was able to finish that two days ago without mayhem. It was a pain, but it’s possible",Thawxtem,1
I usually don't have problems with wins it's really just super kills. Maybe I'll try golden gun,Aberration,1
I used arcstrider,Thawxtem,1
What I have problems with is actually winning.,Thawxtem,1
"Arc is OK but it seems that the folks I've been matching with are smart, stand their ground and unreasonably accurate",Aberration,1
Or maybe I'm just bad. That's a thing too haha,Aberration,1
Are you using your dodge?,Arixama,1
Someone here gave me the advice to use the set that makes you harder to kill when dodging and spam it. Got me close enough for at least one kill typically,Thawxtem,1
Yeah it just takes forever to get 30,Aberration,1
its a sad time,Aberration,1
As I said: Ari knows my pain from my Hunter attempts. Titan is gonna be interesting as well.,Oathbreaker,1
Titan was easy compared to Hunter. Way easier,Masrim,1
the worst part about hunter is you hav eto do the 20 challenges. titan and warlock its just defeat enemies,Arixama,1
Is it worth it to try and get Legendary Solstice gear on a Titan I haven't created yet?,Thawxtem,1
"Also, Heric strikes anyone?",Thawxtem,1
*heroic,Thawxtem,1
the biggest question is if you want the ship,Arixama,1
Remember you have to complete the story to get the tower.,Oathbreaker,1
but getting through the story...,Thawxtem,1
Until you hit the tower you won't get the green armor.,Oathbreaker,1
"Ya, and that's my main stopper",Thawxtem,1
"Max vanguard rank and get ship, or save tokens for Forsaken?",Aberration,1
Personal opinion: Max Vanguard. Gets you the ship and a MoT,Oathbreaker,1
PSA: Clean out your postmaster today,Aberration,1
Update is available for download and it's a doozy.,Arixama,1
36 gigs or so.,Arixama,1
36!! Can you go by my house and get it started for me,Masrim,1
Only if there's pizza waiting for me,Arixama,1
There should be dominoes there,Masrim,1
"New nighthawk with random perks -- Bow Targeting, Fusion Rifle Targeting, Hands on -- Rocket Launcher Reserves, Sword Reserves",Sabre,1
Sweet jeebus that IS a big update,Aberration,1
omg its almost like d1 again,Trissin,1
The new gun system is .. confusing,RonInDune,1
"@RonInDune takes a bit to get used to. I'm sure there's a way to differentiate between primaries and secondaries. I thought I saw a post on Reddit saying that if a gun is angled to the left then it's a secondary, while to the right is primary. I could be wrong though",Oathbreaker,1
"That's accurate for kinetic vs energy, but not for ammo type.",Arixama,1
It'll probably be a lot easier once forsaken drops and we have a whole campaign of getting new weapons to actually get used to the new system.,Arixama,1
I'm looking forward to more diversity in loadouts. I feel as if I've been very stagnant in what I use,Aberration,1
Super busy week I haven't even logged in since the patch,Aberration,1
I havent even downloaded the patch yet RIP,Trissin,1
RIP your internet bill. 36GB dude,Oathbreaker,1
"I just t re-downloaded the whole game on Ps4, 35gb base, 45gb patch.",Arixama,1
Back in my day games only took 4 floppies to install and any game above 3 MB contains too much fluff.,RonInDune,1
"Let's petition Bungie to reduce game size by 99%, they've got to listen to the customers.",RonInDune,1
Do that and destiny just becomes a clicker.,Arixama,1
I don't know. I remember lands of lore or something that was like 44 discs,Masrim,1
"so I download 36gb, then I have to download another 7gb?",Masrim,1
"its been sitting on initializing for 30 minutes, sigh",Masrim,1
i just downloaded the patch today,Trissin,1
I had the exact same problem,Trissin,1
i was stuck on initializing forever,Trissin,1
"i think you have to fix it manually @Masrim , it will just say initializing forever",Trissin,1
and it's a fairly lengthy process,Trissin,1
if you are still stuck on initializing just send me a quick msg and ill try to help you out,Trissin,1
Anyone want to jump into a private match real quick? Want to test the OHK range of the new shotgun I got.,Oathbreaker,1
It literally was ready to play just as I got to to go to bed,Masrim,1
I'm taking it as a sign to not play yet,Masrim,1
Whose going to be playing gambit tomorrow?,Arixama,1
"Definitely me. Can't wait to try it, looks super cool.",Oathbreaker,1
SO.. big update = even less to do?,Masrim,1
Big update = get used to new weapons system so you don't have to learn it when the big new stuff to do goes well in.,Arixama,1
"Also the only things gone are trials, heroic strikes and scoring on prestige nightfalls I think",Arixama,1
perfect paradox/ auto or scout/ whisper,Masrim,1
they really got rid of the variation,Masrim,1
PP can be replaced weith ikelos sg if you have it,Masrim,1
I've heard that there's a auto leveler?,RonInDune,1
"I have only two characters at lvl 30, one char at almost max light",RonInDune,1
i got a piece of new armor with bow/pulse stabilizer and arc protection,Masrim,1
Not yet. After forsaken there will be a level 30 boost that i believe skips the main campaign. Most likely will also give some sort of armor at 345 if I had to guess.,Arixama,1
It's also impossible to judge what they did or didn't do as far as gun variation right now.,Arixama,1
I think the boost is the same as the spark of light from D1 where it just instantly levels you up,Trissin,1
i cant recall for sure but i think you got a set of basic and somewhat under-levelled armor as well,Trissin,1
That's cool. I don't think I would grind my third character to max level fully otherwise.,RonInDune,1
Currently working on that myself. Trying to get my Warlock through main campaign and to 30.,Oathbreaker,1
Who's up for some Gambit?,Oathbreaker,1
it's out today?!?!?,Trissin,1
is today that trial thing,Trissin,1
24 Hour Trial,Oathbreaker,1
😮,Trissin,1
"Anyone's up for it, just @ me and I'll party up.",Oathbreaker,1
I'm a bit busy today but I'll see if I have some time to hop on and play some gambit,Trissin,1
tell me how it goes!,Trissin,1
Will do!,Oathbreaker,1
It's so fucking fun.,Oathbreaker,1
Like 10/10 fun.,Oathbreaker,1
!!!!!!!,Trissin,1
i have to go out in 10 minutes but ill make time for 1 match haha,Trissin,1
Grouped up with some randoms and we smashed our first team,Oathbreaker,1
So much fun,Oathbreaker,1
nice!!!,Trissin,1
Where is it on the director?,Arixama,1
Between strikes and crucible,Oathbreaker,1
"i think its just under strikes and crucible, in its own little thing",Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
I'm going to guess the drifter isn't in the tower yet?,Arixama,1
Nope,Oathbreaker,1
Not that I'm aware of,Oathbreaker,1
"There's no rewards, right?",Arixama,1
oh my god that is so much fun i want to play this forever,Trissin,1
"i matchmade with some randoms and wrecked the first team, it felt awesome",Trissin,1
This is too much fucking fun,Oathbreaker,1
Waaaay too much fun,Oathbreaker,1
Wait...good pvp?,Aberration,1
what is this,Aberration,1
"""pvp""",Arixama,1
That's probably why haha,Aberration,1
I can't wait to try it honestly.,Arixama,1
"I mean I hate PvP with a passion in D2, but Gambit is just too much fun. You have those crazy moments where you take down someone during an invade who's looking to bank 15 motes, total team wipe, or both teams doing this crazy damage race through the Primeval's health bar. I love it.",Oathbreaker,1
"It also gives me incentives to get better at PvP, so I can become a much more effective Invader and not just be a defender.",Oathbreaker,1
"Additionally, it's a fast paced and frantic mode that it's chaos in the best of ways.",Oathbreaker,1
anyone interested in helping me get the wotw tonight?,storyteller,1
hey @storyteller sorry I was busy today! Im not 100% sure of my schedule tomorrow but if we are both on at some point I would be more than happy to help,Trissin,1
"@Trissin Thanks! Tomorrow I won't be able to play at all, I have some family plans. I'll be back Monday though",storyteller,1
"I can probably lend a hand on Monday as well, will be on and off all day",Aberration,1
also - LFG Nightfall need to run it on 2 chars,Aberration,1
I can hope on for a quick NF,Masrim,1
"So if anyone wants to go for anything, I'm down!",RonInDune,1
Just got back. If NF is a thing I still need it @Masrim im @RonInDune,Aberration,1
Sure I'll join in,RonInDune,1
SO turns out the nightfall doesn;t unlock if you don't log out and back in in somce cases. Interesting.,RonInDune,1
Anybody want to do one last  raid later before forsaken drops tomorrow?,Arixama,1
Heck yeah!,RonInDune,1
"Looking for about 6 half hours from now, but anytime after that I can do too.",Arixama,1
"Yup, that's good enough for me as well.",RonInDune,1
@here anyone else up for a raid later today?,Arixama,1
What raid are we gonna bully?,Oathbreaker,1
Anything works for me.,Arixama,1
Eater was the easiest for me. Though prestige Levi was pretty fun too.,RonInDune,1
Is @Trissin  available?,RonInDune,1
I think it just depends on how much time people want to put in.,Arixama,1
"hey! i'd love to do a raid today, although I have a few things to do at 10pm ET (7pm PT)
not entirely sure how long it will last, but I should be back on around 11 ET",Trissin,1
I am free anytime before that 👍,Trissin,1
Sounds like we've got four? @RonInDune @Trissin @Oathbreaker,Arixama,1
"I'm a maybe. Got college orientation tomorrow so I do need to get things ready for Wednesday classes. We get a group, I'll definitely try to join for a while.",Oathbreaker,1
"depending on the time, Id be in as well",Sabre,1
"I might be a bit iffy on the time as well, I've got to head out for a bit right now and I am not too sure when I will be back. Don't hesitate to replace or start without me! (sorry in advance !)",Trissin,1
@PC How is everybody enjoying forsaken?????,Trissin,1
Only played a bit but enjoy it a lot!  And bows are amazing\,Peronix,1
its been a lot of fun so far,Sabre,1
just been doing story with @zetaa,Sabre,1
we're about to jump into Gambit,Sabre,1
good!! i just started as well,Trissin,1
and ive been having a ton of fun,Trissin,1
its really good,Trissin,1
ugh another update?,Masrim,1
guess I don't play tonight lol,Masrim,1
Super super fun for me. Damn college having to start the same day though hahaha.,Oathbreaker,1
I love the new area!,RonInDune,1
the bow is super bad ass,AY AY RON,1
Forsaken story finished! Max level! Good day!,Thawxtem,1
Yasssss to everything,Aberration,1
I hate you all for having time to play,Masrim,1
I was busy yesterday and barely played ahhh,Trissin,1
The bow feels real nice. At least the one I got.,Arixama,1
It's got timed payload,Arixama,1
!loadout,Trissin,1
This one? The one from Petra?,Trissin,1
Yup,Arixama,1
"""no turning back""",Trissin,1
I want to play so bad,Trissin,1
"I'm lucky I only have a few classes this morning, I'll have the afternoon to play :))",Trissin,1
Do we know the recommended light for the raid?,Arixama,1
i dont think it's been announced yet,Trissin,1
although I really want to get a team together and try it blind,Trissin,1
would you guys be interested in that?,Trissin,1
"we can put it off a little bit, since I imagine the light requirement will probably be pretty high",Trissin,1
and we will need some time to reach it,Trissin,1
let's do it blind!,Trissin,1
Thawxtem and I are 500 already so we are down,Helatia,1
"Gimmie, our new guy and one of my friends, isnt far behind that either",Helatia,1
!loadout,Helatia,1
oh nooooooooooo memory of cayde,Trissin,1
:c,Trissin,1
"but anyway that's awesome helatia, if we have the people at high enough light then we should definitely give it a try",Trissin,1
"I'm 501 and working on getting higher, but I'd definitely be down.",Arixama,1
Same. Working on the legendary engrams and powerful ones to up that light,Helatia,1
"@PC If anyone wants help, or just an extra hand, with the story tonight feel free to message me.",Helatia,1
I'll be on after 9 central,Helatia,1
WHen does the raid drop?,RonInDune,1
The 14th,Arixama,1
"Oh I have the weekend to max out power, that's good",RonInDune,1
"Honestly If I had to guess, recommended power will probably be 570 or so",Arixama,1
Oh crap I'm out of town when the raid drops,Arixama,1
"I'd love to try the new raid, but I've only ever completed Leviathan once, and I'm curious if it would be a whole lot easier at 500. I'd love to try it a few more times, at least once, before the new one comes out if anyone would like to help.",Thawxtem,1
"yeah, we should take you through EOW, Spire, and the prestige raids",Trissin,1
could probably double as training to lvl 50,Thawxtem,1
Id be down to do any and all. I super want to test out bows and stuff,Arixama,1
ohhhhhhhhh that's going to be a lot of fun I imagine,Trissin,1
"I'll be interested to see them on gauntlet, to see if they stick around on the buttons.",Arixama,1
I doubt it though.,Arixama,1
"When would you be available? I’m off the rest of today, tomorrow, and Saturday",Thawxtem,1
I'm available tonight after like 6ish. Then Thursday and Friday.,Arixama,1
Gimmie will be on after 7ish and I will be on after 9ish,Helatia,1
What do we want to run if we do?,Arixama,1
"As I said, I’ve only done it once, so I’m not sure about the 3rd yet",Thawxtem,1
So either leviathan or eow would probably be good.,Arixama,1
And it sounds like we've got 4 depending on times.,Arixama,1
"I think EOW sounds great, shouldn't take too long either",Trissin,1
we'll see who's available at around 7pm ET (6 CT),Trissin,1
"Trissin, Arixama, Helatia, Thawxtem, and two more, yes?",Thawxtem,1
Helatia said Gimmie will be available... but I don't think i've played with him/her before,Trissin,1
I was with him doing forsaken story last night,Thawxtem,1
"Just joined guild, or tried to",Thawxtem,1
I'm available THrusday/Firday evening!,RonInDune,1
You got your times wrong @Trissin,Arixama,1
6 CT is 7 ET,Arixama,1
crap,Trissin,1
my bad,Trissin,1
sorry haha,Trissin,1
holy carp the adventures in the expansion are awesome!,RonInDune,1
May be too early for Helatia. He said around 9 CST,Thawxtem,1
Curious to see if everyone from the raid talk is playing right now,Thawxtem,1
Anybody want to run the nightfall?,Trissin,1
"Just for completion, not a score run",Trissin,1
What's the power requirement?,RonInDune,1
im in,Arixama,1
Recommended 540 but I'm gonna be going in around 510,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
Welp 1'm 502,RonInDune,1
"if i could get help finishing up this heroic adventure, that'd be swell",Arixama,1
yeah absolutely ill join in,Trissin,1
"Good luck,, brave warriors",RonInDune,1
"also ron 502 is fine, things will just hurt a lot",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"Hey guys sorry for rushing out at hte end, my roommate came in and wanted to talk",RonInDune,1
Tanks for a great nightfall though!,RonInDune,1
"No worries at all, it's all good 👍",Trissin,1
That was quite the nightfall,Trissin,1
I had fun tho,Trissin,1
apparently this is how levelling your light level works now: https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e2l75/the_power_leveling_system_has_been_changed/,AY AY RON,1
"Definitely seems like it. I'm only getting a few power boosts now from powerful engrams. I don't remember what my clan xp engram dropped at last night, but I think it was 520 something",Arixama,1
"ohh, I didn't know about this, thank you!",Trissin,1
I'm at 519 currently,Arixama,1
im at 511,Trissin,1
SO getting to 600 will be a nightmare,RonInDune,1
"also, i need to do some gambit + crucible + EP with clanmates so if anybody else needs that, hmu",Trissin,1
Heck yeah I'm down later tonight,RonInDune,1
Do we know that the ep drop is this week?,Arixama,1
"im not sure, sorry]",Trissin,1
Max gambit rank is 15000 points.,Arixama,1
Also if we can get 4 for gambit later we should try to go for the secret triumph,Arixama,1
the 60 mega-drop thing?,Trissin,1
its an emblem right?,Trissin,1
Yup.,Arixama,1
"This week ep drop is sniper, next week is all",Arixama,1
ah ok,Trissin,1
"i dont think we have to finish it, just clear 3 waves",Trissin,1
If we've got the people we should finish it though. I know I don't have any of the weapons.,Arixama,1
yeah i guess we may as well just do it haha,Trissin,1
"remember the weapons arent guaranteed drop though, it's rng",Trissin,1
I didn't realize that they drop from the boss and not the locked chest.,Arixama,1
"yeah, they come from the boss",Trissin,1
it's quite common to try and 'farm' the boss by failing level 7 intentionally,Trissin,1
Like killing it at the last possible second right? So it dies and drops loot but technically you've failed,Arixama,1
"I need to do the 10 EP level clears for a quest, so that'd be excellent",RonInDune,1
Nascent dawn?,Arixama,1
yup yup,RonInDune,1
IS geomag stabilizers a forsaken exotic?,RonInDune,1
I don't recognize the name so probably.,Arixama,1
Does it have the forsaken emblem in the corner?,Arixama,1
"Cool, so losing 5 crucible matches in a row was worth something",RonInDune,1
Oh yeah it does now that I check,RonInDune,1
Silver linings!,Arixama,1
what's geomag stabilizers,Trissin,1
whaat,Trissin,1
yes apparently its a new set of warlock boots,Trissin,1
Yeah give us those perk details!,Arixama,1
oh no woops,RonInDune,1
Geomag exotic,RonInDune,1
OH MY GOD GIMME,Arixama,1
Start losing in the crucible,RonInDune,1
I want chromatic fire really though.,Arixama,1
Adds elemental explosions to precision kills I believe.,Arixama,1
And it stacks with ace,Arixama,1
wait wut,Trissin,1
hows that gonna work,Trissin,1
double explosions??,Trissin,1
haha,Trissin,1
Triple actually.,Arixama,1
triple??,Trissin,1
._.,Trissin,1
Firefly and chromatic fire has an immediate and a timed,Arixama,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9e288e/ace_of_spades_chromatic_fire_fatebringer_on/?utm_source=reddit-android,Arixama,1
wait what chromatic fire has _two_ explosions_???,Trissin,1
Apparently.,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
I think bungie just wanted explosions for everything.,Arixama,1
hahaha,Trissin,1
"Explosive arrows, dragonfly and firefly, chromatic fire, two tailed fox.",Arixama,1
Everything,Arixama,1
"yep, yeah",Trissin,1
lots of explosions haha,Trissin,1
_what if you could roll dragonfly on a bow_,Trissin,1
I have it on subtle calamity.,Arixama,1
wait what,Trissin,1
serious,Trissin,1
Yeah.,Arixama,1
"_oh hey banshee, how's it going, i've got these 6000 gunsmith materials here_",Trissin,1
Haha,Arixama,1
I was using it during the nightfall and heroic adventure.,Arixama,1
I have to get me one of those,Trissin,1
it sounds amazing,Trissin,1
It's real good.,Arixama,1
Better than no turning back.,Arixama,1
honestly I havent noticed much of a difference between the two bows,Trissin,1
With dragonfly it's just good cause it does the aoe on precision,Arixama,1
Plus it let's me use perfect paradox when I want to,Arixama,1
"yeah, it's a good balance of different ranges and DPS",Trissin,1
Guys what's the best way to grind out advanced paradox amplifiers?,RonInDune,1
Crucible or strikes,Arixama,1
Try and double up on something else you need to do,Arixama,1
OK yeah that sounds easier then the heroic story missions I've been doing,RonInDune,1
"Especially if you just hop into a normal strike on the map. Xol is a pretty easy one. If you need taken kills too, run Lake of shadows on earth.",Arixama,1
"Depending on the story mission, I don't think they are too bad",Trissin,1
I ran the Warmind mission on Earth 3x for the weekly milestone pretty fast,Trissin,1
"But definitely multitask if you can, go for something that will net multiple objectives at once",Trissin,1
like ari suggested,Trissin,1
Yeah that's a good plan. I dislike the mercure heroics anyway,RonInDune,1
It's heroic adventures right?,Arixama,1
yup,RonInDune,1
I'm which were you running?,Arixama,1
I was doing all 3 available on mercury again and again,RonInDune,1
The runner is the easiest one by far.,Arixama,1
It's just the run up through the infinite forest that's boring,RonInDune,1
Yeah it's awful.,Arixama,1
What time are we looking at for EP @Trissin,Arixama,1
"ou, I don't know",Trissin,1
let me check the boss this week,Trissin,1
The one you shoot in the back,Arixama,1
ohh the ogre right?,Trissin,1
Yup,Arixama,1
"alright that one isn't too bad, i think we can do it with at least 5",Trissin,1
@PC is anybody interested in doing some escalation protocol today?,Trissin,1
im down for EP,AY AY RON,1
"I would prefer later in the evening, but otherwise I'm available as well",RonInDune,1
I can get on  whenever.,Arixama,1
"awesome, that's 4 people",Trissin,1
"who knows, maybe some randoms will join us along the way",Trissin,1
when are you free @AY AY RON and @RonInDune,Trissin,1
How many do we need? I've had a devil of time doing it with 3 people,RonInDune,1
I'm down post 8 PM Central,RonInDune,1
anytime after 8pm est,AY AY RON,1
okay so it sounds like around 9pm EST which is 8pm CT,Trissin,1
@PC EP?,Trissin,1
Yeah I'll need around 15 more minutes unfortunately,RonInDune,1
"okay no worries, just let us know'",Trissin,1
im in gameso just shoot me a whisper when we're ready,Arixama,1
unless we want to try and start finding an instance,Arixama,1
im ready whenever as well,AY AY RON,1
:S,Trissin,1
"I am in voice for EP, everybody welcome! @PC",Trissin,1
Got any more room for EP?,Peronix,1
Is anyone free Tuesday? I’m at the point of begging to do a Leviathan eow and/or sos for the first time. I’ve only been able to be in the first one once and would love more of the Leviathan drops before nobody at all wants to do it anymore.,Thawxtem,1
"omg everybody left, so sorry thawxtem",Trissin,1
i'll be around tuesday,Arixama,1
"I think I should be free on tuesday night, id love to do all the raids with u @Thawxtem",Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Tuesday night's good for me too!,RonInDune,1
i want to run at least lev and eow before the new raid comes out,Arixama,1
"okay, yeah, lets do it",Trissin,1
Heck yeah,RonInDune,1
what time?,Arixama,1
How about 8 CST?,Thawxtem,1
Im in as well,Peronix,1
That’s 5. 1 more.,Thawxtem,1
Let me see if I'm raiding in wow first.  If I'm not I should be able to do Lev and SoS as well,TheCnC,1
When will you know?,Arixama,1
by the end of the day.  It's going to depend on the warfront today if I can get my drop from there or not.,TheCnC,1
Oh God there's another hidden gambit triumph called protect the runner. Requires 100 motes deposited by a single person without losing one.,Arixama,1
Is it over multiple games? I thought 75 summoned the primeval,Thawxtem,1
Single game. There's at least 2 rounds per match.,Arixama,1
And you have to win.,Arixama,1
https://m.imgur.com/a/znLyXJt,Arixama,1
I can get rid of all my old armor right?  no need for it anymore?,Masrim,1
"Yeah, unless you like it.",Arixama,1
anyone up for Gambit? we need 1 more. trying to get the secret triumphs,Sabre,1
I'm good for tuesday,TheCnC,1
"So we've got @Thawxtem , @TheCnC , @Arixama , @Peronix, @Trissin and @RonInDune?",Arixama,1
Need to make sure we have a time; no one responded when I suggested my time,Thawxtem,1
@RonInDune @Peronix @Trissin @TheCnC what time works for everybody?,Arixama,1
"Anytime after 8 CST.
I can stretch to 7:30 CST in a pinch.",RonInDune,1
"I would still prefer around 8 CST like I said, mainly to make sure my day is done, dinner is out of the way, and I won't have any distractions",Thawxtem,1
I'm good whenever,TheCnC,1
I'm down for 8 CST or later,Peronix,1
OK why are half the places in the dreaming city literally off the map? I'm in the Spine of Keres and the map isn't showing me at all...,RonInDune,1
"Also, the COnfluence is super spooky",RonInDune,1
I explored there and made a map last night. I see it as a fast travel across the dreaming city with all the final portal destinations. Only one was dangerous because it dropped you in the middle of a taken swarm,Thawxtem,1
Oh that makes sense.,RonInDune,1
Are you there now? I'm fixing to get on and wouldn't mind a buddy in the dreaming city,Thawxtem,1
"Nah I just left, I did the Blind Well Tier 3 a bunch of times with randoms and I'm all destinied out for now. 

It's such a cool place, just wish I was higher level.",RonInDune,1
bummer. Nobody's around whenever I visit. I've visited several times,Thawxtem,1
Aw dang. We should get the clan group together for the event. It needs a lot of people to be successful.,RonInDune,1
It would be amazing if we had multiple clan fireteams in the same dreaming city server,Thawxtem,1
Yeah the clan features are severely lacking. Takes forever to get a group for Escalation Protocol as well,RonInDune,1
Never actually done EP before. I can't start it for some reason even after completing the Warmind story,Thawxtem,1
"if you go in slowly, the game has time to match you with other people",Arixama,1
go in slowly?,Thawxtem,1
"yeah, like crouch walk",Arixama,1
"...sorry, but I'm lost on how that fits in. Unless I'm thinking of something else",Thawxtem,1
"EP is Mars event activated by squares, yes?",Thawxtem,1
i mean fir blind well,Arixama,1
To anyone playing right now: I would love some help with getting through the Ascendant Challenge quest in dreaming city. All you need is Tincture of Queensfoil and probably a shotgun.,Thawxtem,1
oh I need to do that as well,Trissin,1
do u think we could 2 man it?,Trissin,1
cuz im pretty sure if u die you cant get back in,Trissin,1
"Enemies don’t shoot at you, you just need to keep running.",Thawxtem,1
yeah but those big knight do a **lot** of damage,Trissin,1
once i finish this gambit match i can join you guys,Arixama,1
Jump in the trees and they can’t get you,Thawxtem,1
https://www.tenor.co/TMql.gif,Trissin,1
@Trissin you going to hop on?,Arixama,1
"Yeah, a trick for getting more people in your instance of Blind Well is to slow down going into the transition zone.",Oathbreaker,1
"It's a trick that's been around since The Taken King with the Court of Oryx, and was also used in Rise of Iron with Archon's Forge. Basically, what happens is if you move too quickly through the transition zone (The hallway leading to The Blind Well in this case, just before you reach the new zone and the name of the zone comes up), the game will not have enough time to matchmake you into a zone with other players.",Oathbreaker,1
"If you slow down, by either walking slowly, crouch walking, or moving through slowly on your sparrow, you'll give the game more time to matchmake and will be more likely to group up with others. It's not 100% effective, but it's definitely a way to improve your matchmaking ability.",Oathbreaker,1
lol Archon's Forge,Trissin,1
"sorry somehow I missed that notification last night @Arixama , but I'm free to do ascendent challenge today
@Thawxtem",Trissin,1
"I ran him through it last night, but I can help help you through it.",Arixama,1
"Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome, ty",Trissin,1
im good whenever,Arixama,1
👍,Trissin,1
im online @Arixama,Trissin,1
been trying to solo it for the last 15 minutes,Trissin,1
Had to run out for food quick. Will hop on asap,Arixama,1
What's your loadout?,Arixama,1
actually i might have it here,Trissin,1
give me a min,Trissin,1
"yep, i got it",Trissin,1
im okay now haha,Trissin,1
thank u tho!,Trissin,1
Yeah it's not awful.,Arixama,1
"i was trying to run around and shotgun everything, problems occured when I ran out of ammo",Trissin,1
and if you die then the whole room gets reset,Trissin,1
eventually i figured out you can just camp on a tree and nothing can hit you....,Trissin,1
"I ran a shotgun, pulse and whisper. If I ran out of shotgun ammo I killed some shadow thrall to get ammo back. Once I popped all the blights I camped on a tree and took out the crystals with whisper",Arixama,1
"i ran a few tries in which I didnt camp on any trees, I just ran around with 2 shotguns and a grenade launcher",Trissin,1
when i ran out of ammo i had to melee some thrall without getting one-shot by the knights,Trissin,1
I almost had it one or two times,Trissin,1
was not fun.,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"The first time I actually got the chest to spawn it glitched and when I ran up to grab the chest, Knights spawned and murdered me about halfway through the collect loot wheel.",Arixama,1
And then I was locked out.,Arixama,1
THE SAME THING ALMOST HAPPENED TO ME,Trissin,1
I was like 3ft from the chest and everything spawned again,Trissin,1
"i panicked, opened the chest and got the fuck outta there",Trissin,1
I just gave up for the night and had oath help me with it later.,Arixama,1
"I don’t see why you wasted Whisper ammo, the crystals were a one-shot with a bow",Thawxtem,1
Save it for knights or a backup shotgun I say,Thawxtem,1
I had two shotguns the first time 🤣,Arixama,1
Gave me a sniper I could sit in a tree with that I was used to.,Arixama,1
Since we've got so many people online... does anybody want to do Eater of Worlds @PC ?,Trissin,1
I can in just a bit,TheCnC,1
I’m down,Peronix,1
Eyyy,Peronix,1
How soon we looking to start?,Arixama,1
as soon as we can,Trissin,1
as soon as we  get 6 people lol,Trissin,1
sabre and zeta said they can join as well,Trissin,1
Ok coming on now,TheCnC,1
"I am on my way home, so if you don't get anyone before I get home, I'll join.",Arixama,1
i think thawxtem is going to join,Trissin,1
ari if you would prefer to go that's fine.  I was just saying I was available to fill if needed,TheCnC,1
I’m in,Thawxtem,1
Is Trissin leader?,Thawxtem,1
"Sure, you can join up on me now",Trissin,1
Need to switch characters,Thawxtem,1
no worries,Trissin,1
@TheCnC you done eater of world's ever?,Arixama,1
nope but it's ok if you want in,TheCnC,1
Nah you do it. You need the experience.,Arixama,1
ok lol,TheCnC,1
"if you guys need someone, just hit me up. im in for the night.",Arixama,1
@Trissin @Thawxtem @Peronix @TheCnC @RonInDune we still doing raids today @ 8cst?,Arixama,1
Yep,TheCnC,1
Roger,Peronix,1
Yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
Yes,Thawxtem,1
"I might be a bit late, sorry in advance",Trissin,1
"oh wait, nevermind, i confused ct and et",Trissin,1
I'll be on,Trissin,1
@Trissin @Arixama @Peronix @TheCnC @RonInDune reminder: Raid in 50 minutes. I’ll be waiting in orbit at that time,Thawxtem,1
Yup yup,RonInDune,1
Which raid are we doing? Leviathan or spire or prestige or,Trissin,1
:p,Trissin,1
"We could do spire, I like the difficulty.",RonInDune,1
"alright, spire it is",Trissin,1
"Yay! spire is the only one I haven’t done, so this will finish my trio!",Thawxtem,1
Who will be the fire team leader?,Thawxtem,1
"I don't think it really matters all too much, as long as we are in the same fireteam",Trissin,1
"forewarning however, spire can be a bit of a communication challenge",Trissin,1
How so?,Thawxtem,1
"I would say that spire has one of the most mechanically challenging boss fights in all of destiny, including d1",Trissin,1
"there are just so many mechanics, and lots of communication is required",Trissin,1
"buffs, symbols, and locations that need to be called out",Trissin,1
So more skill in cooperation than power level?,Thawxtem,1
"I guess it's hard to say what's _more_ and whats _less_, but you will definitely have to be paying attention to whats going on while dealing with lots of ads",Trissin,1
"the issue before was that it was a high power level, but we shouldnt have that problem now",Trissin,1
"anyway, I think you'll see what I mean when we get into the encounters",Trissin,1
it sounds way harder than it actually is,Arixama,1
I just hope it isn't a disappointment like EoW was,Thawxtem,1
wut,Trissin,1
"EoW seemed a little too easy. Idk if it was power level, but I liked Leviathan better",Thawxtem,1
"ah. well, EOW is a raid _lair_ , meaning its supposed to be a lot shorter",Trissin,1
"and I agree with you on that it was a bit easy, but that was probably due to the fact we have whisper of the worm now",Trissin,1
whisper is just so overpowered...,Trissin,1
especially at 500...,Thawxtem,1
i don't think we would've had enough damage to take him down on that first run without whisper,Trissin,1
"and also, for shooting argos' weak spots, 2 or 3 whisper shots does it",Trissin,1
"it used to be everyone with coldheart or valakadyn or something just screaming ""SHOOT THE ARM SHOOT THE ARM SHOOT IT""",Trissin,1
it was kind of stressful at first haha,Trissin,1
Let's go ahead and go to voice chat to take up less discord space,Thawxtem,1
I remember you guys totally faked me out with the ending when I did it. Thought I was gonna die when I started getting pulled out.,RonInDune,1
lool,Trissin,1
sorry ron!,Trissin,1
"the actual encounters in eow are pretty easy, but the locations and everything else are what i really enjoyed about it",Arixama,1
"^
solar side is *pretty*",Trissin,1
arc side is a little more meh,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
Give me a second my internet literally just died.,Arixama,1
"~~lol ofc no worries~~ @Arixama

damn too bad for u we gon 5 man it now",Trissin,1
Are we joining up on Trissin?,RonInDune,1
Yep,Trissin,1
"Raid chat, yes?",Thawxtem,1
@Thawxtem we can hear you,Trissin,1
you can't hear us? @Thawxtem,Trissin,1
"Alright, I think it's time to start putting together a team to tackle Last Wish _blind_ !",Trissin,1
I'm still way too low level sadly. I can't get over 515 somehow.,RonInDune,1
My best stuff gets me to around 520,Thawxtem,1
"Yeah, it's really hard to level after 500",Trissin,1
I am gonna go ahead and guess the power requirement will be 550,Trissin,1
"Oh wow, are you  at 550 or thereabouts already?",RonInDune,1
nonono im not even close haha,Trissin,1
but I think we should gather a team and figure out a date depending on how fast we level,Trissin,1
"currently, the nightfall is the best way of levelling up a character",Trissin,1
"Also, if we are going to do it blind, we have to take _every precaution_ not to follow any updates on twitch, youtube, reddit, etc",Trissin,1
"anyway, i just wanted to get an idea of who might be interested in doing it blind",Trissin,1
Everything I know is this: ?,Thawxtem,1
once we are ready of course,Trissin,1
"i would love to be a part of it, im not sure exactly what power level ill be when it drops though. probably will be a bit over 520. willing to stay off the internet in preparation haha",zetaa,1
"I think just 520+ should be good enough for the first few encounters at least, I don't expect us to finish it",Trissin,1
Unless you guys do it on Monday I won't be around.,Arixama,1
noo ari!,Trissin,1
we can push it back,Trissin,1
gives us more time to level anyway,Trissin,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Trissin,1
I'm out of town and away from internet access until late Sunday night.,Arixama,1
I'm sure mobile data works fine for online gaming.,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
Unfortunately I don't have a wifi card for my pc 😭,Arixama,1
"don't worry about it, we can push the date back a bit",Trissin,1
Plus I'd rather not drag my desktop across 2 states. 🤣,Arixama,1
lol,Trissin,1
"If you guys end up doing it without me, my only request is for screenshots.",Arixama,1
"well we'll see how it goes - how many people are interested, raiding experience, power level, free time, etc",Trissin,1
"That being said, if anyone wants to help me out with this week's ascendant challenge later today that'd be great.",Arixama,1
"absolutely, let's do it together",Trissin,1
I'd love to!\,Thawxtem,1
"while we're at this we can also do gambit, crucible, other clan stuff",Trissin,1
I actually need to kill 4 of the knights there for the better mod for the dreaming city gear,Thawxtem,1
maybe some escalation protocol as well,Trissin,1
Awesome. what time are you guys around?,Arixama,1
wait u need to kill them??,Trissin,1
I am actually free atm,Trissin,1
I can get on now,Thawxtem,1
I won't be home until around 630.st,Arixama,1
Cst,Arixama,1
so about an hour and 15,Trissin,1
Yeah,Arixama,1
"I think I should be good then, but honestly I can't say for sure at this point",Trissin,1
"@Trissin after giving an offering to the machine, you get a quest to kill 4 there and fix the curse half of the armor",Thawxtem,1
If thawxtem is on you should go ahead and do it with him,Trissin,1
"oh I haven't turned in that bounty yet, im waiting to turn in 3 at once",Trissin,1
"I'm leaving tomorrow morning, so I'm trying to get as much done as I can before I go.",Arixama,1
gotcha,Trissin,1
The quest you get from the oracle has different requirements.,Arixama,1
Ascendant challenge will be weekly #3 for me,Thawxtem,1
"gotcha. well, that was my quest this time",Thawxtem,1
"Yeah, the one I have requires a plague of the well killed while ascendant",Arixama,1
"@Arixama I'm getting on now. If you care to do ascendant challenge, join me in general chat",Thawxtem,1
i thought he still needed like an hour,Trissin,1
until he's home,Trissin,1
"oh, misread. sorry",Thawxtem,1
"That's Ok, there was a lot being said in a short amount of time.",Arixama,1
alright im hopping on now,Arixama,1
i suppose ill get on too,Trissin,1
"You guys ever see the small ball of light in the challenge? I got a daily quest to find it again, so please help me keep an eye out for it",Thawxtem,1
i dont know what you are talking about,Trissin,1
its the toland  balls,Arixama,1
^,Thawxtem,1
Just pulled a Borealis from Ikora's engram. So. So. SO. Fucking. Happy.,Oathbreaker,1
Bungie is apparently offering a jacket to people who complete the raid before Tuesday.  So anyone feel like tying the raid  tomorrow night?,Peronix,1
"I would, but my Light level is garbage and I have to be up super early the next day",TheCnC,1
oooooh,Trissin,1
we can see how many people we've got,Trissin,1
I know Arixama is out of town,TheCnC,1
yeah,Trissin,1
"If you guys get the jacket he'll be impressed, and miffed at the same time lol.",TheCnC,1
But good luck to you all!,TheCnC,1
"Well, if we ever get 6 people, I can do it at 8:30 CST.  Until then, I gotta get my guardian some gains",Peronix,1
"Whoaaa, there are more rewards",Trissin,1
If you complete the raid in the first 24 hours you get an emblem as well,Trissin,1
"and then the world's first team are all guaranteed the ""one thousand voices"" exotic weapon",Trissin,1
the laser with the delayed explosion,Trissin,1
It looks like you only need to be 520 to enter but it will be recommended 550,Trissin,1
im so freaking hypedddd,Trissin,1
im down to try to tackle it early. would love the jacket tbh haha,zetaa,1
IT'S OUTTT,Trissin,1
2 more classes to go 😢,zetaa,1
ive muted like every D2 channel and am probably unsubbing from the subreddit until we do our run haha. im taking this too seriously,zetaa,1
"I'm doing a blind run tomorrow so I'm in like full ""NO ONE TELLS ME ANYTHING"" mode",Oathbreaker,1
"Raid's out figure I might check out the light level requirement...sees it's 550...""Nope not going to be able to touch that for a while"" lol",TheCnC,1
Is it 550? That's gonna be rough for me then jesus.,Oathbreaker,1
Are any of you 550?,RonInDune,1
It is 550,TheCnC,1
Nope,Oathbreaker,1
Very few people in the world are 550 and up,Oathbreaker,1
I'm max 534.,Arixama,1
So looks like all my time spending collecting lore instead of increasing light might not have been the best choice,RonInDune,1
"i feel that so much, i need those triumphs",zetaa,1
It's also like pretty rng heavy though. I've gotten pretty lucky getting the things I need to increase my light.,Arixama,1
"yeah absolutely. definitely need to finish my engram challenges still, have been slacking on nightfall",zetaa,1
Nightfall is rough right now.,Arixama,1
I can't even imagine trying to go for a high score run.,Arixama,1
NF is super rough right now but I still need to do it for something at the very least.,Oathbreaker,1
Gotta try to edge out those 3 LL hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
"Hopefully I'll have gambit, heroic story and crucible milestone to do when I get home.",Arixama,1
yeah definitely wouldn't be able to get that high score engram but it's possible to beat it (after bashing your head against a wall for too long),zetaa,1
I still have to do heroic story I think,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, Ron trissin and I did it last week.",Arixama,1
Supposedly they put in a hotfix to fix the bugged reset from Saturday. Can anyone confirm  that?,Arixama,1
yep. the challenges are now up,zetaa,1
was nice to see all the icons pop up on a thursday haha,zetaa,1
Phenomenal,Arixama,1
Yeah it,Oathbreaker,1
It's fixed *,Oathbreaker,1
So I no longer am raiding tomorrow lmfao.,Oathbreaker,1
One guy in the group saw the first encounter,Oathbreaker,1
"Like the LL, and just basically said, welp, more than half of us won't be able to do any damage",Oathbreaker,1
what LL are you?,zetaa,1
527,Oathbreaker,1
Who was in the group that wanted to do raid blind? when are we doing it? I'd like to get my hands on that jacket,Thawxtem,1
"Okay, I'd just like to get into the raid asap, so whenever you get on and want to do raid, please @ me and join my fireteam. When we have 6, we'll go into new Raid",Thawxtem,1
"I would love to go into the raid blind, but i won't be able to until tonight",Peronix,1
I'm not available until monday,Arixama,1
nightfall anybody? @PC,Trissin,1
i got kicked @Thawxtem @AY AY RON,Trissin,1
signing back in now,Trissin,1
Has any player beaten the raid yet?,Peronix,1
Nope,Helatia,1
@PC  Anybody want to do fresh Leviathian? Need 1,Helatia,1
!triumphs,Helatia,1
!score,Helatia,1
!triumphs,Thawxtem,1
"Guys I tried the ascendant challenge and I just couldn't do it. Is 520 too low, or are the end knights just hard?",RonInDune,1
I think those knights are just pretty strong lol,Trissin,1
yeah i cheesed it by repeatedly thundercrashing into the well of light at like 520,zetaa,1
"lol, i think the other way is to just find a tree to camp in",Trissin,1
you are literally invincible as long as you are not on the ground',Trissin,1
nothing can hurt u,Trissin,1
"Oh that's a good tip, I'll be trying that next. i just wish it didn't need the consumable every time.",RonInDune,1
Anyone down to attempt The Last Wish tomorrow? Probably won't get too far but it seems like a good time,Peronix,1
if we wanted to get a group together im good past like 3pm CST,zetaa,1
will prob be only 533 or so,zetaa,1
@Arixama ?,Trissin,1
"Ended up getting delayed and won't be home until sometime tomorrow, but if I'm not home too late definitely.",Arixama,1
"I haven't played enough and am still at 522, I could join in if I won't be a liability.",RonInDune,1
we'll see if we can get through the first encounter,Trissin,1
Let's do it then!,RonInDune,1
what time are we looking at trying the raid?,Arixama,1
when will u be back??,Trissin,1
I am already back,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
Yup,Arixama,1
I can be ready whenever,Arixama,1
I'll be in around 3 - 3:30 CST.,RonInDune,1
I have classes until 8 ET (7 CT),Trissin,1
"We can start then, that's good for me.",RonInDune,1
who else is joining us? @Peronix @zetaa @Thawxtem @Oathbreaker interested?,Trissin,1
if there are too many people i will step out,Trissin,1
Good for me too.,Arixama,1
"I’m down, but I won’t be able to get on until 8:30 CT cause work just called me in.",Peronix,1
"8:30 CST is about when id be all set as well, i have an hour long meeting at 7 that might run over a little",zetaa,1
No can do. College is keeping me busy now. Gotta do some projects tonight,Oathbreaker,1
@here we still attempting raid stuff tonight?,Arixama,1
If we got enough people. I don't know who's all ready,Peronix,1
@PC Last Wish ???,Trissin,1
Are we doing this?,Helatia,1
I would give it my honest best try...but I'm only 507,TheCnC,1
I'm 530,Helatia,1
"I mayy not be able to join, actually, because i just found out i have some work to do",Trissin,1
oh.. I think cnc might be a bit low,Trissin,1
I think minimum is 520,Peronix,1
^,Trissin,1
otherwise things will just be immune i think,Trissin,1
"If we don't have enough people, we can put it on for another night if that works for everyone",Peronix,1
I wasn't suggesting you actually take me.  Sorry if it seemed like I was saying otherwise,TheCnC,1
"so potentially we have @Peronix @Helatia and me, right?",Arixama,1
I think so,Peronix,1
@RonInDune @zetaa ?,Trissin,1
@Thawxtem,Helatia,1
"Just got off work today. Already ate, is there still time to join?",Thawxtem,1
I don't believe it's started yet,Trissin,1
"yep, we're still getting people together",Peronix,1
Gimmie is 528 and he is considering it,Helatia,1
"@RonInDune @zetaa
Last Wish?",Trissin,1
530 still shows skulls. We will get 1 shotted,Helatia,1
"really? dang, im 521",Peronix,1
"Oops sorry yeah, I don't have enough time to do it now",RonInDune,1
I went into the raid today morning and I got one shot constantly at the first encounter. I was 522.,RonInDune,1
You will need 540 minimum to get rid of skulls,Helatia,1
Y'all might gotta count me out then till I get a higher LL,Peronix,1
it's still fun to venture inside and figure out the mechanics,Trissin,1
That's true,Peronix,1
"sorry for the delay, im here now if we wanna try it",zetaa,1
Anyone want to try for EP weapons this week? All 3 are dropping off this boss cycle.,Aberration,1
i got the shotgun last night.,Arixama,1
Anyone still raid blind?,Sabre,1
"i am mostly. i went into it last night alone and took a look around, but thats it",Arixama,1

@here anyone up for a nightfall?,Arixama,1
yeah im down,zetaa,1
think we can do it with 2?,Arixama,1
"ooh, whats the nightfall this week",Trissin,1
"insight terminus, exodus crash and savathuns song",Arixama,1
im only 538 but i dont think thats too big of an issue. we can wait a lil bit for a third but im fine with trying 2,zetaa,1
only 538??,Trissin,1
538 aint lowwww,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
im 547 now,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
whoa,Trissin,1
im low in comparison lmao,zetaa,1
also the ascendant challenge is pretty easy this week,Arixama,1
oh good,Trissin,1
i think im going to do the nightfall milestone last,Trissin,1
since it awards the highest gear,Trissin,1
"im not sure what the order is supposed to be, ive heard that youre supposed to do dreaming city + nightfall first to get high gear and then the other activities will boost it by 1 or something? not sure",zetaa,1
i think dreaming city actually awards the highest gear,Arixama,1
cause its 560 or so,Arixama,1
your call though arixama we can wait or try it out. sabre might be on in a bit but hes mid 520 i think,zetaa,1
im on that destiny AND discord grind 😩,zetaa,1
we did it a couple weeks ago a a pretty low light and had a kind of rough time at it. but we did do it.,Arixama,1
"oh wait, dreaming city is 560?",Trissin,1
some areas for sure.,Arixama,1
i figure if us two are at or above the light level we can do it but it wont hurt with the third,zetaa,1
i mean dreaming city can award 560+ gear??,Trissin,1
i got a bunch of 550+,Arixama,1
because im thinking about how bungie said challenges will award gear based on how underlevelled you are,Trissin,1
like an hour ago,Arixama,1
i think there are large powerful drops up to 560 and then it starts to diminish after that,zetaa,1
like how the other powerful drops for activities stop rewarding as high light level,zetaa,1
🤔,Trissin,1
it's so confusing haha,zetaa,1
yeah,Trissin,1
there was a post about it on the subreddit a while back. that there are actually 3 tiers of powerful drops,zetaa,1
wanna give that nightfall a try?,Arixama,1
@zetaa,Arixama,1
yeah lemme finish this blind well run,zetaa,1
on the boss,zetaa,1
ok im ready,zetaa,1
what do we want to run?,Arixama,1
anything but exodus crash imo,zetaa,1
ill hop in the fireteam chat,zetaa,1
Anyone looking to grind EP today? I'm thinking I'll be around at 230est,Aberration,1
Might be more available for things in the next few days. Gonna try to get ahead of the curve on most of my classes. Got work on the weekend but with some luck I should be able to actually play some Destiny over the next few days.,Oathbreaker,1
Oh dang when did they change the ace of spades quest? Looks like you make progress by any handcannon kills not just invaders,RonInDune,1
yeah bungie changed it recently,Trissin,1
cuz people complain,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"Thursday, I think. It was in the latest hotfix.",Arixama,1
Praise bungo,RonInDune,1

what's the ascendent challenge this week?,Trissin,1
Jumping puzzle with bombs and a boss at the top.,Arixama,1
oh okay,Trissin,1
u can solo it?,Trissin,1
I did. Mostly a lot of jumping around the arena at the top.,Arixama,1
ok maybe ill try it,Trissin,1
Its a taken phalanx.,Arixama,1
Hey can anyone help me with this week's spider bounty? It's the fight in the EDZ,RonInDune,1
@PC  I will take people to a chest in the new raid if anyone wants it,Helatia,1
oooooh,Trissin,1
"Oh heck yeah, but i'm still 526",RonInDune,1
Hunters will need StompEs,Helatia,1
No combat nessicary,Helatia,1
Can warlocks do it?,RonInDune,1
If you can jump high enough lol,Helatia,1
Well no harm in trying!,RonInDune,1
Join in general,Helatia,1
It will take like 5 minutes,Helatia,1
already have the checkpoint,Helatia,1
@Trissin You want the chest?,Helatia,1
THat was indeed pretty cool. Thanks man!,RonInDune,1
@PC Doing another raid chest run for new raid. No combat needed. Anyone interested?,Helatia,1
I'd be up for it later.,Arixama,1
"Already grabbed it on my lock, no one else has the awoken key yet ;_;",Aberration,1
This is the bridge chest after first encounter,Helatia,1
Secret chest,Helatia,1
no key required,Helatia,1
I think he means the dreaming city key.,Arixama,1
"Oh, my bad",Helatia,1
Hey anyone up for a nightfall?,RonInDune,1
@PC nightfall anyone?,AY AY RON,1

"ooh, which weapon?",Trissin,1
The two tailed fox!,RonInDune,1
nice!!!! that's awesome,Trissin,1
I still dont' have any forsaken exotics 😢,Trissin,1
"I have the geomag stabilizers boots and this rocket launcher, both dropped from 500 power strikes",RonInDune,1
powerful rewards? or just random strike drops,Trissin,1
End of strike rewards both,RonInDune,1
i should start doing strikes more often,Trissin,1
Yeah they're surprisngly useful still,RonInDune,1
Zavala is a stingy bitch.,Arixama,1
he's keeping his gloves from me.,Arixama,1
Hey anyone up for trying the ascendant challenge with me? I keep getting knocked off by the end boss...,RonInDune,1

Anyone going to try for EP shotgun this week?,Aberration,1
I still want it ;_;,Aberration,1
"I wish I could help, I've been so busy with classes this week",Trissin,1
Me too...,RonInDune,1
Haven't played at all since last reset,Trissin,1
No worries fam. If you get time this weekend and want to crush it I'll be around,Aberration,1
"Huh I didn't realize you don't have to do the raid to get the third subclass. You can just present an offering to the oracle and visit [REDACTED] at [REDACTED], which is probably the prettiest place in the DLC so far.",RonInDune,1
"yeah, i was surprised to learn that as well",Trissin,1
i agree it looks amazing,Trissin,1
"there's also a hidden piece of lore there, did you pick it up?",Trissin,1
requires a bit of jumping,Trissin,1
Did not realize that the secondary perk on geo mags increase the length of chaos reach.,Arixama,1
They're even better than I thought,Arixama,1
rip i still havent gotten any forsaken exotics,Trissin,1
D:,Trissin,1
I honestly don't know where they came from. They just kind of showed up while i was playing gambit. I assume. I got An engram drop.,Arixama,1
"actually i think have opened a few exotics, but they are all Y1",Trissin,1
I pulled a prospector from a powerful gear bounty.,Arixama,1
It's felt less bad cause it was after i got the geomags,Arixama,1
lol,Trissin,1
so i guess now the question is geomags vs chromatic fire,Trissin,1
Geomags mostly. Depends on modifiers.,Arixama,1
"huh, interesting",Trissin,1
they're that good?,Trissin,1
Oh yeah those were some tricky jumps! I was so happy to find that I could actually make it over there,RonInDune,1

"Probably Eververse. When the game launched, it was not great.",Oathbreaker,1
"That, or being an online multiplayer that has content locked behind dlc.",Arixama,1

im at 522,Mr.Kaeron,1
"Whisper of the Worm is an amazing sniper power weapon, but it requires a quest to obtain. Completing the quest unlocks Heroic. The quest is only available on weekends, though, and can take a little bit of patience to get the right field requirements to spring the quest the first time",Thawxtem,1
oh I see,Mr.Kaeron,1
I dont think I have that quest tho,Mr.Kaeron,1
"It’s not on map, you have to kill a certain enemy during a certain public event to spawn a taken portal that leads to the quest",Thawxtem,1
"Join me if you want to try. Just remember, public events are random, so that’s where patience is required",Thawxtem,1
Just join the voice channel as well,Thawxtem,1

Hey I just realized I forgot to do this week's nightfall. Anyone available?,RonInDune,1

"Just caches, not mission. No spoilers!",Thawxtem,1
"Although, is it a solo mission?",Thawxtem,1
"I'm not sure honestly, I did it solo.",RonInDune,1
It is a solo mission,Arixama,1
Time to go to Banshee,Thawxtem,1

Well.. it's like the middle of the week,Trissin,1
Classes and work going on,Trissin,1
Is anyone willing to do the Corrupted dreaming city strike with me? I need a team who is willing to wait before doing stuff to get Ahamkara Bones,Thawxtem,1
HEck yeah I'm down. When do you want to do it?,RonInDune,1
Whenever,Thawxtem,1
I'm good Friday evening onwards.,RonInDune,1
Also Thursadya evening,RonInDune,1
"I was hoping today, but alright",Thawxtem,1
Hmm I can do today late,RonInDune,1
"Just rushing things, I suppose it doesn’t matter. How about we do it as a warm-up for Whisper Heroic 3?",Thawxtem,1
Oh that'd be good,RonInDune,1
I have to do it while ascended to get a Dreaming CIty mod,RonInDune,1
Just throw it on at final boss; bones are before then,Thawxtem,1
Cool Cool,RonInDune,1
I need the bones too. I've only done the strike once.,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune I have Helatia as our 3rd. Friday evening would be best.,Thawxtem,1
Perfect!,RonInDune,1
any1 would be willing to try and go for Whisper of the Worm?,Mr.Kaeron,1
@Mr.Kaeron You going for first or Heroic?,Thawxtem,1
never done it,Mr.Kaeron,1
so I assume first?,Mr.Kaeron,1
"1.) Quest is only available while Xur is here (aka weekends) 2.) I may be able to help, but I need to ask someone else",Thawxtem,1
I think you guys should be able to two-man it,Trissin,1
i would hop on and help as well but i've got lots of schoolwork...,Trissin,1
if you still need help i think i should be able to help over the weekend,Trissin,1
ahhhh,Mr.Kaeron,1

"also, im wondering if it's possible to get a raid going over the weekend",Trissin,1
"Gimme2, Helatia and I were talking about a raid group",Thawxtem,1

:kawaii:,Thawxtem,1
"oh yeah, kaeron, you should switch to NA!",Trissin,1
keep forgetting about that...,Thawxtem,1
to switch regions:,Trissin,1
First log out of blizzard client,Trissin,1
"Change regions on the login screen
_(if switching to EU, select europe)_",Trissin,1
"Finally, click the menu above the play button and choose your region
_(if switching to EU, select europe)_",Trissin,1
"After you boot up the game, it will take a bit of time before it displays all friends/clan members in the new region",Trissin,1
ahhhhhh,Mr.Kaeron,1
I think I didnt do the last bit,Mr.Kaeron,1
thanks @Trissin,Mr.Kaeron,1
No worries :((,Trissin,1
I might be able to rock a Levi run this weekend. Depends on timing...,Aberration,1
I can do one but not Saturday.,Arixama,1
"On a different note, who wants to make an Omelet with me? I'm fixing to start hunting wish-ender-bow-eggs and wanted to see if anyone cared to join",Thawxtem,1
Yeah I'm down for Levi!,RonInDune,1
"Lizard, Mr.Kaeron, Aberration, Arixama, RonInDune, Thawxtem...
We have 6 people for Levi possibly if we could just set up a time and test Kaeron’s server to make sure he can connect to us",Thawxtem,1
"If possible, I’d like to try to run it twice for quest",Thawxtem,1
For tokens  for acrius?,Arixama,1
For both I hope.,RonInDune,1
The acrius tokens I believe you can just do the first fight to unlock the door over and over I'm pretty sure.,Arixama,1
"^
Yes you can.",Trissin,1
Emperor Seals,Thawxtem,1
Exotic quest step,Thawxtem,1
"^
Yep, you can keep doing castellum over and over again for seals.",Trissin,1
At least you could last year,Trissin,1
"Idk if it's different now, but I don't think they'd change it.",Trissin,1
"Just claimed Horror Story, and it spawned as my first 600 weapon!",Thawxtem,1
oh dang congrats,RonInDune,1
I'm pretty sure it's 600 for everybody. Does it have a level requirement?,Arixama,1
"Idk, I’ve started getting 600 armor, I was just excited for a weapon to accompany them",Thawxtem,1
I need acrius too...10 seals for this guy. I also was thinking about trying to get some IKELOS swag from EP since all 3 drop this week,Aberration,1
"@Aberration If you go for Destiny sometime tonight, I'd be willing to run EP with you",Thawxtem,1
No can do friendo. Early AM work,Aberration,1
"Alright, alright, alright",Thawxtem,1
_let's see what we've got._,Trissin,1
"_Fallen, on the horizon!_",Trissin,1
Btw im 584 @Trissin,Mr.Kaeron,1
I'm home in 30. Looking for NF and EP if anyone is interested,Aberration,1
got lots of schoolwork :((,Trissin,1
I'll be up in about 4 ~ 5 hours,RonInDune,1
RIP me. No problem haha,Aberration,1
Sorry ... 😞,RonInDune,1
I wish I had speeds like this at home. I wager I'd get a lot less Bee and Buffalo errors!,RonInDune,1
😮,Trissin,1
That's pretty sweet. Does a higher network speed make forsaken exotics to drop?,Aberration,1
LOL,Trissin,1
I'll take that as a probably not,Aberration,1
you gotten any forsaken exotics yet @Aberration ?,Trissin,1
I actually for Trinity ghoul last week,Aberration,1
😮,Trissin,1
Got*,Aberration,1
jealousss,Trissin,1
thats so nice!,Trissin,1
"idk whether its actually any good, but it looks like fun to use",Trissin,1
Its a cool weapon. I haven't really gotten the feel for it yet,Aberration,1
Gotta compare it's damage to a regular bow. Slow draw but it has a triple shot and the proc does massive damage,Aberration,1
damnn,Trissin,1
You gotta be really good at precision,Aberration,1
"Of all the forsaken exotics, I've found Chromatic fire and Ace of Spades to be the absolute best combo!",RonInDune,1
I'd like the chromatic for sure,Aberration,1
ooh yeah chromatic fire looks like fun,Trissin,1
"The sword is really bad though, black talon I think it's called.",RonInDune,1
i have 1 forsaken exotic lol,Trissin,1
"wait, actually, i have ace",Trissin,1
so i guess that makes 2?,Trissin,1
i got the heart of inmost light,Trissin,1
Chaperone?,RonInDune,1
titan chest piece,Trissin,1
2*,Aberration,1
it seems.. alright? to be honest i havent noticed much of an effect from it,Trissin,1
"it looks cool tho 👍 , matches with the reverie dawn armor",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
Man I haven't played as a Titan even one in Destiny,RonInDune,1
I really should start the character out,RonInDune,1
"Titan is cool, all classes definitely have perks",Aberration,1
"I honestly thought reading the description that warlock would be a support mage/healer class. Which it is, kinda sorta",RonInDune,1
That's my go to class in any RPG,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, attunement of Grace is pretty awesome",Aberration,1
well of radiance is pretty crazy,Trissin,1
Wish I had picked Nova warp over chaos reach tho,Aberration,1
Kamehameha is neat but just not as effective,Aberration,1
you can get your 3rd seed btw,Trissin,1
The annoying thing is that the sword you plop down for well of radiance has a big hit box,RonInDune,1
I've died so many time to rickets hitting that,RonInDune,1
*rockets,RonInDune,1
3rd seed is raid locked isn't it,Aberration,1
I dont think so,Trissin,1
No you get it from [REDACTED],RonInDune,1
the 2nd one comes from either Kalli or from Blind Well,Trissin,1
LOL,Trissin,1
I have the blind well one. Gotta run brb 20,Aberration,1
You get it in the 3rd curse week,RonInDune,1
"Chaos reach is OK on its own, but it's super good with geomags",Arixama,1
"Geomags, did those get added to the game yet? I feel like there was a teaser about some yellow engrams dropping eventually",Aberration,1
Oh man doing the Hive lost sector on Mars with geomags on I had my super going for the entire boss fight. It's was blinding,RonInDune,1
You just have get 1000 edge transits first and then the 1001st decrypts into a random exotic. Most likely from year 1.,Arixama,1
"I mean, I'm all for getting my 4th vesper of radius",Aberration,1
any1 for whisper of the worm?,Mr.Kaeron,1
"sorry, i've got a bit of work to finish up atm",Trissin,1
:((,Trissin,1
i havebnt even done blind well yet,Masrim,1
@Destiny [PC] Who wants to mess around in the old blind well? Get some seeds of light and some weekly bounty action up in here?,Aberration,1
i dont have dreaming city on my hunter yet 😦,Trissin,1

I should be able to be available at some point. Just not super sure exactly when,Arixama,1
"okay, great",Trissin,1
"I also see gimmie2 and masrim online right now, are you guys interested? @Gimmie2 @Masrim ?",Trissin,1
@Thawxtem or @Helatia might be up later I think,RonInDune,1
"okay, great",Trissin,1
"I don't usually get online during the weekend, but if you hit me up monday-friday I can",Helatia,1
"Not atm, got some stuff to do",Gimmie2,1
if you guys are still down in about 6 hours ill be available,Gimmie2,1

That's cool with me! I though we were doing last wish,RonInDune,1
I never done it,Mr.Kaeron,1
Leviathan is fine,RonInDune,1

True true. When will you be back @Aberration ?,RonInDune,1
Probably not for a couple hours at least :\,Aberration,1
"Hmm I can wait, I'm free this evening",RonInDune,1
ok we're ready,Mr.Kaeron,1
we need another... aberration cant stay for the full run,Trissin,1
😢,Trissin,1
how long does it usually take?,Mr.Kaeron,1
"well since we have people who are new, probably a bit over 2 hours",Trissin,1
it really depends on the group I find,Trissin,1
invite nat,Mr.Kaeron,1
I just got home from work. Sad I missed raid :nkoCry:,Thawxtem,1
Yeah I was a letdown. I'm going to be available in like 10 tho...,Aberration,1
We just finished!,RonInDune,1
Hey @PC anyone want to join us on the the Corrupted city strike? We're going on a lore hunt,RonInDune,1
Anyone wants to do 100k score nightfall today? It's the only weekly I'm missing,Mr.Kaeron,1
"I'd be up for NF today, after work",Aberration,1
"@Mr.Kaeron That would likely be sometime maybe 12-13 hours from now, however! Long day",Aberration,1
Oke,Mr.Kaeron,1
I'm up for that as well,naT,1
I want that juicy NF loot,naT,1
@Mr.Kaeron @naT  OK - if there's any interest in some NF I'm finally back,Aberration,1
yes sure,naT,1
wow I leveled up,naT,1
👌,naT,1
@Aberration how do we go about it? I never went for a high score nf,naT,1
neither have I,Aberration,1
haha,Aberration,1
running quick gambit for daily,Aberration,1
how hard is to do 100k nf,Mr.Kaeron,1
never done it,Mr.Kaeron,1
no clue!,Aberration,1
"not difficult, just be careful",Trissin,1
"put on some modifiers, increase the handicap",Trissin,1
you want to be between around 3.8 - 4.2x score I believe,Trissin,1
id recommend you guys go into voice as well,Trissin,1
makes coordination easier,Trissin,1
"just play safe, u guys should be fine 👍",Trissin,1
I've heard going in as an all edge transit team gives you a +10x modifier,RonInDune,1
LOL,Trissin,1
Might do raincheck this week,Mr.Kaeron,1
really tired,Mr.Kaeron,1
and workin in like 7 hours,Mr.Kaeron,1
we can probs just do a regular ez run,Aberration,1
I'm ready when you are @naT,Aberration,1
"Remember to do the ""Nothing Left to Say"" heroic daily for the triumph!",RonInDune,1
what triumph?,Trissin,1
"""You're not my sister"" vanguard triumph",RonInDune,1
For completing a final story mission on heroic,RonInDune,1
ohhhhhhhh,Trissin,1
I have to do Panoptes as well for the triumph but that one is harder to solo with blackout,RonInDune,1
5th Vesper of Radius drop today! Keep em coming!,Aberration,1
:((,Trissin,1
"If anyone wants to do the Corrupted DC nightfall, I'd love to join! I want to farm it as much as possible",Thawxtem,1
I'm game this week. For sure.,Aberration,1
Me too,RonInDune,1
Usually will be available around this time for an hour or two,Aberration,1
@RonInDune you available for a nightfall now? Any ideas on a 3rd if so? Aberration is offline,Thawxtem,1
"Sorry dude I'm a bit busy now. I can come online a bit later, couple of hours from now",RonInDune,1
"Okay, I understand, maybe see you then",Thawxtem,1
@Thawxtem  I think I can squeeze in a NF run if you'd like,Aberration,1
when do you guys wanna do another raid this week?,Mr.Kaeron,1
I’m available tomorrow and Saturday,Thawxtem,1
I would still love to run a Nightfall Corrupted,Thawxtem,1
any1 knows where xur is this week?,Mr.Kaeron,1
Nessus I think,RonInDune,1
watcherrs grave okay,Mr.Kaeron,1
"So I'm looking to try and get NF done this weekend for sure @Thawxtem , with 3 people it should be no problem.",Aberration,1
Technically I have 3 characters that can run it and could use it,Aberration,1
"Well, I would be happy to help! I work until 5:30 Saturday & Sunday",Thawxtem,1
A third would be great; completed it with 2 but it was a pain with all the ads at the boss,Thawxtem,1
"I am down for nightfall, have not done one since the update",Masrim,1
"Eating now, I’ll be getting on afterwards so I’ll be ready soon whenever you two are.",Thawxtem,1
Borrow Raid chat?,Thawxtem,1
OK NBY ME,Masrim,1
The 'A Deadly Trial' story mission is the shorted mission ever! Are there any faster missions in the game?,RonInDune,1
If you're really efficient you can one kill the mission.,RonInDune,1
Gotta love the quick ones. Best way to churn out all 3 easy,Aberration,1
"Not true about 1 kill I'm pretty sure. You have to kill. The walker, and then like 3 enemies at the end.",Arixama,1
Ice and shadow and utopia are also very good missions.,Arixama,1
OH yeah you're right I forgot about the invisible weirdos in the basement,RonInDune,1
"They're easy though. Just run through the door, then turn and toss a grenade",Arixama,1
I'm slowly working my way to the wayfarer title.,Arixama,1
"Ice and Shadow is slightly faster I think? 2 required kills, takes about 4 minutes to complete on an optimal run.",Oathbreaker,1
Is it just just or is the crucible suddenly full of really high skill but really low level players?,RonInDune,1
I'm seeing Level 10 and Level 15 players getting 10x streaks regularly,RonInDune,1
d2 vanilla is free right now,Arixama,1
Yeah but then I'd expect the opposite isn't it?,RonInDune,1
Lots of people even worse than me,RonInDune,1
all your sweaty bois are picking the game up and going straight into pvp.,Arixama,1
damn,RonInDune,1
@Trissin we doing leviathan this week?,Mr.Kaeron,1
I'm down for Levi at the weekend,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, some people might be creating alt accounts for just PVP",Oathbreaker,1
"You guys are more than welcome to organize raids and activities @Mr.Kaeron , but I dont think I will be able to help out with anything until Friday at the latest",Trissin,1
Pretty busy with school this week :S,Trissin,1
"Alright hey all, after I finish my midterms this Friday, I'd like to get a serious run of Last Wish going over this weekend (I don't expect to finish it in one or two sittings) @PC",Trissin,1
"I would be looking to start on Friday night, and plan more time over the weekend as needed",Trissin,1
Heck yeah dude I'm ready!,RonInDune,1
We'll do a no death run easy.,RonInDune,1
id definitely be down.,Arixama,1
"As always, all are welcome to join, but I would definitely recommend some previous raiding experience as this is quite a difficult run",Trissin,1
we can just start off on a petras run. 😂,Arixama,1
I'll also say it's good to be at least.. 550 light?,Trissin,1
"Anyway, let's see how much interest we have and go from there",Trissin,1
"i would say 560 to be safe, but 550 is definitely doable",Arixama,1
"Another note is that I've never completed last wish myself, and I only have a rough idea of what's going on, but I'll brush up on the mechanics before going in",Trissin,1
Great!,RonInDune,1
Basically I won't be a reliable guide for this one,Trissin,1
i've completed the first 3 encounters,Arixama,1
Anyway,Trissin,1
Oh sweet,Trissin,1
You guide us this time @Arixama ! 👍,Trissin,1
Pinned a message.,Trissin,1
"I almost solo-ed the first encounter at 600 power, so it shouldn't be too hard.",RonInDune,1
"Anyway, I think I would be good to start at around 7pm ET (6pm CT), let me know if you're interested and free that night!",Trissin,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
"6cst is going to be cutting it a little close for me, but it should be available close to then at least",Arixama,1
"No worries, the start time isn't concrete",Trissin,1
We can push it back as needed,Trissin,1
"I would be interested if y’all have room, but I also have minimal raiding experience",Stephen,1
Ok.... I don't really have a final answer atm - we'll have to see who else is interested and able to join - but I'm not sure if last wish is a good place to start off,Trissin,1
How much experience do u have @Stephen ?,Trissin,1
"The issue is that since none of our team has actually completed last wish yet, none of us are really able to actually sherpa the group",Trissin,1
"I would be more than happy to run any of the other raids with you, or do another run of last wish after I'm more experienced",Trissin,1
"and since nobody has any actual last wish experience, that's why I am putting some value on previous raiding experience, because it is such a long raid and it is very demanding as well (and I'd like to be able to finish it before the reset next Tuesday!)",Trissin,1
"Yeah that makes sense, I haven’t even completed a raid in d2 so...",Stephen,1
Good luck tho,Stephen,1
I won't be able to this weekend because the wife will be in town. After we've moved in and get settled I would love to do some raiding,Helatia,1
@Stephen let us know if you're ever interested in doing one of the raids! Happy to guide people through any of the Leviathans 😃,Trissin,1
"@Helatia we'll definitely go through last wish and the other raids a lot more after this weekend, i think lots of us have just been fairly busy lately",Trissin,1
"@Trissin not sure if I did Warmind thing right, but I’m all in on Friday. I’m Warlock 599-600 depending on guns",Thawxtem,1
Great!,Trissin,1
Im already at 600 @Trissin,Mr.Kaeron,1
"I'm not 100% sure if there is space left since I do have one friend joining us as well, and i'm not sure if @Aberration is joining us or whether he is sitting as an alternate",Trissin,1
and the other aspect might be experience since you've done leviathan once,Trissin,1
do u mind joining as an alternate?,Trissin,1
we'll see if @Aberration is playing or not,Trissin,1
@McDryAnal,Trissin,1
Wat,McDryAnal,1
"Also, could we stop by and make the 14th wish before the raid? I plan on going egg hunting",Thawxtem,1
"yeah absolutely, np lol",Trissin,1
do u have the wish ender @Thawxtem ?? 😮,Trissin,1
Damn that reminds me I still haven't done the Shattered throne yet.,RonInDune,1
"^
me neither",Trissin,1
Yep,Thawxtem,1
😮,Trissin,1
i havent had the time to do it yet :((,Trissin,1
18 eggs done,Thawxtem,1
You on?,Thawxtem,1
not atm,Trissin,1
If we got a 3rd I could help get you the bow,Thawxtem,1
"If you've got someone that can give you a fresh instance of the raid, you can do 4 of the 5 eggs in last wish alone.",Arixama,1
"actually, how long does the shattered throne take @Thawxtem ?",Trissin,1
"I'd love to hop in to get the bow, but I won't be free till tomorrow evening",RonInDune,1
"^
im fairly busy as well atm",Trissin,1
but thank u for the offer!,Trissin,1
😃,Trissin,1
"I never timed it, but the first part seems to be the most time consuming if I remember correctly. Actually, pulling secrets for the second run for the bow could take a minute",Thawxtem,1
@Trissin are you free tomorrow evening?,Thawxtem,1
"Well actually, I've got a midterm on friday so I'll probably be studying for that",Trissin,1
It's okay,Trissin,1
I can grab the wish ender another time,Trissin,1
thank u so much tho,Trissin,1
perhaps over the weekend or something,Trissin,1
"Don’t know when your test ends, but perhaps we could meet a while before the raid?",Thawxtem,1
"just trying to get you raid eggs, too",Thawxtem,1
"my test ends fairly late, but dont worry about it haha!",Trissin,1
I can get the eggs another time 😃,Trissin,1
thanks againn,Trissin,1
Alrighty :yes:,Thawxtem,1
@PC I'm running shattered throne right now if anyone wants to join,Helatia,1
just ran ST,naT,1
> never again,naT,1
?? why is that,Trissin,1
the name of the triumph 😛,naT,1
also running it for the first time was a bit tiring tbh,naT,1
lots of tries on the last boss,naT,1
"ah, lol",Trissin,1
and they're pretty stingy with ammo for some reason,naT,1
I got some bad news for ya buddy,Arixama,1
whats up?,Trissin,1
You have to run shattered throne twice for wish ender. That's all. 😂,Arixama,1
ohhh lol,Trissin,1
Not to mention Toland's quest,Thawxtem,1
"Oh y, but do you need to kill the last boss for the bow?",Mr.Kaeron,1
no,Helatia,1
Hey guys what's a good lore channel that puts up ton date videos?,RonInDune,1
I want to know about this week's oracle offering,RonInDune,1
Hey @Aberration are you joining us for last wish tonight?,Trissin,1
"also, @Arixama , I think you said 6 cst is a bit early for you - what time is good for u?",Trissin,1
So optimistically I'll be home at 615 ish,Arixama,1
I'm aiming for around 6:30 CST,RonInDune,1
"Okay sure, we'll try to start at 6:30 CST",Trissin,1
Coolio.,Arixama,1
"And it looks like we might still be looking for one more, depending on whats going on with @Aberration",Trissin,1
Maybe @Mr.Kaeron ?,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, we'll see who is available.",Trissin,1
Looking for what guys?,Mr.Kaeron,1
Last wish raid!,RonInDune,1
ahh,Mr.Kaeron,1
today? im gonna do some stuff with nat and tsushibi tonight,Mr.Kaeron,1
I'm still up in the air unfortunately. There's some family things that I have to attend to and I'm not entirely sure on how long it's gonna take. I'd say certainly fill my spot if you can but I'll so my best. Sorry I'm flaky on this one,Aberration,1
"no worries, I understand",Trissin,1
"I work from 5-9EST tonight, otherwise I'd be in. Sorry guys and best of luck.",Oathbreaker,1
I'll be waiting in the Raid chat,Thawxtem,1
btw we are gonna start a little later @Thawxtem !,Trissin,1
ari and ron will be ready in about 40 minutes,Trissin,1
"I read that earlier, but thanks. Just trying to set up a chat room early for communication purposes. Also lets me have a little slack from constantly checking the time",Thawxtem,1
"whisper catalyst done, got wish ender as well",Mr.Kaeron,1
:yes:,Thawxtem,1
😄,Mr.Kaeron,1
Did you get the whisper ship along side the catalyst?,Thawxtem,1
one more for last wish? @PC,Trissin,1
yes I got the ship @Thawxtem  😄,Mr.Kaeron,1
Going to be slightly later than 630. Traffic is a bitch.,Arixama,1
"ok, no worries",Trissin,1
Alright I'm coming online now,RonInDune,1

"So I think I have to bail on raid tonight, it's my brother's birthday and we're doing family dinner at 530",Arixama,1
"okay, np!",Trissin,1
"i might be able to do the raid, what time you guys going at?",Masrim,1
Around 6:30 to 7 central I think,RonInDune,1
i shoukd be around,Masrim,1
"just installing a new OS on a new HD right now, should be done in plenty of time",Masrim,1
"I've also got my friend who couldn't join last night, he might join us tonight as well",Trissin,1
"I think we may as well just start fresh from kalli, it's better to learn a raid fresh than to learn halfway through",Trissin,1
Plus you can reinput the egg code for thawx,Arixama,1
right true true,Trissin,1
:juicebox:,Thawxtem,1
Who else is doing last wish tonight? @PC ?,Trissin,1
how much time does it usually take?,Masrim,1
also my max power level i think is 567,Masrim,1
THat's good enough!,RonInDune,1
You'll level up through the raid quite a bit I think,RonInDune,1
It takes a while,Thawxtem,1
"This is weird. This emblem dropped after killing the Malfeasance boss, but then disappeared.",RonInDune,1
I can't even reacquire it from collections.,RonInDune,1
... looks like we don't have enough people to continue?,Trissin,1
curious. Who is here/ready?,Thawxtem,1
I am,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune ask bungie?,Thawxtem,1
"If it's just us 3, I think I might drop out for now",Trissin,1
I have a few things I gotta do,Trissin,1
"alright. I was thinking if it was 3, then maybe we could get dungeon rewards. or, if it was 4 we could go for Gambit Malfeasance",Thawxtem,1
I'm down for Shatter throne run,RonInDune,1
oh true,Trissin,1
I really need a haircut though..... Lol,Trissin,1
I think I'll head out for now and I'll be back later,Trissin,1
real life comes first,Thawxtem,1
"and we can go from there, if people are still interested in raiding or throne we can do that after",Trissin,1
@RonInDune check out the gambit emblem for an alternate on that emblem.,Arixama,1
Similar to the location emblems?,Arixama,1
"mango and I are looking to do shattered throne tonight, anybody else interested?",Trissin,1
i believe @RonInDune still needed to do it,Trissin,1
Oh heck yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
WHen are you planning?,RonInDune,1
Do you have the lore pieces already? I need to get those too,RonInDune,1
"We'll do it pretty soon, mango will be good to go within a half-hour I would say",Trissin,1
"and I dont have the lore pieces either, we can grab them",Trissin,1
"I completely forgot lol, thanks for reminding me",Trissin,1
"Alright I'm farming alkane dust right now, I'll be ready in 5 mins or so",RonInDune,1
👍,Trissin,1
Alright I'm ready when you need me,RonInDune,1
i don't think mango is ready just yet,Trissin,1
you should go ahead and do other activities for now I think,Trissin,1
OK yeah I'll go have some dinner in the meanwhile,RonInDune,1

"hey @Arixama , would you mind giving us a hand?",Trissin,1
yo @Trissin we missed like so many easy lore pieces.,RonInDune,1
We'd have to be ascendant for all/most of them though,RonInDune,1
oops,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
dont worry! we'll grab em next time,Trissin,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
Did you do the mission for the wish ender? It's hard as heck,RonInDune,1
no I haven't done it yet,Trissin,1
I've done it. It's more annoying than hard. It's doable,Mr.Kaeron,1
i believe the thunderlord is now out and available to be obtained 😮,Trissin,1
i heard it takes you back to the cosmodrome!!!!!!,Trissin,1
_memories_,Trissin,1
Oh no I can't play the whole day and I'll have to wait.This is a great tragedy.,RonInDune,1
"dont worry ron, i wont be on till tomorrow either",Trissin,1
It's real fun.,Arixama,1
I have a bunch of things to do this week.... DOESN'T MATTER THUNDERLORD.,Oathbreaker,1
Just got a Supremacy..... Was super hyped until Rapid Hit/Ambitious Assassin. FeelsBadMan,Oathbreaker,1
Is that the raid sniper?,RonInDune,1
"Yep, and it has nostalgia value for me because I used it all the time in D1Y1",Oathbreaker,1
Looking for a Snapshot perk on it and anything else is a bonus,Oathbreaker,1
Oh too bad. I know of it only cause it gets referenced all the time in the lore,RonInDune,1
"GOD IT WAS SO GOOD OTHERWISE TOO. HANDLING MW, WITH HANDLING PERKS",Oathbreaker,1
RNG WHY DO YOU DO THIS TO ME,Oathbreaker,1
RNGesus has not blessed you today,Aberration,1
But I gotta say that the thunderlord totally shreds. Fantastic!,Aberration,1
Looking for Iron Banana partners. All I'm doing tonight.,Thawxtem,1
Hey so what are the odds of us trying Last Wish again this weekend?,RonInDune,1
I was actually going to bring that up as well,Trissin,1

"That makes 5 for at least Sunday, right?",Thawxtem,1
What was the really good hunter boot that @Trissin was looking for during the raid?,RonInDune,1
Orpheus rig probably,Arixama,1
wut,Trissin,1
I dont recall looking for any boots during the raid,Trissin,1
I think you were talking about them.,Arixama,1
Oh I meant you said that they would be useful during the second bss,RonInDune,1
Orpheus rig makes sense,RonInDune,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
For people interested in running Last Wish tomorrow 👍,Trissin,1
Yay I got my first Forsaken Hunter exotic!,RonInDune,1

Sorry!,RonInDune,1
"If you have more than one, be sure to share those refer-a-friends :ScaryYoto:",Thawxtem,1
Anybody else interested in last wish tomorrow? @PC,Trissin,1
"I'm also wondering if we can push this start time a bit earlier, perhaps around like 5 pm CT? (only if that works, just seeing what times are good for people)",Trissin,1
"I don’t leave work until around 5:30 CT, sorry",Thawxtem,1
what time for last wish?,Mr.Kaeron,1
Around 8 hours from now?,RonInDune,1
oh boy,Mr.Kaeron,1
not sure if I can make it at that time,Mr.Kaeron,1
Could start as early as 7 hours from now but yeah,RonInDune,1
would be 1 am here 😂 not doable on a sunday,naT,1
y I'd love to go,Mr.Kaeron,1
but got work tomorrow,Mr.Kaeron,1
Maybe we should do it earlier then?,Trissin,1
So far only 3 people for the one tonight,Trissin,1
"I'm not sure I would be able to go today anyway, so don't worry about me",naT,1
Well what time would you be free to do it today @naT ? Also @Mr.Kaeron and @Tsushibi if interested?,Trissin,1
2 hours from now max,Mr.Kaeron,1
"alright, are there other people free ~ 2 hours from now, who are interested in doing last wish? no exp required @PC",Trissin,1
Oh yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
It's just that I don't think we will have enough people for tonight. :c,Trissin,1
@here so are people interested in doing Last Wish or no..?,Trissin,1
"I am, in a strike right now",RonInDune,1
there are actually enough people online right now to do it,Trissin,1
"if we get @Mr.Kaeron, @Tsushibi , @naT , @Masrim",Trissin,1
I''m ready when you need me. Still grinding milestones to power up my hunter,RonInDune,1
People are just not online or not responding 😦,Trissin,1
"Hey guys, not gonna do raid tonight",Tsushibi,1
Sorry bud im going to bed soon as well,Mr.Kaeron,1
"have fun, good luck",Tsushibi,1
"can't as well, sorry",naT,1
Ah well we'll try again next week I guess,RonInDune,1
"Also, I got my hunter to 600!",RonInDune,1
2 Chars at 600 power,RonInDune,1
"Just the titan left now, which will be a challenge.",RonInDune,1
"So I know @Thawxtem and @RonInDune are down for last wish, anybody else?",Trissin,1
@here,Trissin,1
"Heads up, just got home. Fixing to eat, but I’ll have discord up on my phone",Thawxtem,1
"Sure thing, but we don't have a team together. We're still missing 3",Trissin,1
Just saw earlier you said no one was responding,Thawxtem,1
We might not be able to run it tonight,Trissin,1
No shattered throne either this week,RonInDune,1
yeah,Trissin,1
"Unfortunately I'm probably a no, working on some math atm and have an 8am class tomorrow morning, AKA ""Why did I decide that this timeslot was a good idea for a Monday?""",Oathbreaker,1
loool thats ok,Trissin,1
i guess we cant do it tonight,Trissin,1
"If you have a character that needs exp later, I still need to run Forsaken campaign on my Titan",Thawxtem,1
@Oathbreaker 8 AM classes are the worst,RonInDune,1
"Oh this one isn't so bad, it's just I gotta get up early so I can drive to school. The actual class is enjoyable.",Oathbreaker,1
I taught (actually just TA-d) an 8 AM class and  it was not the best choice I've ever made,RonInDune,1
"Yeah..... really depends on if the class is okay. If it's one of those classes that are just dry and not really enjoyable, then it's hell. But IMO, if the class isn't really boring then I don't mind the 8AM start.",Oathbreaker,1
What was the place that you guys go to in order to find the occasional 6th? I was thinking about looking there to join a Leviathan,Thawxtem,1
"Okay, despite the shit that Spectral Blades gets, it's actually an amazing super",Oathbreaker,1
Gwisin Vest literally turns it into a Super that can last *over a minute long*,Oathbreaker,1
It's actually disgusting,Oathbreaker,1
I didn't get Spectral Blades with my 2nd seed of light and am now heavily regretting it. The new Arcstrider is really bad. I still can't use the melee at all.,RonInDune,1
I'll upload the video sometime over the next few days to show just how long it lasts. It's nuts.,Oathbreaker,1
"lol @RonInDune , i have actively been putting off the new arcstrider",Trissin,1
I have the seed of light but just dont even want to level it,Trissin,1
also yeah @Oathbreaker gwising vest is pretty insane!!,Trissin,1
"you get more energy after every time you heavy uppercut and stealth, dont you?",Trissin,1
Yeah that's the perk,Oathbreaker,1
Completely busted. I had a match where I was in super for a minute and 46 seconds. The only reason it didn't go longer was because the match *ended*.,Oathbreaker,1
"ok dumb question, but how do you stealth after wards?",Masrim,1
I think you activate stealth during spectral blades by using the uppercut heavy attack,Trissin,1
Like right after the actual attack you just automatically stealth,Trissin,1
"so right click, sadly I don't think I ever did that lol",Masrim,1
loool,Trissin,1
"so been playing with that vest, you get more energy for each kill before you stealth.  so kill 4 then uppercut and you get a lot more energy",Masrim,1
"Sorry, would have answered sooner. Bit of a rough night for me though. But yeah, heavy attack returns you to stealth. Also, there's a cadence to the regen. Listen to the sound cues, there's the first chime like noise then a second one about 2 seconds later. When that second chime goes off, you can heavy attack again to regen super energy.",Oathbreaker,1
Any time before that and you'll just waste the super energy.,Oathbreaker,1
"Will folks be available for another go at the raid this weekend? Doesn't have to be last wish, we can try any of the others or maybe even prestige.",RonInDune,1
"^
I would love to raid this weekend",Trissin,1
I still think we should go for last wish,Trissin,1
"I have a pretty good understanding of what's going on now, and we just need the people for it",Trissin,1
Yeah I'm free almost all the time till Sunday. So whenever it's easy for people to match up...,RonInDune,1
"don't have calender beside me, but I can try",Thawxtem,1
If it's earlier in the day I may be able to get in on that finally,Aberration,1
like what time? @Aberration,Trissin,1
"Hey guys any suggestions on black Friday deals on Destiny type games? 

I'm looking for something with the same type of shooting really... 

I got the new Doom and it's somehow completely different.",RonInDune,1
"In my opinion at least, Destiny kind of has a unique feel to its guns and gunplay. If you like the loot and shoot genre, Borderlands would be a good place to start. I would love to recommend Titanfall 2, but it's been out for 2 years and its playerbase is dying slowly iirc. It's also a very high skill PvP game so... Another loot and shoot that comes to mind is Warframe, though it's not the best with explaining things and is a third person game.",Oathbreaker,1
"I don't know if there's a deal going on, but id look at the borderlands series. Gun plays will be slightly different, but there's the elemental gun types that affect different enemies, and there's the random roll aspect to the guns as well.",Arixama,1
Welp,Arixama,1
"I've tried Borderlands 2 but the humour in the starting area was so bad to me to me that I bounced right off.

Titanfall 2 seems to have great reviews and is $5 so I'll get that, thanks!",RonInDune,1
Haha I might give that another go,RonInDune,1
"Well if you're not a fan of the humor in the first area, its pretty consistent throughout",Arixama,1
"That trash can robot, whose name I forget, was annoying. Is he there all throughout?",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, Titanfall 2 is a really fun and insanely faced paced shooter... I'd highly recommend playing through the campaign first and try to get the movement systems down to a T. It's pretty much PvP only, but there is a PvE mode that's wave defense.",Oathbreaker,1
"Played it for a while, if you have any questions let me know. Would be more than happy to answer them.",Oathbreaker,1
Thanks guys! I'll get through the campaign and tell you what that was like.,RonInDune,1
"Claptrap, yeah he's pretty consistently there. Not as present as ghost, but fairly  present",Arixama,1
Aww well. I'll still give it a fair shake one more time.,RonInDune,1
"warframe is also i pretty unique one. third person shooter, and you dont really find guns, but you find mods that allowing to customize you weapon how you like. the crafting system is pretty good.",Arixama,1
@Oathbreaker when was the last time you played warframe?,Arixama,1
uhhhhhhhhh,Oathbreaker,1
A while ago?,Oathbreaker,1
Like right before Fortuna?,Oathbreaker,1
did you ever do the starter questline?,Arixama,1
The Vor one? Yeah. I'm like 80% done Star Chart iirc,Oathbreaker,1
In the middle of Chains of Harrow I think,Oathbreaker,1
Oh man I joined warframe like 5 years ago and I have no idea what the game does anymore.,RonInDune,1
I apparently have 17 platinum whatever that means.,RonInDune,1
"i played way back when they didnt really explain a lot, and now that the switch version is out and ive been playing through the beginning it seems more explain-y as far as i remember.",Arixama,1
"Damn according to steam I've last played Warframe on 8th May, 2014.",RonInDune,1
"Next Saturday, I’d like to make a group that will be farming the dungeon. This includes getting Wish Ender for those who don’t have it, getting the bones/eggs in the dungeon, as well as just clearing constantly for loot",Thawxtem,1
I’m free all day,Thawxtem,1
I'm down,RonInDune,1
"^
me too",Trissin,1
@Trissin @RonInDune when are you open?,Thawxtem,1
"If a second group forms I'd be in for Saturday, should be around. As for today - I think I should have time most of the day until about 9pm est if anyone would like to do anything",Aberration,1
I'm interested in going for last wish again today,Trissin,1
Are people free for last wish today? @PC,Trissin,1
"I am, yeah",RonInDune,1
"There's half of a Fireteam, hopefully we can get 3 more today",Trissin,1
Count me in,Thawxtem,1
"Is there anybody here at all interested in Last Wish activities? no experience is required, we just need 2 more for a full fireteam! @PC",Trissin,1
I’m working on getting my characters up and then I’ll be able to join in with you guys. Recently migrated from PS4,Crak,1
ohh i see npnp,Trissin,1
Just hit 500. Now the grind begins,Crak,1
"Having dinner with family right now, but would anyone like to do the weekly DC quest before the raid group starts?",Thawxtem,1
we still need 2 more for the raid,Trissin,1
We can finally invite people to fireteam without having to be friends with them,Arixama,1
"Sorry for the absence guys, I'll be on after my exams next week. Just in time for Black Armory!",Peronix,1
@Trissin @RonInDune Are you guys still open for Dungeon farming on Saturday? When is a good time for you?,Thawxtem,1
Oh heck yeah,RonInDune,1
I haven't started Destiny yet since the update though so I might eb a bit lost,RonInDune,1
Evenings maybe?,RonInDune,1
^,Trissin,1
im ready for that wish ender,Trissin,1
"Major season 5 doesn't start until next week, the only thing that changed this week are special s5 engrams for eververse and a 1 step eververse quest",Thawxtem,1
I still have to do the malfeasance trike,RonInDune,1
"Update did take a while for me, though",Thawxtem,1
I'm actually farming big taken for malfeasance,Thawxtem,1
Yeah I downloaded it and then realized I really don't have time till the weekend,RonInDune,1
I'm also game for Shattered Throne should anyone else care to do it. I also want to run some EP today if anyone's around - taking a sick day,Aberration,1
@RonInDune @Trissin I'll be on and ready at around 6-ish. going to a movie,Thawxtem,1
"ALrgiht perfect, that'll give me enough time to log in and do some of the boutnies and stuff",RonInDune,1
Just msg us when good! @Thawxtem,Trissin,1
"@Trissin @RonInDune Launching Destiny, see you in a minute. I'll be in Fireteam - D2 - Alpha chat to make communication easier",Thawxtem,1
ALright I just started a strike I'll join you as soon as I'm done,RonInDune,1
anyone else looking to do Shattered Throne today?,Aberration,1
@Aberration I can join you later on in the evening,RonInDune,1
Nice. Thanks - we'll see if timing lines up! I'm also looking to try and get EP Shotgun this week or next if anyones game,Aberration,1
31 more Gambit matches to go for Breakneck 😛,Aberration,1
😮,Trissin,1
get it!!!!! it's like the best PvE primary in the game,Trissin,1
"Its a time commit for sure, so many gambit matches ;_;",Aberration,1
also hoping for meatball spawn,Aberration,1
Hey @Thawxtem do you remember how you got the egg in the corrupted strike elevator area? I tried the strike a bunch of times last night and couldn't get it to spawn.?,RonInDune,1
"It falls down. You have to shoot it either when it's falling, or get lucky and have it land on the elevator. If it lands, it can still get knocked off, though.",Thawxtem,1
Not so sure I'll be able to run the throne after all tonight. Is it super hard to solo it?,Aberration,1
"It's not impossible, but pretty hard, yeah.",RonInDune,1
Anybody need the Corrupted Quest stage of Malfensence?,Samakain,1
Darkness in Light step i mean,Samakain,1
The strike?,Trissin,1
"I believe @Thawxtem and @RonInDune are on that step, you might want to see if you can do it with them @Samakain",Trissin,1
Yup I am on that one.,RonInDune,1
Chaos reach with geo mags will eat about half the end bosses health,Arixama,1
I actually got it done last night. Thanks though. If you guys still need some help drop me a line and i'll be happy too. 😃,Samakain,1
How active is the PC side?,Nexeran,1
"Not as active recently, since it's seems a fair few have just finished up midterm a and are gearing up for finals, but there's still a decent amount of activity",Arixama,1
Activity will be a bit low this weekend but otherwise theres something going on every week!,RonInDune,1
I just got a gaming PC so I may do destiny on PC and playstation,Nexeran,1
Sweet spots seem to be 7 - midnight cst most days,Arixama,1
Urgh I'm usually on in the am or after 11:30,Nexeran,1
I work swing shift,Nexeran,1
"Gotcha. I know that I do the ps4 and pc thing, but I'm way more active on pc.",Arixama,1
Pc basically revitalized d2 for me. Picked it up in June or July  and was max power and had almost every exotic before forsaken dropped,Arixama,1
Yeah im sure I won't have that much free time lol,Nexeran,1
Hey I'm an AM player usually - huzzah for more AM players,Aberration,1

Lol,Nexeran,1

lmaoo,Trissin,1
Haha sweet,Nexeran,1

My BN is Nexeran#1924 if anyone wants to add me,Nexeran,1
You peeps quick lmao,Nexeran,1
lool,Trissin,1
The thing I'm not looking forward to is starting over in d2,Nexeran,1
"honestly, it goes pretty fast",Arixama,1
at least it did in warmind,Arixama,1
Well If your good I'm sure. I haven't done PC gaming in years lol,Nexeran,1
i played mostly on a controller until whisper came out.,Arixama,1
Oh yeah I can connect a controller!,Nexeran,1
I'm stupid!,Nexeran,1
"it was what i was most used to for destiny, so it helped the transition",Arixama,1

The power requirement for the forge has been lowered by 5,Trissin,1
I didn't even get the annual pass. I barely get to raid due to my schedule so it didn't really seem worth the price of admission,Aberration,1
PS geomags are awesome,Aberration,1
Geomags are indeed awesome!,RonInDune,1
has any1 done the forge quest yet?,Mr.Kaeron,1

OH yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
let me know when,Aberration,1
"If it’s around 6 or later cst, could I join?",Thawxtem,1
Sure. Could try to organize it for later tonight,Aberration,1

my luck continues! finally got the ikelos sg,Aberration,1

Oh damn the ikelos weapons are what I'm missing to get the wayferer seal,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune youve got the osprey?,Arixama,1
Nope,RonInDune,1
Yeah I should have clarified,RonInDune,1
I don't have most of the Mars weapons,RonInDune,1
ooh I need the osprey too,Trissin,1
YOU get that from the nightfall right?,RonInDune,1
yep,Trissin,1
I haven't done a nightfall in ages,RonInDune,1
"I think nightfall weapons are much easier to farm now, as opposed to before",Trissin,1
Hmm maybe we can do some today,RonInDune,1
I definitely need to do that,Arixama,1
you guys want to farm the nightfall?,Trissin,1
Sure,RonInDune,1
"cool, when are you free @RonInDune",Trissin,1
A couple of hours from now,RonInDune,1
From 6:30 CST or so,RonInDune,1
"alright, we'll see if @Arixama can join us then, or what times work for him as well",Trissin,1
That definitely works for me.,Arixama,1

Hey guys sorry I was in a strike I'm joining up now,RonInDune,1

WE can start now if you want!,RonInDune,1
"Maybe if we had a 3rd, even just to go along with us. When I did it for Helatia, yes we were lower light, but all 3 people there were very helpful",Thawxtem,1
Trissin can join in with us!,RonInDune,1
@Aberration do you need to do the corrupted strike for malfeasance?,Trissin,1
yeah I dont have super long tho,Aberration,1
how long do you have?,Trissin,1
"I think with Ron and Thawxtem you should be okay, it won't take too long",Trissin,1
@Aberration,Trissin,1
"we can try it out, if its just the regular strike itll be like 10-15 mmin",Aberration,1

"man, bad times - had a game I was playing corrupt my system32 somehow",Aberration,1
"bricked my pc, had to format my ssd and go through all this crap just to get back",Aberration,1
Oh damn,RonInDune,1
Which game as it?,RonInDune,1
magic the gathering arena,Aberration,1
#betaproblems,Aberration,1
"got lucky today tho, phoenix protocol dropped off a dawning powerful bounty and then I got breakneck and finished the motes step of malfeasance",Aberration,1
NIce!,RonInDune,1
I'm stuck on around 70% for malfeasance,RonInDune,1
My issue is that it seems like nobody sticks together in gambit unless you're running it with people.,Arixama,1
"Half the time I lose motes is cause nobody is clearing blockers with me, and the other half is people just running off once they get some motes to bank and not clearing mobs",Arixama,1
Yeah its tough for sure. I usually sit back first round and just clear adds and watch how other people react,Aberration,1
"if other people are running around like idiots i usually just go small blockers, but if there are other add clearers ill go in for med/lg blockers",Aberration,1
most often ill just spam small blockers tho because every time I get greedy I get invaded by a queenbreaker dredgen,Aberration,1
"I try to do my gambit clears at the end of the week, when people who love the mode are still playing and not those who are just clearing the required matches for the powerful drop.",RonInDune,1
That's a valid point. I play a lot of mornings and it seems like skill is lower during the off times,Aberration,1
Easymode activate?,Aberration,1
its kind of a bummer that exotic weapons are really limited to the heavy slot for viability,Aberration,1
got this fancy malfeasance that I'll probably never use,Aberration,1
Pulled queenbreaker yesterday from a crucible rank up. It seems very good.,Arixama,1
ah man I'm jelly,Aberration,1
"Apparently it's ungodly in gambit, but I haven't tried it yet.",Arixama,1
It's disgusting in any PvP mode,Oathbreaker,1
"Aim in the general direction of someone and pull that trigger, it'll be a headshot",Oathbreaker,1
*Slight* exaggeration but it lands headshots that should be misses or bodyshots.,Oathbreaker,1

Tried to solo shattered throne,Aberration,1
"First part, not so bad once you figure it out. Second part...kinda annoying with the crappy platforming across tiny bridges with taken ogres blasting you around. Third part EZ.",Aberration,1
... my commiserations,RonInDune,1
Vorgeth...managed to get to one actual DPS phase,Aberration,1
got him down about 25% and then the wizards reset,Aberration,1
immediately exit the game,Aberration,1
question why I did that to myself,Aberration,1
@Trissin are we doing lw today?,Mr.Kaeron,1
"I would like to, I know @Arixama is busy, wondering if @RonInDune and @naT are available?",Trissin,1

@Samakain I have a little time right now if you'd like to try it.,Aberration,1
I could also bust out a nightfall real quick @Mr.Kaeron,Aberration,1
let me finish this forge,Mr.Kaeron,1
I'll be on in a min no worries,Aberration,1
I actually completely forgot that I was going to whip up a batch of cinnamon rolls this morning. Gotta make the dough so I need to raincheck for a little. Maybe 10-15?,Aberration,1
"Hey guys, I'm gonna be running one of my friends through regular leviathan soon (around 15 minutes from now), anybody interested in joining?",Trissin,1
Oh no I just left the house. Dang it!,RonInDune,1
noooo haha,Trissin,1
maybe we can wait for you!,Trissin,1

Nah we're going for a Christmas party. Good luck on the run! Don't forget the contenders she'll!,RonInDune,1
"will do, thanks! have fun at your party 👍",Trissin,1
anybody for leviathan then? @PC,Trissin,1
not today I work tomorrow,Mr.Kaeron,1
"would you guys be interested in doing a quick raid or something tonight, @RonInDune @Samakain ? (maybe something short like eater of worlds)",Trissin,1
if not its all good,Trissin,1
"Hmm I don't think so, sorry! I can't be there consistently...",RonInDune,1
haha no worries at all,Trissin,1
I'd love to normally but i gotta go into work in like half an hour,Samakain,1
Sorry I couldn't raid tonight! But I did get Malfeasance done finally!,RonInDune,1
still need motes here,Thawxtem,1
I played super conservative for that step,RonInDune,1
Kept dumping 3s and 4s,RonInDune,1
Wanted to do more raids but the timezone difference is quite problem for us in Portugal,Mr.Kaeron,1
Had black talon and cerberus drop yesterday,Arixama,1
Got dang man!,RonInDune,1
still waiting on QBB...do want,Aberration,1
Does anyone have any tips to get the mote thief emblem in gambit?,RonInDune,1
"I'm completely lost, never even get close to picking the 3 motes",RonInDune,1
Which one is that?,Mr.Kaeron,1
Is it required for dredgen?,Mr.Kaeron,1
It's the one where you have to collect 3 mores while invading,RonInDune,1
It's the last piece of lore that I haven't collected,RonInDune,1
Ohh,Mr.Kaeron,1
Not sure if I've done that,Mr.Kaeron,1
But I think I have,Mr.Kaeron,1
What class you rockin?,Mr.Kaeron,1
Warlock mostly,RonInDune,1
The only class I don't play as xD,Mr.Kaeron,1
Haha I play warlock cause Chaos reach metls the boss,RonInDune,1
"Take good invasion weps, get targets near mobs. Get shit from em",Mr.Kaeron,1
Y I do premade with 2 locks,Mr.Kaeron,1
It's amazing,Mr.Kaeron,1
"Yeah I though I'd never have to invade again after getting malfeasance, but then this one came out lol",RonInDune,1
Good call that!,RonInDune,1
"Bad omens iz good, thunderlord as well",Mr.Kaeron,1
Ahahahaha,Mr.Kaeron,1
U need abit of luck as well,Mr.Kaeron,1
True true,RonInDune,1
I'll check if I have it when I get home,Mr.Kaeron,1
If I do,Mr.Kaeron,1
Probably ran that with code of the missile,Mr.Kaeron,1
Hmm,RonInDune,1
My titan hasn't even completed forsaken yet sadly.,RonInDune,1
"Skullfort helm. Malfeasance, trust, bad omens. What what I was using",Mr.Kaeron,1
That's a nice combo,RonInDune,1
I'll have to try it,RonInDune,1
Well I was focusing on finishing dredgen at the time,Mr.Kaeron,1
If done well u get super twice per round,Mr.Kaeron,1
YOu have Dredgen! Dang dude,RonInDune,1
"Yis, spammed alot of gambit. Was just missing that third reset",Mr.Kaeron,1
Great freaking work,RonInDune,1
Light versus light is the most annoying 1. But it's doable. Just gotta be patient,Mr.Kaeron,1
"also unrelated, saturday would be a cool day to run Last wish if you guys are up for it",Mr.Kaeron,1
"@RonInDune just checked I have it, if you wanna try that with hunter or titan I can give you what I think would be good loadouts, if u play warlock I dont have much input since its the only class I dont play.",Mr.Kaeron,1
"I main warlock. Generally run chaos reach with geomags. I have been using breakneck/go figure/midnight coup primary, ikelos shotgun and thunderlord for weapons. Thunderlord shreds Invaders and while invading. Ikelos sg and chaos reach let's you pretty much solo the primeval",Aberration,1
I have yet to get any of the meatball drops for dredgen yet...boohoo rng,Aberration,1
OK the Izanami forge unlock nightfall is super duper hard. I keep dying to the shield bashes and getting kicked to orbit,RonInDune,1
"Finally made it to 650, this was such a slow grind.",RonInDune,1
Seems like you got a solid setup there. Just a matter of keeping at it. Bound to get it eventually,Mr.Kaeron,1
anyone for gambit?,MrGommyBoy,1
anyone for Nightfall?,MrGommyBoy,1
I finally had the grimoire delivered! It sold out almost instantly the first time around ...,RonInDune,1
"😮 nice!!! i was going to order one as well, but it sold out 😦",Trissin,1
"check amazon, saw it on there",Arixama,1
"oooh, will do, thanks!@",Trissin,1

"it comes on tuesday, so we'll see then",Arixama,1
Anyone up for helping with a 270 arms dealer nightfall?,Infernosi,1
So is anyone trying the niobe labs unlocking quest?,RonInDune,1
I'm hearing it's bit of a wild goose chase,RonInDune,1
haha i dont think it's been cleared yet,Trissin,1
Feel like it's harder than the raids at this point,RonInDune,1
"It's not really harder, it just that people are super overthinking things.",Arixama,1
"like the tree thing, lol",Trissin,1
The level 6?,RonInDune,1
Yeah,Arixama,1
I was watching that last night when everyone was going crazy with it,RonInDune,1
Like trying almost random dictionary words,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
"im really surprised how far the community got though, some of those are so difficult to find",Trissin,1
poems and gems and swords and all,Trissin,1
It's honestly pretty cool. Did bungie do anything similar in D1?,RonInDune,1
its not fully unlocked yet right?,Mr.Kaeron,1
"I'm watching a stream passively, and I don't think so",RonInDune,1
"I think the lesson bungie should take away is that maybe they need to make more complicated puzzles, since people are going super in depth",Arixama,1
If they actually try to do something like this in the future,Arixama,1
ronin can u gimme the link to the stream?,Mr.Kaeron,1
http://www.twitch.tv/xgladd this is one of them.,Arixama,1
https://www.twitch.tv/teawrex is the other,RonInDune,1

Welp,Oathbreaker,1
Doesn't matter who's racing for it now because it's just gonna get unlocked anyways,Oathbreaker,1
Aww that's a shame,RonInDune,1
These fan hunts are really cool,RonInDune,1
The problem is that there's a quest tied to the Forge the one of the steps is doing shattered throne,Arixama,1
"Yeah, and it's been 29 hours since release, no dice. Cool as it is, it's not something that Bungie wanted to be THIS long.",Oathbreaker,1
Is anybody interested in doing leviathan? I'd like to run a friend through it 😃,Trissin,1

U guys always run raid when I'm sleeping 😔,Mr.Kaeron,1
Hey anyone wants to try niobe's torment either late tonight or tomorrow?,RonInDune,1
Is anybody interested in Last Wish today?,Trissin,1

"Okay, will keep that in mind",Trissin,1
"Yeah I'll be driving back from Houston from around 6, so earliest probably for me is around 7:30 CST",RonInDune,1
why always on a sunday -_-,Mr.Kaeron,1
a lot of us are free on sunday!,Trissin,1
"classes throughout the week, work and other things on saturday",Trissin,1
If I can get my math done quickly I might be able to sneak in a raid tonight.,Oathbreaker,1
Damn calculus.,Oathbreaker,1
@Oathbreaker pretend you're a 15 th century mathematician and refuse to do any calculus on principle,RonInDune,1
LMFAO I wish,Oathbreaker,1
"@Trissin @RonInDune @Oathbreaker Just got on, is Last Wish still a possibility?",Thawxtem,1
yep!,Trissin,1
Let me know when you guys are good to go @Thawxtem @Oathbreaker @RonInDune,Trissin,1
Gonna be iffy for me,Oathbreaker,1
will we be in Raid - Alpha or making our own call?,Thawxtem,1
This is some annoying work that's due tomorrow,Oathbreaker,1
I'll see if I can really push hard but no promises,Oathbreaker,1

all good oath,Trissin,1
ty,Trissin,1
"I'm ready whenevs, just let me know because I'm leveling underused titan",Thawxtem,1
Will need to switch back to someone who can actually complete the raid,Thawxtem,1
Keep us updated if youre good @RonInDune !,Trissin,1
I'm free as well if you guys need a set of boots.,Samakain,1

"I'm really sorry, I'll be up in 15 or so minutes",RonInDune,1
np!,Trissin,1
"@Oathbreaker any idea if you'll be good to go by then? If not don't worry about it, you should focus on your work",Trissin,1
I believe we have 7atm with Sam,Trissin,1
"Likely not, this is a little rough. Maybe half hour if you guys still need me.",Oathbreaker,1
Apologies guys. Thought this would be a little quicker,Oathbreaker,1
"Np! No need to apologize, it's all good",Trissin,1
I'm coming on now,RonInDune,1
any possibility of getting help with the final encounter of shattered throne?,Arixama,1
@Trissin Yeah if you can group up without me go for it. Still gotta write the online test for this.,Oathbreaker,1
"I think i could give you a quick hand with it, just before we start our raid @Arixama",Trissin,1
"Don't want to keep you guys waiting, and if you've got 7 I'm more than willing to be the one who steps out!",Oathbreaker,1
"okay, good luck with your work!",Trissin,1
youre okay filling in for oath @Samakain ?,Trissin,1
"Sure, still a bit green on the raid as i've only done the first two encounters before. Hope that's not problem?",Samakain,1

"Another week, still no Transversive Steps FeelsBadMan",Oathbreaker,1
😦,Trissin,1
"Hey all, anyone down for trying a raid tonight or tomorrow?",RonInDune,1
Maybe Scourge if someone know how that works?,RonInDune,1
"I don't think I'm free tonight or tomorrow, sorry!!",Trissin,1
But I'd definitely love to do scourge sometime,Trissin,1
"All good! I agree, maybe next week for scourge?",RonInDune,1
"Give me some warning and yeah for sure, got some leave coming up and that'd be fun.",Samakain,1
"(Also, Jötunn dropped for me! whoooo!)",Samakain,1
"We can start organizing a group for scourge this weekend - when are people free, and what times work best?",Trissin,1
"For me, fri/sat night + sunday afternoon are ideal",Trissin,1
Sat night and Sunday afternoon/evening god for me,RonInDune,1
"Gonna try to solo Kalli today I think, or at least learn it. Anyone wants to stop by and watch me likely fail, just @ me and I'll give you a link to my twitch.",Oathbreaker,1
Oh dang I'm down,RonInDune,1

"Then used the armour forging consumable, dropped me second pair of gloves",RonInDune,1
I had a guy get his second jotunn drop,Arixama,1
Do we have enough people to try Scourge tonight?,RonInDune,1
I'm interested!,Trissin,1
"Time is not constant, we can push the start time around",Trissin,1

Timing works for me. Get home from work at 9pm EST.,Oathbreaker,1
Anybody here got division on pc?,Arixama,1
The first one? I do yeah.,RonInDune,1
Also got a spare key from this month's humble bundle.,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I've got the humble bundle key, so I was thinking of giving it another go. Tried it on Ps4 when they did the beta or whatever it was, and it was pretty fun there.",Arixama,1
Just didn't compete enough with other games at the time for me to pull the trigger on it,Arixama,1
I remember they had an absolutely fantastic trailer. The game didn't quite live up to that hype.,RonInDune,1
It also came out around the same. Time. As Witcher 3 I think,Arixama,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1
@danny,Trissin,1
Join the scourge event,Trissin,1
1 more for Scourge tonight? @PC,Trissin,1
"I also have Division on PC, though I played the absolute hell of out it for a while. My main character is basically min/maxed",Oathbreaker,1
Also just got home so give me all of like 2 minutes to get myself situated,Oathbreaker,1
np! 👍,Trissin,1
Any preferences on class I bring in?,Oathbreaker,1
3 warlocks would be nice,Trissin,1

"i think that's fine, we're still looking for a 6th",Trissin,1
Anybody know the fastest way to level up?,Arixama,1
Bribe bungie,RonInDune,1

Spider bounties work well,Oathbreaker,1
"If bribes worked, I wouldn't need to level 😂 I'd just have a new face",Arixama,1
Wanted bounties?,Arixama,1
Yes,Oathbreaker,1
lol does anybody have anyone for scourge?,Trissin,1
Nope lol,Oathbreaker,1
Nope,Arixama,1
Neither do I,RonInDune,1
"okay so how about this, Littlepants and I have a friend who is ready for last wish but not high enough light for Scourge",Trissin,1
"Littlepants suggested we do last wish first, so he can get some gear to increase his light, and then we can do scourge",Trissin,1
Yeah I'm fine with that!,RonInDune,1
Personally I'd be alright with that,Oathbreaker,1
Same,Arixama,1
Any chance of us trying Scourge or any other raid tonight?,RonInDune,1
I think we can complete Scourge today,Trissin,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1

No raid tonight for me unfortunately,Oathbreaker,1

Seems like it's not too hard to grind out?,Arixama,1
"no, it's quite fast actually",Trissin,1
I went up 30%  in the 2nd step then completely lost the plot and am down to 10% now. It'l be a long wait for me ...,RonInDune,1
oh no!,Trissin,1
Is that defeats in crucible?,Arixama,1
"Yeah your KDA matters, has to be atleast above 0.5",RonInDune,1
"It's pretty much the same as motes for malfeasance, right?",Arixama,1
"similar yeah, but I found this one to be faster than the motes",Trissin,1
"If I werent 20 hours deep in kh3, I'd be working on that. 😂",Arixama,1
Gotta do the Crucible medals part before the last mission,Oathbreaker,1
Then I get it,Oathbreaker,1
There we go.,Oathbreaker,1
Man the last couple of crucible games I played last night were full of players with last word/not forgotten/lunas.,RonInDune,1
Not very fun for someone as bad as me...,RonInDune,1
"Ron, you want to group up for a bit? We'll see if I can't try and help get you through this if you want",Oathbreaker,1
Are you free Friday evening onwards? I'm not sure I can log in till then...,RonInDune,1
Friday evening maybe. Let me check my work schedule. Hopefully don't work then,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah I'm good,Oathbreaker,1
"That offer also stands for anyone who wants a partner for this, by the way",Oathbreaker,1
TY TY!,RonInDune,1
"So I'll give my quick thoughts about the weapon: It's fun, it's real useful for shutting down rushes, but Ace can do just about everything The Last Word can, while having the most Hand Cannon range out of all viable options",Oathbreaker,1
"The one thing I like most about it though, is the hip-fire is useable",Oathbreaker,1
Last game I played I was able to hipfire down a charging Spectral Blade when he was weak,Oathbreaker,1
Hitting 51 to the body standard allows for some real nice cleanups,Oathbreaker,1
"So, after some really anecdotal evidence gathering, Ari and I have come to the conclusion that playing with someone who has a higher skill rating than you is extremely detrimental as the matchmaking likes to throw higher skilled players together. The matchmaking has little or  no regards to what team they're on, leading to some very one sided matches. As an example, we played a game on Retribution where I was the only diamond rated player (going off of DestinyTracker's ratings) on our team, with two or three diamond level players on the opposing team. He was at 1% after 3 matches. I left, he goes up to 12% in one match.",Oathbreaker,1
Do you know if scouts are viable now? It's a bit cheesy but it allows me to camp and rack up some points far without needing to be good enough with a sniper,RonInDune,1
Also did Whisper always one tap bodyshot in the crucible?,RonInDune,1
Scouts are eh right now still. Jade Rabbit works on some maps and some sight lines but others not so much,Oathbreaker,1
Also Whisper shouldn't be one shot bodying in the crucible unless they're standing in an Empowering Rift or Well of Radiance so no,Oathbreaker,1
Ahh I probably was in a rift then,RonInDune,1
"I like to use scouts, Polaris Lance is my go to",Trissin,1
"If my exotic is taken I'll just use the legendary version, the braytech one",Trissin,1
"Yeah, scouts can be good, but I just don't do well with them lol.",Oathbreaker,1
"It's a big preference thing, but it also depends on the map",Trissin,1
I can't run them on certain maps,Trissin,1
For sure. Equinox (the big open Nine focused one) is one I could run scouts or pulses on for sure.,Oathbreaker,1
I loooove equinox lol,Trissin,1
Oh man Equinox is the prettiest map. I wish I could just explore that one,RonInDune,1
I don't like it. I may be a sniper but there's no good angles. Only wide open spaces that allow for anyone to tag me with any damage and then massive amounts of flinch get involved.,Oathbreaker,1
What's the lore behind that map? Where did it come from and why is it all white?,RonInDune,1
"No clue, I don't think any of the Nine maps have been explained",Oathbreaker,1
When will trials be back again? Last time they were on I wasn't in a clan and never got to try it out...,RonInDune,1
Good question that no one knows the answers to,Oathbreaker,1
"^
Trials should come back",Trissin,1
It honestly should,Oathbreaker,1
No gimmicks,Oathbreaker,1
Just Trials,Oathbreaker,1
Also Rallies! I want my gravaton lance catalyst already.,Samakain,1
So I'm pretty sure I just got MOTW emblem.... Helped the runner up get some footage for the cinematic shots and DMG is asking if the list is complete and whatnot,Oathbreaker,1
😮,Trissin,1
lens of fate??,Trissin,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
nice!!!!,Trissin,1
Don't have it in my inventory just yet but TWAB came out like an hour and a bit ago,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah, I saw",Trissin,1
congrats! lol,Trissin,1
Thank you!,Oathbreaker,1
Damn dude congrats!,RonInDune,1
Congrats Oath!,Samakain,1
https://youtu.be/8t65PmubWQk,Oathbreaker,1
Also proud of this match,Oathbreaker,1
Is it supposed to be muted?,RonInDune,1
Yeah the audio is quiet for some reason,Oathbreaker,1
Wait,Oathbreaker,1
It's gone completely?,Oathbreaker,1
Oh boy.,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah',RonInDune,1
Troubleshooting time.,Oathbreaker,1
Think I've got the reason.,Oathbreaker,1
Oh man those sniper headshots are fine,RonInDune,1
"Yeah I know why, it'll be fixed for anything done next time",Oathbreaker,1
Can't re-upload because main file is having the same issue so.... RIP.,Oathbreaker,1
That's a fantastic match damn,RonInDune,1
Hey do you guys know if the Fastidious Miser triumph for ascnedant chests in the dreaming city is still bugged?,RonInDune,1
I just did all the chests and it still didn't open,RonInDune,1
RIP dude,Oathbreaker,1
Super annoying,RonInDune,1
"Also, anyone down for a Shattered Throne run?",RonInDune,1
Still need the Izanagai's...,RonInDune,1
Welp I just got it after returning to orbit,RonInDune,1
Anybody up for shattered throne?,Samakain,1
Yes!,RonInDune,1
I just tried soloing for the last 45 mins and got nowhere,RonInDune,1
Yeah I did that a day ago and it was awful,Samakain,1
haha,Samakain,1
i'm hunting eggs and bones in there so i hope you don't mind some jumping around?,Samakain,1
Oh no worries,RonInDune,1
Dow have 1 more?,RonInDune,1
"I'm just by myself, we should be ok with 2 but if someone wants that spot that'd be great",Samakain,1
Hm let me try once,RonInDune,1
@PC Anyone down for a shattered throne run?,RonInDune,1
"sorry I just saw this! I can help, sure",Trissin,1
"@Trissin Oh we finished it a bit ago, thanks though!",RonInDune,1
"If you're still up, I wouldn't mind some help with the Izanagi's quest steps",RonInDune,1
Yeah! What steps are you on?,Trissin,1
THe pyramidion,RonInDune,1
"oh, yeah i can help if you need",Trissin,1
although I think we might need a 3rd,Trissin,1
Hmm let's see,RonInDune,1
Well I'm ready whenever. Let's see if anyone else can drop in,RonInDune,1
ok,Trissin,1
maybe sam?,Trissin,1
OK I'll ask @Samakain,RonInDune,1
But I think he said he would be busy,RonInDune,1
ohh,Trissin,1
ok,Trissin,1
I got what I needed to done,Samakain,1
and I can jump in a nightfall if ya like @RonInDune,Samakain,1
Perfect thanks!,RonInDune,1
"Good to go, send me an invite when you're ready",Samakain,1
Come to realise that while i dislike the crucible. I very much enjoy Shaxx calling me a good boy,Samakain,1
Has anybody checked out anthem yet?,Arixama,1
Not me. Trying super hard to not spoil myself! Pre ordered and waiting.,RonInDune,1
I believe @Trissin might have?,RonInDune,1
"I played some of the first demo, but it was decently buggy. I think they've got another one coming up? And I'm hoping it'll be a bit more polished up.",Arixama,1
How much of the story is in it?,RonInDune,1
"I'm not super sure. It was mostly out of context anyway, but I'd guess that it's probably pretty early on if anything.",Arixama,1
"I'd guess it's kind of the way they did Andromeda, where you got to basically play the starting mission, and a good chunk of the first part of the first planet, but it's meant as more of a beta than a sneak peek.",Arixama,1
"That's good. I'm not expecting Destiny levels of gameplay out of it, but as long as I get some Bioware levels of story.",RonInDune,1
And pretty landscape to take screen shots of,RonInDune,1
There's definitely pretty landscapes. And I really enjoyed the combat.,Arixama,1
The only thing that was a little weird to me was the way the flight controlled,Arixama,1
Open beta ended yesterday unfortunately,Oathbreaker,1
I'll be honest I wasn't super impressed but it is still a cool game,Oathbreaker,1
"And to be completely fair, we didn't exactly get to endgame levels of gear and the fun that could bring",Oathbreaker,1
"I know people who did the vip demo, got access to four suits.",Arixama,1
"Yeah. I tried 3 out of the 4, wasn't super interested in Colossus. Interceptor was... Weird but okay? Kinda fun but wasn't too useful team wise. Ranger just felt like your stereotypical FPS kind of class. Storm was definitely fun and very useful.",Oathbreaker,1
So uh,Oathbreaker,1
Apparently there's 7 Nightfalls currently,Oathbreaker,1
Is strange terrain one?,Arixama,1
yep,Oathbreaker,1
Which I need to farm,Oathbreaker,1
_someone say **strange terrain**?_,Trissin,1
"Yep, back to 3 strikes though",Oathbreaker,1
"that's okay, is strange terrain still a nightfall for this week?",Trissin,1
"Yes, warden of nothing, pyramid ion and strange terrain I believe",Arixama,1
OH yeah I need Strange Terrain for the wayfarer weapon,RonInDune,1
ospreyyyyyyyyyy,Trissin,1
I also need the corrupted nightfall weapon for cursebreaker,RonInDune,1
"oh btw yes, I did get to play the anthem demo as well, I did try the colossus",Trissin,1
Anthem felt a **lot** like warframe,Trissin,1
and less like destiny,Trissin,1
Is that the pulse rifle? Horror's Least?,Trissin,1
Yup yup,RonInDune,1
Is that nightfall bug still working?,RonInDune,1
I dont think so,Trissin,1
but i havent checked,Trissin,1
"Aww well, since I'm 650 it won't be too hard to solo",RonInDune,1
"I would recommend you farm it with a group, you'll probably need a few completions before it drops",Trissin,1
True True,RonInDune,1
Well that's what I'll be doing this weekend then,RonInDune,1
Movie of the Week Emblem. Hell. Yes.,Oathbreaker,1
Congratulations man!,RonInDune,1
Thank you! Proud to be a part of something that won it.,Oathbreaker,1
"Next up, winner of a world's first race!",RonInDune,1
"LOL, I wish",Oathbreaker,1
Anybody up for a NF?,Samakain,1
"Press F to pay respects for Titan Skating everyone, getting worked on later this month",Oathbreaker,1
**NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO**,Trissin,1
Hahahaha,Oathbreaker,1
Scroll wheel skating might still work,Oathbreaker,1
They're trying to target the macros specifically,Oathbreaker,1
"Also they're mentioning that you can still skate, but tuned down to a much more manageable speed",Oathbreaker,1
>:c,Trissin,1
=f,Arixama,1
"Well nobody liked Titans anyway, so no big loss! 😋 😋",RonInDune,1
"yeah, i deleted a titan for another warlock. :rip:",Arixama,1
Warlocks rule! Titans drool!,RonInDune,1
_*banned_,Trissin,1
:uldren:,Arixama,1
"Hey clan, Hawthorne wanted me to say hi!",RonInDune,1
"Would anyone be interested in getting some time in the crucible for learning? Nomad, the guy who got me better at PvP is currently gauging interest on a sherpa session sometime soon, either next week or another time. What would likely happen is he plays some matches with you, finds any faults you have, gives you an explanation of the faults and what to do to work on them, and then you would play a few more matches. If anyone has any questions or is interested, DM or @ me and I can explain further. I did one of these back in late September with Nomad, and have played a hell of a lot of games with him since then while improving, so I do have some experience to this.",Oathbreaker,1
"He also just put out a video in his ""Crucible Doctor"" series on Youtube about how to shut down shotguns. Would be more than willing to post a link to the video.",Oathbreaker,1
Would anyone be willing to run a 2 person nightfall with me for Crimson Days/ Clan bounty?,Thawxtem,1
Hey @Thawxtem I'm down for that tonight and tomorrow night onwards!,RonInDune,1
Huh apparently you can 2 man the first part of the Scourge raid in like a minute,RonInDune,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iU7lNqlbK48&feature=youtu.be,RonInDune,1
We have to try it soon!,RonInDune,1
"OK, so since it's technically anthem pc release day (conditions apply) I wanted to see who @here has plans to pick it up in some capacity, whether that's buying the game or paying for origin access premier?",Arixama,1
I have it and it's preloading,RonInDune,1
"i don't have premiere, so I don't think I can play it until next week",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, it's a bit silly really.",Arixama,1
"I've seen games do like a couple days early for pre-ordering the deluxe edition, but a full week for their subscription service is kinda ridiculous",Arixama,1
"1. Waiting on general feedback before making the decision.
2. Pretty sure you can do the Origin Access premier trial for it but I could be wrong",Oathbreaker,1
"Ea access premier has a 10 hour demo on xbox, origin access has the full game",Arixama,1
Hey so are you guys free for some Crimson days stuff this weekend?,RonInDune,1
I know @Thawxtem wanted i couple of days back t but I didn't have time...,RonInDune,1
ANyone @PC  down for a quick nightfall ? Really wanna get the final crimson days item...,RonInDune,1
Give me a minute and I can log in,Oathbreaker,1
Oh thanks so much!,RonInDune,1
"No mic for me though, late here and people are trying to sleep",Oathbreaker,1
Oh no worries,RonInDune,1
Will of the Thousands with solar/heavyweight sound good?,Oathbreaker,1
Just need to complete the nightfall,RonInDune,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
Logging in right now,Oathbreaker,1
Is anyone down for a couple of shatter throne runs today or tomorrow? I have ada-1 bounty that needs it...,RonInDune,1
Oh man the reckoning looks so beautiful damn!,RonInDune,1
Finally something to do with the Nine that's not solely PvP,RonInDune,1
yesss haha,Trissin,1
The glowing armour sets look like the ones we had in the event before Forsaken  dropped,RonInDune,1
"yeah, solstice of heroes",Trissin,1
Yup that,RonInDune,1
Also Season of Opulence! We're going back to the Leviathan I feel like.,RonInDune,1
yes!! that will be really fun,Trissin,1
im more excited for that one haha,Trissin,1
i really like the calus theme and stuff,Trissin,1
Reddit was saying people were SRL merch so that might be a surprise waiting for us,RonInDune,1
ooooooh interesting!,Trissin,1
thats a good observation,Trissin,1
I forgot there was no raid this season,RonInDune,1
"Opulence is definitely going back to leviathan, the penumbra teases when they were first talking about  the annual pass had multiple leviathan set pieces.",Arixama,1
I thing reckoning is supposed to be the raid-like activity,Arixama,1
Maybe like a shattered throne type but with the timer from the Halloween activity,RonInDune,1
There's a power increase too right?,RonInDune,1
Yup. 700 I believe,Arixama,1
Nice,RonInDune,1
I'm excited for the allegiance quest,Arixama,1
What's that?,RonInDune,1
that's not thorn is it,Trissin,1
how could one possibly be excited for thorn,Trissin,1
What's Thorn like?,RonInDune,1
death,Trissin,1
I think it's separate. You get to choose between vanguard and drifter alliance on your characters,Arixama,1
The pic looks like Malfeasance and that's no very nice,RonInDune,1
oooooh interesting,Trissin,1
I wonder if I can play both sides with different characters,RonInDune,1
Lore wise thorn is one of the weapons that would straight up kill guardians in the crucible,Arixama,1
also not lore wise,Trissin,1
because it does straight up kill guardians in the crucible,Trissin,1
"It's character based and not account based, so it would seem so",Arixama,1
lol,Trissin,1
"Nah, that would require it to uninstall the game and delete your account",Arixama,1
Oh yeah the gun used by shin Dredgen Yor,RonInDune,1
Damn I should try to get Dredgen this week to prepare then,RonInDune,1
this week is the week to do it,Trissin,1
"Yeah I need one more reset, 6 light vs light kills, and 1 more invasion team wipe",RonInDune,1
I'll be grinding this weekend,RonInDune,1
oh im also stuck on light vs light lol,Trissin,1
glad it was made easier 😃,Trissin,1
"or, wait, no, it's going to be easier starting next week",Trissin,1
I once messaged a guy to ask him to invade and pop super so I could try to kill him as I was the only one in my team for some reason and didn't want to quit,RonInDune,1
did he do it?,Trissin,1
"He agreed, so that's how I got 4 kills",RonInDune,1
Nice dude,RonInDune,1
ohhhh what that's so nice!!!,Trissin,1
nobody invades with super anymore....,Trissin,1
Exactly!,RonInDune,1
"I'm currently in pvp hell, so I'd be willing to do some gambit at somepoint. 🤣😭",Arixama,1
i see you've been grinding some competitive,Trissin,1
how is it?,Trissin,1
Comp is weird though I was matchmade with an entire team of 150 light players with green weapons,RonInDune,1
It;s kinda broken,RonInDune,1
It doesn't reset my Valor winstreak and I'm making progress on Lunas sort of,Arixama,1
Ooh nice,RonInDune,1
lol that's good,Trissin,1
I got my first hatemail when I was using contraverse holds in comp,RonInDune,1
Now with last word out it doesn't help all that much,RonInDune,1
Unfortunately the sweats are all back in quick play and rumble so I cant get my win streak back up to five after my last reset.,Arixama,1
So im currently running on a 2 winstreak,Arixama,1
I find it's easier to get back up to 5 winstreak in rumble,Trissin,1
if youre playing solo that is,Trissin,1
"Also, didn't they change it? You don't actually have to place 1st anymore",Trissin,1
I've just been super unlucky and gotten in to rumble matches with a bunch of sweats so I can't manage a podium finish.,Arixama,1
You have to get at least 3rd in rumble to up the streak,Arixama,1
ohh,Trissin,1
:S,Trissin,1
I'm on my fifth reset though. Progress.,Arixama,1
"oh my god, yeah",Trissin,1
better get it done soon!!,Trissin,1
Like I said. Pvp hell. 🤣🤣 It's pretty much all I've been doing the past week.,Arixama,1
I do wish there was a way to see you're streaks for the different activities,Arixama,1
!heatmap Arixama#1187,Trissin,1
wdym streaks?,Trissin,1
"Like the win streaks for comp, quick play and gambit",Arixama,1
i thought there was an emblem for trhat?,Trissin,1
Probably,Arixama,1
There's one for longest streak but not current,Arixama,1
ohh ok,Trissin,1
YEEEESSSSSSS,Arixama,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
ITS A GOOD DAY BOYS,Arixama,1
The art is so nice!,RonInDune,1
FINAL PUSH TO BROADSWORD,Arixama,1
You can dew it!,RonInDune,1
W00t,RonInDune,1
@PC,Arixama,1
👍👍👍👍👍👍,Trissin,1
Well my biggest achievement today was finally getting my 3rd reset:,RonInDune,1
Now i just need 6 more light v light kills for dredgen,RonInDune,1
I still haven't gotten a reset in infamy. 💀,Arixama,1
Definitely gunna get omsome next season though.,Arixama,1
"Yeah it's easy, just some time consuming grinding",RonInDune,1
"I'll never get redrix or lunas, so this is something I can just mindlessly make progress towards",RonInDune,1
Oh damn loads of people finish up some weapons today: i just saw two people get lunas in the towers,RonInDune,1
"Redrix is actually not terribly awful to get. It definitely takes some grinding, but most of the steps are pretty simple to accomplish",Arixama,1
I'm in this step:,RonInDune,1
"Gotta check how much further, I never looked it up",RonInDune,1
"That's mountaintop, the grenade launcher. redrix is the orange one.",Arixama,1
Oh so this one then:,RonInDune,1
Yep. Pulse precisions are probably the hardest step besides the 5 resets I'd say.,Arixama,1
"The only one that really kind of disheartening is doing 25 of each type of match. Quick play, rumble and comp",Arixama,1
Oh damn,RonInDune,1
I though 40 matches of gmabit was hard,RonInDune,1
That's the only thing I've got left on breakneck. I need like 16 or so.,Arixama,1
Then I'll be rerolling up a titan.,Arixama,1
Why reroll?,RonInDune,1
I rolled up a new warlock cause my old one looked stupid. Deleted my titan to do it. Breakneck is the only thing I have left to complete on dumblock.,Arixama,1
Then his stupid face shall be sent into the void,Arixama,1
"Haha I know that feel, my hunter looks like she did her makeup in the dark",RonInDune,1
I wish they'de add face customization,RonInDune,1
Maybe they will at somepoint now that they're not under Activisions thumb,Arixama,1
I've heard Activision wasn't the worst publisher they could end up with. Atleast they didn't suffer like Anthem on release.,RonInDune,1
It took a couple weeks for vanilla d2 to suffer really. There was a decent amount of issues people had right from the get go though.,Arixama,1
"It didn't brick ps4s though, so that's a step up from anthem 🎇",Arixama,1
"I quite like the game, it's just buggier than a sewer mattress",RonInDune,1
I was planning on alternating between D2 and Anthem for the next several months.,RonInDune,1
"Now, oh well",RonInDune,1
"I haven't played a lot of anthem. I just got the little social space. It's unsurprising it's a buggy mess though. EA wanted to capitalize on the destiny/division game style, took a team in the middle of working on one game and started them on a rush job for another game. 🤷‍♂️",Arixama,1
That said I do love the flight mechanic and Id love if anthem and destiny just had a baby.,Arixama,1
"Also they are so much better at worldbuilding and telling stories, it just seems like a waste of everyones time.",RonInDune,1
Even the little snippets in anthem are pretty good!,RonInDune,1
Just ... sigh,RonInDune,1
But goddamn does it make me appreciate just how good destiny's shooting is,RonInDune,1
Peerless,RonInDune,1
Honestly between anthem and Andromeda I'm starting to worry about dragon age.,Arixama,1
"Me too. Andromeda is in a better place now, but now Anthem? Scary trend. 

Atleast Bungie has never let us down.",RonInDune,1
Hey everyone!  What have I missed with my too-long of a break from Destiny?  Haven't played since the launch of Black Armory,Peronix,1
Well you're back just in time for new content,Oathbreaker,1
"Since Black Armory launch, the newest raid has launched (Scourge of the Past), the remainder of the Forges have been opened, an endgame-ish activity has been opened (Niobe Labs), and The Last Word has been released back into Destiny via a Quest called ""The Draw""",Oathbreaker,1
"With today's launch of Joker's Wild, a new version of Gambit will be launched (called Gambit Prime, a single round with specialized armor giving players specific roles within the Gambit Prime environment), a new endgame PvE activity called the Reckoning will be launched shortly which we have very little information about. Next week, we'll begin an ""Allegiance Quest"" where we can choose to side with the Vanguard or the Drifter (this is character based so you can experience both sides of the quest). Soon, the Thorn will return in another quest as well. No raid for this season.",Oathbreaker,1
Someone please let me know if I've missed something.,Oathbreaker,1
"oof, that's a lot!  Well, looks like I need to catch up on the grind ha",Peronix,1
The grind won't be horrible. Bungie added some bounties that are intended to bring you up to 640 light to help get you into Joker's Wild content faster.,Oathbreaker,1
Also Bungie gave everyone a free Gjallarhorn at the end of Black armoury.,RonInDune,1
"What I can say is that Scourge is a very fun raid, shorter than last wish but still very cool. The remainder of the forges are okay, there are some weapons I'd recommend grinding for good rolls on, otherwise you're not missing much. Two of the Black Armory exotic weapons drop from the forges, the third is completed from a quest.",Oathbreaker,1
I wish Ron lmao,Oathbreaker,1
"Anyways, The Last Word is very similar to its Destiny 1 Y3 iteration where it is nowhere near the stable laser that it was in Y1, though within about 25m it is one of the best hand cannons in the game for PvP. We don't know much, if anything at all about the Thorn and its effectiveness in PvP just yet, but it already appears to be different from Destiny 1",Oathbreaker,1
"Niobe Labs is more of an optional endgame activity, think Shattered Throne but only rewarding cosmetic rewards rather than gear or weapons. That being said, it is still a very cool activity that took the community a couple of days to solve, and only after some help from Bungie.",Oathbreaker,1
Cosmetics are my kryptonite so I'll definitely need to do that.,Peronix,1
"Man, balancing this, Sekiro, and The Division 2 is going to be a good time",Peronix,1
Oh I can imagine lmao,Oathbreaker,1
"So, I have a similar question to @Peronix, I have a cousin who wants to branch out from Fortnite/COD and I want to introduce her to D2. Do you think it's a good time now or should I wait for Penumbra?",RonInDune,1
I'd say now since there's less content to catch up on than if she wanted to start on Penumbra,Peronix,1
I'd say now personally.,Oathbreaker,1
"Alright, I'll get her a copy then. Thanks guys!",RonInDune,1
No problem!,Peronix,1
Holy butts: “Light vs. Light” can now be progressed by killing any Guardian (not just invaders) using a Super; this makes attaining Dredgen a less daunting task,RonInDune,1
This is amazing! I can finally get dredgen,RonInDune,1
@here any chance of getting a raid group together this weekend?,Arixama,1
"I’ll be traveling till Sunday afternoon, but I’m down from then on",RonInDune,1
I'm interested! I've been really busy with school lately but I think I've got some time this weekend.,Trissin,1
What were you thinking of running @Arixama ?,Trissin,1
"Preferably last wish and scourge if we can manage it, but I'd at least like to do that last encounter of last wish.",Arixama,1
Absolutely. With or without le fromage?,Trissin,1
Actually learning the encounter once is probably a good idea 🤣,Arixama,1
Let's see if we can get a group together,Trissin,1
What's recommended light on scourge?,Arixama,1
630ish?,Oathbreaker,1
Minimum?,Oathbreaker,1
"Awesome, so I can easily pull my brother through the power surge bounties and have him raid ready",Arixama,1
"Yeah, youre right",Trissin,1
Power surge is a great way to prep for scourge,Trissin,1
"Alright, let's see if there's interest in raiding today",Trissin,1
"Last Wish + Scourge, it looks like?",Trissin,1
What time will you be back Ron?,Trissin,1
Time zones are confusing,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
"I'm about to board from Las Vegas right now, so I'll probably be ready to raid in around 6 hours?",RonInDune,1
Okay,Trissin,1
I should be home. Around 545 cst and then if we do the quick power surge bounties for @TheCnC he should be able to be raid ready quickly,Arixama,1
How big is the update BTW? Cause I haven't launched the game in a week.,RonInDune,1
"I don't think it was too bad, it wasn't very big",Trissin,1
Perfect thanks,RonInDune,1
I think it was like. 4 gigs or so?,Arixama,1
5 gigs from memory,Oathbreaker,1
Also I'm a hard *maybe*,Oathbreaker,1
"I have math quizzes and such to do that are due tomorrow at 11am, and some SolidWorks projects that are due tomorrow in class, so I want to jumpstart those",Oathbreaker,1
no problem 👍,Trissin,1

Hey guys anyone down for a couple of Shattered Throne runs tonight?,RonInDune,1
I have a bounty running out soon,RonInDune,1
"I'm thinking about maybe organizing a raid today, if people are interested",Trissin,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1
"Fuck, Fridays are the worst days for me",Arixama,1
"Ohhh, crap",Trissin,1
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Drdl86gU0AM-gd8.jpg,RonInDune,1
@PC Any interest in Scourge of the Past this weekend?,Trissin,1
"Also last wish, possibly",Trissin,1
*raises hand*,RonInDune,1
I’m in for both.,Matos,1
Hey @Trissin do you think it'd be possible to play with someone in the Asia region? Or will the ping be too high?,RonInDune,1
"hmm, i havent tried it!",Trissin,1
"@PC If anybody is interested in raiding! Time is flexible, we can adjust it as needed.",Trissin,1
when are you planning it for?,Matos,1
"Around 45 ish minutes form now, I think?",RonInDune,1
"earlier is fine with me, but we're missing 2",Trissin,1
Doing some scrims otherwise I'd join :/,Oathbreaker,1
What are 'scrims'?,RonInDune,1
In this particular instance pvp practice,Arixama,1
Scrimmages,Arixama,1
Ohh,RonInDune,1
Thanks,RonInDune,1
Is there a time that would work better for you @Oathbreaker ?,Trissin,1
I wouldn't mind changing the time,Trissin,1
We're going till 10:45 my time and with work tomorrow timing is rough regardless,Oathbreaker,1
@Trissin,Oathbreaker,1
"okay, no worries",Trissin,1
"Well it looks like we don't have enough for tonight, sorry guys @Arixama @RonInDune @Matos",Trissin,1
Can you guys help with the thorn quest finale then?,RonInDune,1
If you guys are only down one I can be available to be drug along,TheCnC,1
"haha we're missing 2, but thanks for the offer cnc",Trissin,1
what is the thorn quest finale @RonInDune ?,Trissin,1
"The final, realy hard mission",RonInDune,1
I think it's a heroic savathun's song,RonInDune,1
Also has specific enemies you have to kill similar to the exotic sword quests from d1,Arixama,1
"ohh, i see",Trissin,1
how many people is it,Trissin,1
"I've heard it's hard to solo, so I've been watiing tll some people were free",RonInDune,1
3 I think,RonInDune,1
"3, but I don't know if you can do it without being on that step",Arixama,1
well lets see,Trissin,1
It's called a strike so maybe I can pull people into it,RonInDune,1
How far are you from the thorn end @Trissin,RonInDune,1
wondering if it's like izanagi's where it won't let us join unless we're on that step,Trissin,1
"i havent done anything for thorn lol, i think im on the titan step",Trissin,1
Ohh so the Escalation protocols,RonInDune,1
blind well actually,Trissin,1
Oh yeah that one is a long one,RonInDune,1
actually i don't find it's too bad,Trissin,1
i think 1 game of crucible got me to 27,Trissin,1
or maybe it was 2 games? i dont remember,Trissin,1
After thee final step I never want to play crucible again lol,RonInDune,1
lool,Trissin,1
Hey @PC I need some help with the Thorn strike 'Chasm of Screams.' Is anyone available?,RonInDune,1
hey @Samakain @TheCnC would you guys be interested in doing scourge of the past tonight?,Trissin,1
https://braytech.org,Trissin,1
Holy crap guys I just got two exotics from completing a gambit match,RonInDune,1
Karnstein and getaway artist,RonInDune,1
Niiiiice,Arixama,1
anything going down tonight>,Matos,1
I'm down for raids/niobe labs/whatever,RonInDune,1
dont think there's anything planned at the moment,Trissin,1
if we can get 6 together im happy to do scourge,Trissin,1
"id be down for something but until thats decided, i got legos",Arixama,1
@PC Is there anybody interested in raiding tonight?,Trissin,1
Yes!,RonInDune,1
"in a LW now, but down for whatever if there is enough people",Matos,1
"this  pug sucks, @Trissin save me!",Matos,1
oh nooooo RIP,Trissin,1
all done,Matos,1
still dont have 6 :\,Trissin,1
Did you get 1KV?,RonInDune,1
negative,Matos,1
"barely any upgrades, 2 pieces that were +1",Matos,1
LW doesn't seem very rewarding,Matos,1
anyone for gambit/prime?,Matos,1
Just got home from taking care of drunk friends at a St Patty's day part so I'm a little drained to be honest,Oathbreaker,1
"all good, we can do the raid next weekend",Trissin,1
Sounds like a plan,Oathbreaker,1
i thought most people were partying yesterday because classes tomorrow,Trissin,1
I don't have the smartest friends,Oathbreaker,1
We'll just go with that,Oathbreaker,1
lool hope theyre doing alright,Trissin,1
"I got the ones I was responsible for home safe, the others are home too. So all good hahaha.",Oathbreaker,1
Anyone down for a SOTP run?,Morton,1
"welcome! i dont think many people are on atm, lots are on CT",Trissin,1
"ya, it's a bit late i know.",Morton,1
Yes!!! Finally got it,Trissin,1
Oxygen SR3,Trissin,1
Niiiiice,Arixama,1
I had to solo Will of the Thousands like 12 times but worth,Trissin,1
"my loadout is now pretty much set, i recently got a good threat level with trench barrel",Trissin,1
😄,Trissin,1
What else is on it?,Arixama,1
"smallbore barrel is okay, accurized rounds is nice, grave robber is pretty situational but I like it",Trissin,1
"especially with tons of adds around, no need to reload",Trissin,1
"I've got trench barrel and quick draw. I don't super use  it, but I've got it if I need it",Arixama,1
Dang @Trissin Great work! I'll grind nightfalls when The Corrupted is back for sure,RonInDune,1
"Right, for the horror's least pulse rifle right? for cursebreaker",Trissin,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
I have so much gridning to do to get titles,RonInDune,1
Gotta grind Strang terrain for the weapon and EPs for the shotgun,RonInDune,1
ohh true yeah,Trissin,1
that osprey eluded me for a little while,Trissin,1
"and also I think EP is much easier to do now than it was before, we wouldn't need a team of 9 lol",Trissin,1
Definitely not. Could easily do just a team of three with a well and some thunderlords,Arixama,1
"yep, what EP weapons do u need ron?",Trissin,1
SNiper and shotty,RonInDune,1
So any chance of us running raids this weekend?,RonInDune,1
I probably can't do one tonight unless it decently late. But I could do one tomorrow,Arixama,1
@PC anybody else up for a raid tomorrow some time?,Arixama,1
Yup tonight or tomorrow!,RonInDune,1
"Work tomorrow, and sick today so no clue if I'd be able to at all",Oathbreaker,1
Oh I hope you feel better @Oathbreaker !,RonInDune,1
I'm down for anytime this weekend,Matos,1
Man the gambit prime weekly bounty is a craphsoot. I was on 12 the lost like 5 games in a row and went to 0 points,RonInDune,1
This feels harder than getting the last word solo,RonInDune,1
ari and I knocked that out in a great streak,Matos,1
i'm down for gambit if you need help,Matos,1
I'm just bad unfortunately,RonInDune,1
"I did 5 games of comp and lost 4, including one 4 v 2",RonInDune,1
I'm having supper right now but I'll play again in like 20 mins,RonInDune,1
any raids happening today?,Matos,1
"Nothing is planned at the moment, but we can see if anyone @PC is interested",Trissin,1
I am!,RonInDune,1
So Matos Ron and I are. Anybody else?,Arixama,1
Currently trying to see if we can gather 2 more,Trissin,1
Do we have a time frame?,Arixama,1
Can we LFG if noone else is free?,RonInDune,1
"No time yet, when are you guys free?",Trissin,1
"Also, what raid are we doing?",Trissin,1
Scourge?,Trissin,1
Im good after 515 ish,Arixama,1
"Scourge, and if we have time later something else",RonInDune,1
"Scourge is faster, but I would definitely like to do a riven encounter if we've got the time",Arixama,1
Cnc is a maybe,Arixama,1
Has Bungie upped the drop rates on Dreaming City cosmetics yet?,RonInDune,1
I believe that was this past tuesday,Arixama,1
Great maybe I can finally get ship and 1KV,RonInDune,1
wait they upped the drop rate on 1k??,Trissin,1
😮,Trissin,1
I know they plan to. Don't know if it is already,Arixama,1
hmmmm im not sure how I feel about that,Trissin,1
I don't know if it's actually drop rate or if it drop prote tion similar to nightfall weapons and ep weapons,Arixama,1
Because there are people who have like 100 clears and it still hasn't dropped,Arixama,1
"yeah, like RioT and those yeah",Trissin,1
i dont think theres anyone with >100 though,Trissin,1
highest i've heard of is about 70,Trissin,1
"which, still, is ridiculous of course",Trissin,1
I think drop protection makes sense but I don't think they should just straight up buff the drop rate,Trissin,1
Im definitely ok with buffing the drop rate based on completions,Arixama,1
"^
thats fine",Trissin,1
Sometimes I miss the D1 engram system. I liked knowing what slot something was going to be in,Arixama,1
We need like two more people right?,RonInDune,1
Yes,Trissin,1
and I was actually wondering if people might be interested in Spire,Trissin,1
I always love spire,RonInDune,1
And I thing @Matos hadn't done it yet,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, it's a fun one, would love to take him thru it",Trissin,1
Plus I need to run a prestige Levi for the final acrius step,RonInDune,1
"oh, I do need to prestige leviathan as well, for a chance at the acrius catalyst",Trissin,1
What does the catalyst do?,RonInDune,1
"I believe it increases mag size from 2 to 6, and also increases reload speed",Trissin,1
the increase in reload speed is pretty significant,Trissin,1
That's a massive change holy cow,RonInDune,1
yeah haha,Trissin,1
It's up in the air if I actually have access to prestige lev,Arixama,1
Pretty sure you need to do one regular levi before prestige,Oathbreaker,1
I dunno though I'm out of action still,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeee, I definitely don't have access on my warlock. I *might* on my hunter",Arixama,1
lool,Trissin,1
I'll check when I get home,Arixama,1
i'm down for any of this stuff,Matos,1
just ping me,Matos,1
i do have access to prestige lev on my hunter,Arixama,1
Blood hell solo comp is the *worst*,RonInDune,1
:((,Trissin,1
"Hey pc plebs, thinking about joining the ranks and building/buying a pc.  Would anyone have any recommendations for parts to pick or a prebuilt thats half decent.   Looking to hopefully spend less than 900cad for everything",wpgjets92,1
"Prebuilts aren't the best route to go these days, though every so often a decent one pops up on r/bapcsalescanada. In terms of parts, right now is a pretty good time to get into building on the Canada side. The Ryzen side of things is a good bet for a CPU, though with a new Ryzen lineup coming soon™ you may want to wait. Intel CPU's are more expensive generally unless you're willing to go for a used model, but even then, they can be a little pricey for my tastes. AMD's GPU line-up I have very little experience with so I do not know what performance is like with them, I've been an Nvidia guy from my first build on. Nvidia just released a 1660/1660ti which I believe lines up somewhere around a 2060 in terms of how well it runs, but just on 10xx series architecture. $900 CDN should get you a pretty solid build going these days",Oathbreaker,1
"As an example, I just threw this together in about 5 minutes. I did go over your budget but there are some corners to be cut here and there: https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/8bmGCb",Oathbreaker,1
"Awesome.  Thank you, ill take a look at it after.  Would you recommend going with a ssd for a boot drive",wpgjets92,1
Definitely,Arixama,1
If you get a decent sized one I'd also recommend putting the games you play regularly on there,Arixama,1
"Yeah, if you can afford it go for it, I love my SSD.",Oathbreaker,1
I was thinking like a 120 or 40gb,wpgjets92,1
250 lol,wpgjets92,1
A 250 not a 40?,Arixama,1
"That's what I have, and it pretty much has my Ps and destiny and whatever apps just defaultly install there",Arixama,1
"Also, Nvidia is bringing RTX to some of their 10xx series as well so you don't have to splurge on a 2080 to get that",RonInDune,1
It depends on whether you're aiming for 4K 60+ fps or standard 1080p 60+fps,RonInDune,1
Well for the past year and a bit ive been gaming on a ps4 pro at 1080p 60fps so id like to bump it to atleast 1080p 80+ fps,wpgjets92,1
"Then if you can manage the power requirements and the slightly higher price, the 2060 is the way to go I think",RonInDune,1
"so i was playing around a bit and based off of the earlier build (trying to cut cost a bit) i came up with this https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/list/LFr6Hh, also while on my way home browsing kijiji i came across this link https://www.kijiji.ca/v-desktop-computers/winnipeg/gtx-1060-with-led-case-affordable-gaming-computer/1422911723?enableSearchNavigationFlag=true and was thinking it may be worthwhile to start with a used system and upgrade where needed?",wpgjets92,1
What're you planning on playing on it?,Arixama,1
"probably starting with apex, fortnite, maybe d2 if its still cheap (since its apparently much better on pc then console)",wpgjets92,1
probably play halo when that comes out,wpgjets92,1
I've got a 1060 3gb and it definitely runs d2 well. Not sure about fortnite or apex outside of the tutorial,Arixama,1
"For some future proofing a 6 gig 1060 would be better, but this still a powerful setup",RonInDune,1
"I've no idea about the processor, but I'd definitely at least upgrade the ram",Arixama,1
Just looked into it and it doesnt look to bad but it a chip from 2011,wpgjets92,1
oh my god i got it,Trissin,1
one eyed mask,Trissin,1
the last forsaken exotic i've been missing,Trissin,1
Bet xur sells it this week 😂,Arixama,1
"Personally I'd be looking to upgrade from an i5-2400 Jets, but that would mean having to upgrade the motherboard to something newer, alongside the RAM, just so you can buy a newer CPU. It can be a little expensive but I also don't know how well that particular chip performs on games.",Oathbreaker,1
"Also, the PCPartPicker list you posted is pretty good. You can technically get away with 8GB of RAM as most things list that as the minimum, but 16 is become a little more common for certain programs and games (but still not super common). The GTX 1050ti is a card my buddy had for a while and he liked it, solid card for that price, it would be the first thing I'd recommend upgrading from when you have the chance.",Oathbreaker,1
Ive gone through and have been making so many different combos of parts to see what i can throw together with better parts but at a half decent price,wpgjets92,1
Friendly reminder that The Corrupted is on nf rotation this week!,Trissin,1
Heck yeah!,RonInDune,1
Anyone down for some grinding that one?,RonInDune,1
I might be interested! Depends how busy I get,Trissin,1
i defintely would be,Arixama,1
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/470073821110599680/560187355907227648/Destiny_2_Screenshot_2019.03.26_-_14.44.06.91.png,Arixama,1
Congrats Ari! Are you the first in our clan to get to 700?,RonInDune,1
at least on the pc side i think,Arixama,1
Damn dude nice going,RonInDune,1
👍👍👍,Trissin,1
I'm still like 694ish,RonInDune,1
!rank maxpower,Arixama,1
"yeah, unless matos hit it last night, i think im the first. hes been right on my heels the whole time, i thought he was gunna beat me to it",Arixama,1
I've been playing too much PvP to be getting big light gains lmao,Oathbreaker,1
I do wish there was a way to filter the bot so it did pc only,Arixama,1
i wonder if it would work if u just added pc?,Trissin,1
!rank maxpower pc,Trissin,1
lol rip,Trissin,1
"Hmm, maybe the !pve command? for all PC clan members?",RonInDune,1
!pve,RonInDune,1
Let's try again:,RonInDune,1
!pve,RonInDune,1
"Nah I just got home now from work, still 699",Matos,1
Huh I did not know that the the nightfall weapon drop chance goes up everytime you don't get it,RonInDune,1
Wish it worked that way for EP,RonInDune,1
it does,Arixama,1
For EP as well?,RonInDune,1
yup,Arixama,1
"its not a lot, but it does",Arixama,1
Dang it I always gave up after 3 or 4 attempts,RonInDune,1
i think they implemented it the same time they put in the start from wave 6 thing,Arixama,1
I don't need the keys to get the weapons right?,RonInDune,1
I might finally get the shotgun thsit iem then,RonInDune,1
"nope, just killing the boss",Arixama,1
any raids happening this week?,Matos,1
WE just need a couple more people I feel like,RonInDune,1
"Littlepants is getting his new laptop on Friday, he might be able to join us then",Trissin,1
We're always just missing 1 or 2,Trissin,1
I'm a maybe,Oathbreaker,1
Depends on how I'm feeling and if I get things done efficiently,Oathbreaker,1
Is this week's double points for comp as well? Or only for regular crucible?,RonInDune,1
Believe it's Valor only,Oathbreaker,1
There's never been double Glory,Oathbreaker,1
Aww I thought I could make a try for Fabled,RonInDune,1
Oh well,RonInDune,1
Give a go anyways man,Oathbreaker,1
This season has better Glory gains in comparison to previous seasons,Oathbreaker,1
Huh I didn't know that,RonInDune,1
I keep getting to heroic and then dropping back,RonInDune,1
think I once had a 7 game loss streak that dropped me 3 ranks,RonInDune,1
I've had two sessions of comp and I'm around 1400,Oathbreaker,1
Holy cow,RonInDune,1
"You're pretty, pretty good",RonInDune,1
My worst session was a 3v1 that we still somehow lost cause the other guy was a god,RonInDune,1
3v1 depending on the mode can favor the solo,Oathbreaker,1
"Survival especially, because you have so many lives and can farm out the weaker players on the other team",Oathbreaker,1
Even clash really,Oathbreaker,1
Dude had a handcannon whose name I can't remember that had as good as or maybe better range range than my blast furnace,RonInDune,1
it was survival yeah,RonInDune,1
"Eh, Blast Furnace outranges all Hand Cannons",Oathbreaker,1
"It was the mercury map, so I probably shouldn't have been using pulse rifles anyway",RonInDune,1
The only two that can give a little bit of a fight are Not Forgotten and Ace,Oathbreaker,1
"Like at extreme range, that is",Oathbreaker,1
I think it was not forgotten,RonInDune,1
That's one of the pinnacle weapons right?,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, that's the 5500 hand cannon",Oathbreaker,1
oh great,RonInDune,1
that's a wee bit hard to get then lol,RonInDune,1
"I think I'm on the quest for that though, need to get comp hand cannon kills",RonInDune,1
Likely Luna's,Oathbreaker,1
You need to get Luna's before you get Not Forgotten's quest,Oathbreaker,1
ohhhh,RonInDune,1
dang ok so not forgotten user are legit good players,RonInDune,1
For the most part,Oathbreaker,1
then why do they get matched with people on low glory?,RonInDune,1
Kinda unfair,RonInDune,1
"There are players who have bought the gun, or cheese comp matchmaking for it",Oathbreaker,1
"Eh, if it's early in the season they're not 5500 ranked anymore",Oathbreaker,1
Wait you can buy the gun?,RonInDune,1
"""Buy""",Oathbreaker,1
Like Eververse?,RonInDune,1
"No, god no",Oathbreaker,1
Basically you pay someone $350ish and upwards to go on your account and get you to 5500 and do the quest for you,Oathbreaker,1
$350!!!!,RonInDune,1
The hell,RonInDune,1
That was the lowest I've heard of,Oathbreaker,1
Mostly around $500,Oathbreaker,1
Man people have too much money and too little sense,RonInDune,1
If it was $15 I might've considered,RonInDune,1
Or like I can send the guy Pizza or something,RonInDune,1
"I know someone who wants to pay for it, I've repeatedly told him he's an idiot because if he improves he can realistically get to 5500",Oathbreaker,1
"I plan on making a 5500 run this season or next, I want the gun",Oathbreaker,1
Good luck! You're one of the few who's legit good enough to get it!,RonInDune,1
"I'm still working on redrix, need a bunch of arc kills. Wondering what's a good weapon for that",RonInDune,1
"Hand Cannon: Waking Vigil, Jack Queen King 3, Nation of Beasts
Shotgun: Badlander, Good Bone Structure (only if you're confident with your shot and comfortable with slug shotguns), fusions are *okay* but wouldn't recommend
Heavy: Wardcliff, Play of the Game, Legend of Acrius, Thunderlord",Oathbreaker,1
Not super familiar with any other options so,Oathbreaker,1
Don't quite know,Oathbreaker,1
"Ooh Jack Queen is the mercury weapon, literally never used it",RonInDune,1
But I do have a good waking vigil roll might try that one,RonInDune,1
Is dragonfly in good in PvP though?,RonInDune,1
*any good,RonInDune,1
"For Hunters, arcstrider is okay, not my pick personally. Titans have top or Middle tree arc, and I've seen some players bringing back top tree Stormcaller",Oathbreaker,1
Eh,Oathbreaker,1
Not really?,Oathbreaker,1
What's the other perks?,Oathbreaker,1
I have a zen moment/outlaw and a zen moment/dragonfly,RonInDune,1
Zen/Outlaw if it has more range would be better,Oathbreaker,1
Zen/Dragonfly is eh,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh yeah it has fantastic range: armour piercing rounds, sureshot, and range tier 5 upgrade",RonInDune,1
That's a solid roll,Oathbreaker,1
Guess I'm using that for a while then! Thanks a lot for the advice!,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, no problem! If you have any questions just let me know. I probably play too much PvP these days.",Oathbreaker,1
"yeah I'm going to pick your brain later on the grenade launcher quest, just can't seem to get that medal",RonInDune,1
For arc kills I'd suggest running arc subclass with inaugural address if you've got it,Arixama,1
"I used inaugural address for my void kills, it's like a laser that gun!",RonInDune,1
"I think its a default arc gun, so if you pull it from collections it's should be arc",Arixama,1
Ohhh I didn't realize that,RonInDune,1
Huh I have it as fire and void in my collections,RonInDune,1
"GLs aren't my specialty hahaha, with that being said I can probably still give some advice",Oathbreaker,1
Like in your vault?,Arixama,1
"Oh yeah that's what I mean, sorry",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, if you print it from your collections should be arc.",Arixama,1
Perfect,RonInDune,1
Definitely keep those fire and void ones though. Cant get them any more,Arixama,1
^^^^^,Oathbreaker,1
Oh man I wish I had made more copies of the best year 1 guns with different elements,RonInDune,1
I wish I still had my void perfect paradox,Arixama,1
"Perfect paradox got moved to primary though, did it not?",Oathbreaker,1
Yuuup,Arixama,1
Yeah that's what I figured,Oathbreaker,1
That's why I whish I still had it,Arixama,1
"on the topic of PVP and loadouts i'm gonna still gonna rep the scout rifles, they're not in a good spot at the moment but I like them",Trissin,1
jade rabbit and polaris lance are my favourites,Trissin,1
"it's dependent on the map though, some maps just wont let you run a scout",Trissin,1
"I tried the mida kinetic scout recently and thought it was ok, I think it suits people who have better aim than me",RonInDune,1
"Mida is actually pretty good, scouts are in an alright spot right now but are highly dependent on the map",Oathbreaker,1
I'd say the exotic scouts can really put some work in if used right,Oathbreaker,1
My problem with scouts (and snipers) is the flinch,RonInDune,1
I feel like the mods aren't that helpful,RonInDune,1
joining the club,Matos,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
Snipers take some time to get used to,Oathbreaker,1
Basically if you don't get first shot you need to get out of the engagement,Oathbreaker,1
Take that from someone who loves sniping,Oathbreaker,1
"alright, anybody interested in doing the corrupted ~~a few~~ like 80 times?",Trissin,1
lets do it,Arixama,1
I can't today but a big YES tomorrow onwards!,RonInDune,1
YOu better not get the curated pulse before me,RonInDune,1
hahaha dont worry with my luck it probably wont happen,Trissin,1
"i will, thats just how it works 😂",Arixama,1
"Good good, otherwise I curse you with only getting edge transit drops forever",RonInDune,1
"hmm, i think it would be most efficient to get a 200k+ score first, and then farm",Trissin,1
still pretty easy since we can easily do a +100 hanicap,Arixama,1
"yeah, we should get a third though. Anybody interested in a high score run for the corrupted nightfall? @PC",Trissin,1
"guys, just get it on your first try",Matos,1
!pve weapons,Trissin,1
Ooh did you get it?,RonInDune,1
i did!,Trissin,1
Ooof congrats,RonInDune,1
haha thank u! not curated though,Trissin,1
Severely jealous right now,RonInDune,1
SO you're wayfarer?,RonInDune,1
I don't think you need it for wayfarer actaully!,Trissin,1
you need the osprey,Trissin,1
youre thinking cursebreaker,Arixama,1
Oh sorry yeah cursebreaker,RonInDune,1
ghost and the sparrow is the roughest part of that one,Arixama,1
I don't have the ship or the ghost I think,RonInDune,1
i dont have em either,Trissin,1
theyre super rare for some reason,Trissin,1
Yeah I've done two ascendant challenges almost every week since they started and I still haven't gotten the drop,RonInDune,1
Though I haven't done the speed runs for all the challenges yet,RonInDune,1
Maybe that's why,RonInDune,1
!pve weapons,RonInDune,1
!pve weapons,Matos,1
lol,Matos,1
I have used thorn so much,Arixama,1
DO you have all the lore yet?,RonInDune,1
I still only got like5 or 6,RonInDune,1
Nope still got 2 pages left,Arixama,1
!pve weapons,Arixama,1
So @Trissin what loadout did you guys use for The Corrupted farm? And did you get the triumph for killing her using two orbs or less?,RonInDune,1
"We did get the triumph, yeah",Trissin,1
"Not on purpose though, lol",Trissin,1
"For loadouts I used 1kv and sentinal shield with ursa, ari used tractor with slowva bomb and skull",Trissin,1
Ooh I'll go with Ari's loadout,RonInDune,1
Hey anyone down to help Jokon with the thorn quest?,RonInDune,1
"hmm, is it possible to do a run of scourge or spire or something today? @PC",Trissin,1
I'm ready,RonInDune,1
I can't today,Arixama,1
maybe another time then,Trissin,1
i'm down,Matos,1
"Alright @PC , is anyone interested in doing a regular Leviathan? I have a friend who recently got into the game, just passed 300 , and I'd like to take him through",Trissin,1
i'm down,Matos,1
still need to get acrius,Matos,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
I should be home around 5ish,Arixama,1
"okay cool, that sounds good to me",Trissin,1
Plus I need normal leviathan on my new warlock anyway.,Arixama,1
"right, yeah",Trissin,1
"So, we're going to regular leviathan and then go right back into prestige, right? 😜",Arixama,1
"honestly, this group is fairly experienced so we'll see how the run goes and maybe we can actually do that lmaoo",Trissin,1
"The light on prestige is capped at 300,right?",Arixama,1
"I believe so, yeah",Trissin,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
@handley,Trissin,1
!lfg join 10,handley,1
Do we know what the challenge is this week?,Arixama,1
"no, not sure, and I can't seem to find it either",Trissin,1
I think it's dog challenge?,Trissin,1
we'll see,Trissin,1
Is the dog challege the one where you can only shoot once a phase?,RonInDune,1
I've heard that can be anoying to pull off,RonInDune,1
"that's the one, yeah.",Trissin,1
the other option is to just get 2 stacks,Trissin,1
It's very easy with 2 stacks as a warlock,Arixama,1
"^
it shouldn't be too bad yeah",Trissin,1
we could try for it,Trissin,1
"AH perfect then, my nova bombs and grenades and tractor cannons melt everything anyway",RonInDune,1
Personally I'm hoping for calus challenge,Arixama,1
"Calus challenge is cool, but it's annoying that we can't all be chilling in one well",Trissin,1
Yeah but it's the only one I don't have completed 😭,Arixama,1
:((,Trissin,1
Also scatter grenades do wonders on the dogs as a voidlock,Arixama,1
"yeah, voidwalker and tractor cannon is pretty crazy in leviathan lol",Trissin,1
"Also, I can run for gauntlet and do a prism on dogs if needed",Arixama,1
Same with me!,RonInDune,1
"sure, that's great. we'll make sure to work out the roles and stuff when we get to the encounters",Trissin,1
@RonInDune @Arixama Matos said he needs about an hour or so until he's ready and we are still missing one,Trissin,1
"Options are : we could LFG for 2 now, or we could wait for Matos to come back, see if anyone is available, and if not, LFG 1",Trissin,1
checking with my brother quick,Arixama,1
okay sure,Trissin,1
We can wait for @Matos I'm in no hurry,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/CORSAIR/status/1112455241872691207?s=19,Arixama,1
whats this,Trissin,1
its a game launcher launcher,Arixama,1
i believe its corsair's april fools,Arixama,1
lmaoooo,Trissin,1
but honestly i would love something like that,Arixama,1
if it was literally just an application that read your game library and allowed you to launch stuff from it,Arixama,1
btw any response from your brother ari?,Trissin,1
"nope, my guess is he's alseep",Arixama,1
okay lol,Trissin,1
we need 1 more for a fresh run of regular leviathan @PC !,Trissin,1
no exp. required,Trissin,1
I still need you guys' help for farming the corrupted when youre free,RonInDune,1
he just got back to me,Arixama,1
should be ready soonish,Arixama,1
"oh, sweet okay",Trissin,1
just waiting on matos then,Trissin,1
"so Matos isn't responding, what do you guys want to do @Arixama @RonInDune 
should we keep waiting or get someone else?",Trissin,1
we could also play some gambit or do EP or something while we wait,Trissin,1
im up for whatever,Arixama,1
"alright, trace and I are going to finish this story mission and then we can play gambit or something until matos is ready",Trissin,1
coolio.,Arixama,1
"whats the ep weapon this week, smg?",Arixama,1
yes,Trissin,1
you get trace whisper yet?,Arixama,1
ohh actually no he doesnt have that yet,Trissin,1
we should do that,Trissin,1
yes,Trissin,1
okay,Trissin,1
"alright, all ready to go? @RonInDune @Arixama",Trissin,1
Uhh I though we werne't starting soon so I went for inner,RonInDune,1
*dinner,RonInDune,1
oh noooooo,Trissin,1
ahhh,Trissin,1
I'm so sorry,RonInDune,1
no its okay,Trissin,1
dont worry about it,Trissin,1
Can you give me like 15 mins,RonInDune,1
I'll run back,RonInDune,1
lol okay,Trissin,1
also do we have a 6th? @Arixama,Trissin,1
yeah,Arixama,1
ALright guys I'm logging in right now,RonInDune,1
no worries,Trissin,1
Really sorry for the delay,RonInDune,1
I'm ready whenever,RonInDune,1
"yep, sorry, we just finished our crucible match",Trissin,1
trace will be back in a minute,Trissin,1
"@Matos know you just logged off, but we realized we didn't open the ventilator chest",Trissin,1
we're going to go grab it now,Trissin,1
i'm good,Matos,1
"ok np, thanks again for joining us",Trissin,1
it was fun!,Matos,1
Hey guys anyone down for a bit of nightfall grinding? I need to run the corrupted a bit for the gun...,RonInDune,1
"i just finished my lab @RonInDune , im hopping on now",Trissin,1
We have the best clan! Thanks again @Trissin and @Arixama,RonInDune,1
got my shader!,Matos,1
Oooh congrats!,RonInDune,1
gratz,Arixama,1
Where did you get it form finally?,RonInDune,1
off a pulse rifle in bergisa,Matos,1
The curated one?,RonInDune,1
Hey guys are there any tricks to get a second character to 700 fast? Or is it the same grinding as usual?,RonInDune,1
"kind of depends. but definitely put your highest weapons on, and then check your collections and print out some leveling gear until it stops increasing",Arixama,1
also with all weapons being 700 its just a higher light jump on powerfuls anyway.,Arixama,1
Should I have the 700 weapons on me or is it eough to have them in the vault?,RonInDune,1
i'd have them on you. usually i just transfer over the weapons i usually use and equip them since its what i like using anyway,Arixama,1
"That's true. I tend to use different weapons on different characters just for the feel of it, but for light levelling purposes the same guns would help",RonInDune,1
Wish I could print hunter armour as warlocks somehow lol,RonInDune,1
You should be able to? Just pull it from your collection on warlock?,Arixama,1
"Huh last I tried it didn't allow me to, lemme see again",RonInDune,1
BUt that was a just when the colelctiosn launched,RonInDune,1
That's the first Pinnacle of many,Oathbreaker,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
Niiiiice,Arixama,1
congrats!!!! thats awesome,Trissin,1
"(I forget, what are the requirements for the recluse?)",RonInDune,1
Fabled in comp and a bunch of wins,Arixama,1
"Hmm, that's almost doable. I might try for it",RonInDune,1
"If you're doing fabled anyway, you might as well also attempt for lunas",Arixama,1
"I'm around Brave II and Brave III usually, if I get any higher I tend to go on massive loss streaks",RonInDune,1
Thanks guys. Recluse is get to 2100 and just win a bunch (you'll have that finished when you get to 2100),Oathbreaker,1
"You're pretty, pretty good!",RonInDune,1
Woo!,Trissin,1
Niiice,Arixama,1
Next step: solo flawless,Trissin,1
"I think it's it's definitely doable, I had like only 4 deaths in total and that was because I was experimenting different setups for dul incaru",Trissin,1
So vorgeth didn't get you at all?,Arixama,1
believe it or not I only died at vorgeth 1 time,Trissin,1
"i used a long range pulse rifle to camp adds, and a void fusion rifle for the wizards",Trissin,1
it's really not too bad if you just sit in a corner and play extremely slowly,Trissin,1
"you have plenty of time between adds respawning, I used hunter invisibility to roam around freely without getting focused down",Trissin,1
we should do a raid this weekend,Matos,1
"spire, LW or Scourge",Matos,1
"yes we should, i would like to do that",Trissin,1
Yes!,RonInDune,1
"is there any interest in doing one tonight, possibly?",Trissin,1
I'm down,RonInDune,1
Maybe spire or scourge cause they're super short?,RonInDune,1
yep,Trissin,1
sounds good to me,Trissin,1
What's the prestige requirements this week?,RonInDune,1
"gladiator with shotgun, auto, rocket",Trissin,1
oof,RonInDune,1
I think that's actually pretty good!,Trissin,1
"shotgun and rocket are good, auto is meh",Trissin,1
I'm hearing Wardcliff off of that,Oathbreaker,1
I have no idea what Gladiator means though,RonInDune,1
gladiator is a really good buff modifier,Trissin,1
Isn't the spire boss A bit too far for wardcliff? I was thinking two tailed fox might stop the rockets,RonInDune,1
Wardcliff was the strat for a while even before the buff,Oathbreaker,1
^,Trissin,1
Ahh,RonInDune,1
Let me grab an old clip,Oathbreaker,1
your group gets an empowering rift (no well at the time) on top of the box container things near the front,Trissin,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOD4zcB0MKs,Oathbreaker,1
That was back in June,Oathbreaker,1
Now it's been buffed,Oathbreaker,1
"I can't do tonight, but I should be able to do tomorrow",Arixama,1
oh wow that melted,RonInDune,1
"yeah, gladd's team is pretty impressive lol",Trissin,1
well we're better!,RonInDune,1
"i saw a video this morning where they killed morgeth from the other side of the bridge, in last wish",Trissin,1
maybe,RonInDune,1
wat,RonInDune,1
With Mountaintop,Oathbreaker,1
how did they get him to spawn,RonInDune,1
It was beautiful,Oathbreaker,1
"I think they started in the arena and as they picked up strength they flew back across, most of them or all of them were warlocks and you can fly back across that bridge with the icarus dash tree",Oathbreaker,1
that's illegal,RonInDune,1
Bungie nerf that clan,RonInDune,1
Oh @Oathbreaker your waking vigil idea was really good! I got the arc kills in no time,RonInDune,1
Glad it worked Ron,Oathbreaker,1
"hey @Oathbreaker , by the way, how many people did you play with to get the recluse? no way it was solo right?",Trissin,1
Did a 4 stack,Oathbreaker,1
ah okay I see,Trissin,1
Was everyone as good as you?,RonInDune,1
Equal or better lol,Oathbreaker,1
@RonInDune it doens't look like we'll have enough for a raid tonight but i'm thinking we could try something like niobe if youre in,Trissin,1
I'm good but not amazing,Oathbreaker,1
Oh heck yeah I'm down for niobe,RonInDune,1
Had to be atleast an hour from now though,RonInDune,1
thats completely fine,Trissin,1
"also @Oathbreaker littlepants just got a new computer, he's thinking about making the push for luna's and etc.",Trissin,1
just thought you'd like to know,Trissin,1
"Well, I'm happy to play every now and then",Oathbreaker,1
"awesome, maybe we'll hit you up for some crucible sometime",Trissin,1
"Oh I wanted to ask, do you get the bonus for playing comp every week even if you lose?",RonInDune,1
there's a bonus for playing comp?,Trissin,1
I though you get like some points if you play 5 games or so every week? Or am I misremembering something?,RonInDune,1
Yeah 3 games,Oathbreaker,1
120 points,Oathbreaker,1
Holy cow that's more points than I expected,RonInDune,1
Wonder if I can get fabled just off of that lol,RonInDune,1
Let's see if people are free to do scourge or something today,Trissin,1
I am!,RonInDune,1
i am,Matos,1
looks like pants is free as well so that makes 4,Trissin,1
2 more for scourge today? @PC,Trissin,1
"Also if we have some people available, I'd like some help for a couple of shattered throne runs",RonInDune,1
yeah we can see! what do u need from shattered throne?,Trissin,1
"i'll be running two ST, one of the runs going for all bones",Matos,1
Oh I'll join up then,RonInDune,1
"oooh bones
i'd like to get in on that one as well",Trissin,1
I need the ship!,RonInDune,1
"right, ship. do u have the ghost?",Trissin,1
No just the sparrow,RonInDune,1
Ghost and ship are the only things left,RonInDune,1
ohh I see,Trissin,1
"that reminds me, I really need the glittering key from last wish",Trissin,1
for the raid ship,Trissin,1
Ooh for rivensbane?,RonInDune,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Yeah I'm super far from those,RonInDune,1
I need the ship and I need to do petra's,Trissin,1
Petra's damn thats a toughie,RonInDune,1
"yeah, im wondering how difficult it will be. I think if everyone plays slowly and remains patient it shouldnt be too bad",Trissin,1
Yeah the strats are safe enough that only the platforming and other random stuff can screw us,RonInDune,1
i have a glittering key and need the eggs from LW,Matos,1
"so i'm down for LW, i'd love a NoB or chattering bone",Matos,1
:o u have a glittering key???,Trissin,1
jealoussss,Trissin,1
"yea, not sure where i got it",Matos,1
it opens some chest you have to wish for,Matos,1
"yeah, theres a secret chest between morgeth and the vault that gives u the raid ship",Trissin,1
"glittering key is a rare drop at the end of the raid, kinda like 1kv",Trissin,1
i am available for scourge,Arixama,1
or whatever,Arixama,1
oh okay sweet,Trissin,1
we got any sort of time frame?,Arixama,1
If you guys need me I can be available,TheCnC,1
that would be great!,Trissin,1
What time are you guys thinking?,TheCnC,1
hmm well ron pants and I are free right now,Trissin,1
when are you and @Matos free?,Trissin,1
Give me about 20-30 minutes I can be.  Not sure about @Arixama or @Matos,TheCnC,1
im good whenever,Arixama,1
i'm free whenever,Matos,1
Ok I'll hop on here in just a few minutes then,TheCnC,1
Hopping on now,TheCnC,1
alright if everyone's good,Trissin,1
you guys are all full lol,TheCnC,1
@danny,Trissin,1
"Just got the Recluse, and Pants finally got his Luna's 😄",Trissin,1
I need to work on that...,Matos,1
I finally got all the Thorn lore pieces! Mindless grinding for the win!,RonInDune,1
congrats!!! also your triumph score is so high 😮,Trissin,1
THank you!,RonInDune,1
"I'm almost at the Chronicler seal, which is the only one that actually matters to me lol",RonInDune,1
oh my god,Trissin,1
that one is so freaking rare,Trissin,1
and like so hard to get as well,Trissin,1
Yeah it's a lot of exploring,RonInDune,1
im not even sure i've actually seen that in game before,Trissin,1
someone with chronicler title,Trissin,1
you should go for it ron,Trissin,1
The only ones I still need to get is the one where I have to steal 3 motes while invading,RonInDune,1
And the last dreaming city lore which I've been waiting for for months now,RonInDune,1
wait how many are you missing? do u know?,Trissin,1
Yeah 1 from gambit invading and stealing 3 motes.,RonInDune,1
And 1 from the dreaming city,RonInDune,1
The other is the truth to power which you get every 3 weeks from Mara,RonInDune,1
youre only 3 triumphs away from chronicler?,Trissin,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
holy crap,Trissin,1
Basically 4 lore pieces,RonInDune,1
Honestly it's a lot of looking up youtube guides,RonInDune,1
It's actually impossible to have chronicler right now I think?,Arixama,1
I think some people have glitched into getting some Truth to Power drops,RonInDune,1
"hey so I know @Matos wanted to run ST before the reset tomorrow, let me know if u need me",Trissin,1
"I believe @RonInDune and @Arixama also needed to complete it, maybe u guys can fireteam up",Trissin,1
i'll be on standby if needed,Trissin,1
I think Ari and Matos were running it last night,RonInDune,1
ohh okay,Trissin,1
But I'm super down for two runs,RonInDune,1
One warlock and one hunter,RonInDune,1
"yeah, let me know if u need me",Trissin,1
Cool maybe this evening,RonInDune,1
"I know we did a run of it, but i think Matos wanted another one on a different character?",Arixama,1
Oh okay are you guys running it this evening,RonInDune,1
I haven't made any plans for anything this evening,Arixama,1
"I'm down, i could do it on my hunter",Matos,1
Perfect,RonInDune,1
Might we potentially have enough people to do a do a couple of riven encounters later this evening?,Arixama,1
oh i do want that glittering key,Trissin,1
"perhaps, we'll have to see",Trissin,1
Is glittering key a drop off of riven?,Arixama,1
"it's the same as 1kv, it's a drop from the chest at the end of queenswalk",Trissin,1
Gotcha,Arixama,1
i'll be around,Matos,1
"yo, i might get a PC this summer. have a question about processors. was originally looking at a Ryzen 5 2600 and 1660Ti card - on a budget so that stuff worked out great. but...my MicroCenter has the Ryzen 5 1600 for 79.99 USD, and I was wondering if that's a worthwhile purchase because that price is incredible. I won't be playing many games on PC so I'm really just looking for a combo that gets good and stable fps and overall longevity.",thegoaliebear,1
@Oathbreaker i think you were the one that helped out jets last time?,Arixama,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
"Just studying for some finals, will message later",Oathbreaker,1
Okay sorry,Oathbreaker,1
Busy week,Oathbreaker,1
"I think the general feeling from PC enthusiasts is that the 2600 is better than the 1600 but not insanely so, it is a jump, but not a massive massive jump, so if you're on a tight budget go with the 1600, but otherwise it is almost always better to get the 2600.",Oathbreaker,1
@thegoaliebear ^,Arixama,1
okay sweet...i'm still at a build under $1000 with either so i'll probs end up going with the 2600 then.,thegoaliebear,1
were people still planning on shattered throne?,Arixama,1
Yup in like 30 mins,RonInDune,1
do you need a third?,Arixama,1
Maybe?,RonInDune,1
pulled stronghold,Arixama,1
Nice!,RonInDune,1
THe titan gauntlets?,RonInDune,1
Yup,Arixama,1
Is it OP?,RonInDune,1
I dunno. But it's swords,Arixama,1
Wonder if it helps face tanking reckoning tier 3 bosses,RonInDune,1
OK HOLD ON NOW,Arixama,1
are we able to still get cayde treasure maps?,Arixama,1
the maps? i dont think so,Trissin,1
it must be talking about the chests as a part of the ace quest then?,Arixama,1
"hmm, i dont think so tho",Trissin,1
im not sure,Trissin,1
Aww this is sad:,RonInDune,1
Wardcliff was too good though,Oathbreaker,1
It melted bosses beforehand,Oathbreaker,1
After the buff it was too ridiculous lmao,Oathbreaker,1
Not saying it wasn't fun,Oathbreaker,1
"it's okay, you can replace it with 1kv 😈",Trissin,1
"Yeah we kinda destroyed the spire of stars boss in seconds, felt a bit op",RonInDune,1
It was crazy fun,Oathbreaker,1
Oh 1k is easily one of my favorite exotics,Oathbreaker,1
I want Anarchy though,Oathbreaker,1
riven farm when?,Arixama,1
ill be cheesed if oath gets anarchy before me,Trissin,1
LMAO,Oathbreaker,1
"because you got 1k on like, your third run???",Trissin,1
I got 1k after 4 runs yeah,Oathbreaker,1
>.<,Trissin,1
"You were at like 60 something, right/",Oathbreaker,1
?*,Oathbreaker,1
nooo not that high,Trissin,1
twenty something,Trissin,1
26,Arixama,1
Ah okay,Oathbreaker,1
"I know a guy who got it last week, took 70 something runs",Oathbreaker,1
Someone else still doesn't have it after 80+ runs from memory,Oathbreaker,1
"im not actually sure, right, because I also had a fair amount of killing riven but not doing queenswalk",Trissin,1
for keys,Trissin,1
Where was this happening do you guys know?,RonInDune,1
No,Oathbreaker,1
But I want to,Oathbreaker,1
i'm curious as well,Trissin,1
Kinda like Swoletheon,Oathbreaker,1
I want to see it at least once,Oathbreaker,1
hahahahaha,Trissin,1
id love to see that,Trissin,1
I'm interested in the Last Word change to be honest,Oathbreaker,1
Does that mean Fan Fire is no longer infinite duration on the stacks?,Oathbreaker,1
wait they are changing last word? i thought they just added a timer,Trissin,1
"Yeah it's just a timer, but before Fan Fire stacked up to 4 times and had no duration, as long as you didn't ADS or swap weapons you had the perk indefinitely",Oathbreaker,1
What I want to know is if it now runs out,Oathbreaker,1
Ah so like memento mori on ace,RonInDune,1
Doesn't really affect me because I almost always ADS so Fan Fire is redundant but for others who hip fire that would be a harsh nerf,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah, it would be kinda rough for them if they just added a timer on the perk",Trissin,1
unfortunately i dont know since i dont use last word much,Trissin,1
Also interested in the Nova Warp stuff just because I liked the super for Warlock stuff,Oathbreaker,1
oh I heard they're bringing back hawkmoon and darkdrinker?,Trissin,1
Rumors right now,Oathbreaker,1
for penumbra,Trissin,1
huh,Trissin,1
ok,Trissin,1
itd probably make it less common in crucible and stuff,Arixama,1
"rumors based on leaks, right?",Arixama,1
"Yeah, but AnontheNine has been silent for a bit if I remember correctly",Oathbreaker,1
So who knows if it ends up being true or not,Oathbreaker,1
"Don't get me wrong, I love me some Hawkmoon, and the lucky bullet stacking made it hilariously dumb, but I don't know if it would have a place in the PvP meta",Oathbreaker,1
"Also, as an avid hand cannon user..... *SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR ONCE BUNGO PLEASE*",Oathbreaker,1
lmaoooooo,Trissin,1
Give us a cool pulse,Oathbreaker,1
Or an AR,Oathbreaker,1
I would like another exotic pulse,RonInDune,1
next up are the first curse and fatebringer,Trissin,1
Or a scout,Oathbreaker,1
^^,RonInDune,1
scout pls,Trissin,1
I don't care what it is but even as someone who loves hand cannons,Oathbreaker,1
There's like 9 of them now,Oathbreaker,1
a _lot_ of options,Trissin,1
GIVE US A GUN WE USE RIVENS HEART FOR,Arixama,1
"Sturm, Crimson, Last Word, Ace, Thorn, I feel like I'm missing out on some",Oathbreaker,1
Malfeasance,Oathbreaker,1
6 seems right but maybe not?,Oathbreaker,1
sunshot?,Trissin,1
thats energy tho,Trissin,1
Sunshot,Oathbreaker,1
Doesn't matter,Oathbreaker,1
It's a Hand Cannon,Oathbreaker,1
"_""How could you forget about me?""_",Trissin,1
It works pretty well for the hollowed lair strike,RonInDune,1
"ALso now I have to do quite a bit of gambit invading, sigh",RonInDune,1
why?,Arixama,1
i think he needs the lore,Trissin,1
I'm curious,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah ""mote thief""",RonInDune,1
I want to see what I'd need to do for Unbroken,Oathbreaker,1
unbroken,Trissin,1
damn,Trissin,1
go you!,Trissin,1
But uh... That would likely break me contrary to the title,Oathbreaker,1
LMAOO,Trissin,1
probably the same stuff i need honestly,Arixama,1
I know it's reach Legend and then reach legend x3,Oathbreaker,1
"You need like a trillion resets right, for unbroken ?",RonInDune,1
oh god not for me,Trissin,1
"I'm in class, otherwise I'd check",Oathbreaker,1
5 valor resets probably too,Arixama,1
I can easily do that when my finals finish,Oathbreaker,1
"legend, legend in multiples season, fabled in multple seasons and 5 glory ranks across all seasons are probably the difficult ones you need",Arixama,1
Not horrible tbh,Oathbreaker,1
I mean,Oathbreaker,1
Other than legend,Oathbreaker,1
getting legend is difficult isn't it...,Trissin,1
ok,Trissin,1
Legend is pretty difficult,Oathbreaker,1
i think you'll have an issue getting the third legend. other than that you have a pretty good group that you pvp with,Arixama,1
"i believe at mythic you need like what, a 3 streak to actually gain more points than a single loss?",Trissin,1
Might be two Trissin but I don't have those values just yet,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah, youre right, it's 2",Trissin,1
honestly the only reason i think youll have issues getting your third legend is cause the third season will be when school has started up for you,Arixama,1
"Yeah, that'll be the only thing",Oathbreaker,1
I won't get the seal before the rewards deadline regardless so I'm really in no hurry,Oathbreaker,1
new catalysts relased too 😮,Trissin,1
i wonder what they do,Trissin,1
Uh,Oathbreaker,1
Give me a few minutes and I can get the info I think,Oathbreaker,1
"I'm not looking in the right spots apparently, light.gg shows the catalysts but doesn't say what they do outside of stat bonuses",Oathbreaker,1
"its okay, i can check in game later",Trissin,1
ty tho,Trissin,1
I cannot wait for Finals to be over so I can finally start making progress in the run to 5500,Oathbreaker,1
lol,Trissin,1
It's like an itch I can't scratch lmao,Oathbreaker,1
"That being said when I've got time, if anyone here wants some help in getting to 2100 or just improving in general, I'm more than happy to help",Oathbreaker,1
I teamed up with Trissin and Littlepants couple of days back and it was a disaster,RonInDune,1
I think we lost 3 comp games in a row,RonInDune,1
I should probably practice a lot more,RonInDune,1
PvP practice is honestly just playing the game,Oathbreaker,1
"Go into PvE and act like any thrall is a player, practice movement, aim, that sort of thing",Oathbreaker,1
UMMMM,Arixama,1
DID YOU JUST GET THAT,Trissin,1
I JUST PULLED IT FROM A FATED ENGRAM FROM XUR?,Arixama,1

You're too late,Oathbreaker,1
the ps4 guys want me to go play crucible with it,Arixama,1
Go play Crucible with it,Oathbreaker,1
go play crucible with it,Trissin,1
im gunna wait here in xurs inventory and see if the invitation shows up,Arixama,1
I think that was patched with this update,Oathbreaker,1
"oh right, thunderlord is back",Trissin,1
Thunderlord is indeed back,Oathbreaker,1
Not that I need it,Oathbreaker,1
I want that Arbalest though,Oathbreaker,1
so it looks like xur is still here,Trissin,1
at least his model is still in the world,Trissin,1
you just cant interact with him,Trissin,1
Ah,Oathbreaker,1
I think if you refresh the instance it'll probably boot him out of there,Oathbreaker,1
Hallowed Lair is up for a Mindbender's Ambition farm,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah, i just closed the game
but someone else there also had wavesplitter",Trissin,1
Wtf???,Oathbreaker,1

sameee,Trissin,1
i dont know what else to do with all these legendary shards,Trissin,1
It's happening on Xbox as well,Oathbreaker,1
Someone had Wavesplitter drop,Oathbreaker,1
i see,Trissin,1
Interesting,Oathbreaker,1
"let's see, what do I really want though",Trissin,1
forsaken exotics,Trissin,1
"I think shards, phoenix, geomags are the big ones",Trissin,1
that i'm missing,Trissin,1
"Pheonix, Geomags, Heart of Inmost Light, and OEM for me are the 4 I want",Oathbreaker,1
I think I'm done all the Forsaken Exotic weapons,Oathbreaker,1
"Well, not Malfeasance because I don't like playing Gambit enough to finish that quest lmao",Oathbreaker,1
"i think i need a couple of things for hunter and titan, but everything else ive got",Arixama,1
I know I'm done Hunter and close for Warlock,Oathbreaker,1
Also prestige raids are Prism with Hand Cannon/Sniper Rifle/Anything,Oathbreaker,1
On the one week I can't play too much D2 because of exams the prestige raids get decent modifiers damn,Oathbreaker,1
were u planning to do some prestige raids??,Trissin,1
For the Catalysts I was thinking about it,Oathbreaker,1
"oh, telesto and sleeper?",Trissin,1
"Yeah, or Acrius, or Skyburner's",Oathbreaker,1
i think acrius and skyburner coime from prestige leviathan,Trissin,1
so the modifiers dont make a difference,Trissin,1
Ah okay,Oathbreaker,1
i think skyburners is just regular leviathan?,Arixama,1
didnt we have someone get it the other week?,Arixama,1
"oh yeah, i think youre right",Trissin,1
"""The Heavy as Iron emblem may be earned when securing 2500 kills under the effects of the Iron Burden""

Better be a cool as fuck emblem or I'm gonna care about it as much as I cared about the Wizened Rebuke - I didn't",Oathbreaker,1
i was trying to find what it looked like,Trissin,1
didnt get anything,Trissin,1
"Well, I'll see it when somebody finds out how to view it",Oathbreaker,1
I don't have a reason to go for it unless it looks cool,Oathbreaker,1
I far prefer my current emblem choices otherwise,Oathbreaker,1
!weekly,Arixama,1
lol lens of fate,Trissin,1
damnit,Arixama,1
Looking for something specific?,Oathbreaker,1
its the other mercury strike thats got the weapon,Arixama,1
DFA?,Oathbreaker,1
The Hand Cannon?,Oathbreaker,1
probably?,Arixama,1
That's the only other strike on Mercury so,Oathbreaker,1
i just kinda want all the strike weapons,Arixama,1
JUST IN CASE,Arixama,1
lool,Trissin,1
"Oooh EP has all 3 again, time to grind for those again",RonInDune,1
Bungie's gonna get ya @Arixama,RonInDune,1
"Nah, they're just gunna make some thin I'm probably not going to use anyway unusable 🤣",Arixama,1
Ah so it turns out you just won't be able use it for a few months,RonInDune,1
That's fucking stupid lmao,Oathbreaker,1
Let people use it,Oathbreaker,1
They cant,Arixama,1
I mean contract yeah,Oathbreaker,1
I just think it's a little silly but whatever,Oathbreaker,1
"They will straight up get sued by Sony, unfortunately.",Arixama,1
"Yeah, the contract is the contract, I get that",Oathbreaker,1
I'm just happy they're not un-unlocking it. It's the best they can really do in this situation,Arixama,1
"Yeah, it makes sense what they're doing just sucks that it'll take a place in your vault or inventory",Oathbreaker,1
That being said you'll have it when it unlocks so no need to chase it lmao,Oathbreaker,1
"i mean it's one slot, and it unlocked in collections",Arixama,1
"Unlocked in collections too, damn then nevermind",Oathbreaker,1
That's still pretty solid,Oathbreaker,1
@Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
https://clips.twitch.tv/MoistConsiderateTapirNerfRedBlaster,Trissin,1
not sure if you've seen this,Trissin,1

I think I saw that live,Oathbreaker,1
It's great,Oathbreaker,1
Hey can anyone help me get the double trouble dreaming city triumph?,RonInDune,1
I need two people,RonInDune,1

3 people need to stnad on 3 rock circles in front of the gate in the first are of the dreaming city,RonInDune,1
https://www.vg247.com/2018/11/02/destiny-2-forsaken-dreaming-city-secret-double-trouble-triumph-twin-chests/,RonInDune,1
that sounds easy enough,Trissin,1
Yeah it just takes too long for the area to spawn,RonInDune,1
Like 15 minutes or so,RonInDune,1
aw thats annoying,Trissin,1
The little stone circles are supposed to glow,RonInDune,1
And that doesn't happen as quick as I'd like,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
just let me know when you have a third and i can help,Matos,1
Thanks I will!,RonInDune,1
i dont mind helping out either,Trissin,1
i dont know when the rocks will be glowing though,Trissin,1
Hmm Lemme go and check right now,RonInDune,1
Also mayhem is the best mode of all time,RonInDune,1
Rift is,Oathbreaker,1
Fight me,Oathbreaker,1
Which one's rift again?,RonInDune,1
"Reverse capture the flag. Only in D1, introduced in the Taken King. Take the ""flag"" to enemy base, dunk for points",Oathbreaker,1
Oooh that sounds interesting,RonInDune,1
is that the one where u run around with the spark,Trissin,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
That's the one,Oathbreaker,1
that was a good one,Trissin,1
Honestly that sounds like a halo ish game mode,RonInDune,1
It was kinda like Oddball mixed with 1-flag CTF,Oathbreaker,1
Also I think they recently added a new EDZ triumph,RonInDune,1
oh?,Trissin,1
You have to get kills in gmabit prime and crucible using the thorn,RonInDune,1
that wasn't there before was it? Inthe veyr last page,RonInDune,1
interesting,Trissin,1
oooh it's starting,RonInDune,1
is anyone online?,RonInDune,1
Definitely wasn't there,Oathbreaker,1
come to the dremaing city if you can,RonInDune,1
"Can log in, need three minutes",Oathbreaker,1
"no worries, join up when you can",RonInDune,1
"A reminder! You can apparently get ""A Man With No Name"" lore book entries by doing gambit prime bounties.",RonInDune,1
Is that daily or weekly bounties?,Arixama,1
"Not sure, I think both",RonInDune,1
So any chance of us doing any raids this weekend?,RonInDune,1
I definitely can't. My computers a little bit fucked right now.,Arixama,1
Oh no! What's wrong there?,RonInDune,1
"Potentially a processor issue. Got a replacement on the way, and hoping that fixes it",Arixama,1
Oof that's tough. Good luck!,RonInDune,1
"I've had overheating issues with this processor in the past, so hopefully it'll be OK, since it wont have 4-5 years of use on it",Arixama,1
i'm always down,Matos,1
"If we don't have enough for a raid, we might try niobe labs again @Trissin!",RonInDune,1
oh yeah im down for that @RonInDune,Trissin,1
"although not right now, is anybody else tuning in to the LCS finals",Trissin,1
What's LCS?,RonInDune,1
LoL championships,Trissin,1
TSM had a 2-0 lead,Oathbreaker,1
I'm gonna be so sad if they throw it,Oathbreaker,1
"Went into my exam series at 0-0, came out with TSM up 2-0",Oathbreaker,1
Hope you aced your test!,RonInDune,1
RUDE liquid didn't have a great start but they're pulling it back,Trissin,1
this reverse sweep is gonna happen 😈,Trissin,1
"Nah, TSM has fucking got this in the bag",Oathbreaker,1
You hear about the SKT vs Griffin series?,Oathbreaker,1
"No, I didn't see that one",Trissin,1
What happened?,Trissin,1
SKT 3-0'd Griffin,Oathbreaker,1
ZVEN WHY,Oathbreaker,1
yaaaaaas let's go liquid,Trissin,1
"Sweet, just finished petra's run! now all i need is that glittering key",Trissin,1
Oh damn congrats!,RonInDune,1
how many runs did it take!!!,RonInDune,1
actually not many! i had a group two days ago that did 2 tries and we got to queenswalk,Trissin,1
and then today's group died twice at kalli and then we completed it!,Trissin,1
You're pretty good!,RonInDune,1
"lol, thanks ron 👍",Trissin,1
Have they increased the glittering key drop rate in this patch?,RonInDune,1
"i think so, yeah",Trissin,1
haven't gotten it yet though 😦,Trissin,1
Fingers crossed for you!,RonInDune,1
thanks!!!,Trissin,1
ALso I wish I'd get 1KV as well,RonInDune,1
I really need to do more raids,Oathbreaker,1
yeah you should  j o i n   u s,Trissin,1
School is keeping my ass busy at least until next week,Oathbreaker,1
@Oathbreaker you're a PvP god so you've transcended us mere mortals,RonInDune,1
"Lmao, trust me, there's a large number of players who would destroy me, I'm in no way a god at crucible hahaha",Oathbreaker,1
Bungie's PvP has almost always had me hooked. Destiny is no exception.,Oathbreaker,1
I mean you've absolutely shredded eveyr game I've played with you lol. But yeah I understand,RonInDune,1
Bungie's gunplay is honestly the best I've ever expreienced,RonInDune,1
"Like nothing else, right? Got me addicted to it pretty much",Oathbreaker,1
"I don't think there's any other game with guns that feel as good as, say, graviton lance, or whisper, or midnight coup, you anme it",RonInDune,1
Hey so anyone down for some comp tonight?,RonInDune,1
I'm going to get to fabled or die trying,RonInDune,1
Hopefully I'll have a running computer tonight,Arixama,1
W00t,RonInDune,1
sweet! if that's the case actually do you think it's possible to run a raid or something:?,Trissin,1
"Tentative yes. Basically I'm replacing the current processor I've been using for 5 years with the exact same model that's new, so if the processor is the problem it'll be fixed for now",Arixama,1
"okay, let us know how it goes!",Trissin,1
Whoops?,Oathbreaker,1
oh no,Trissin,1
Damn man,RonInDune,1
those poor kids,Trissin,1
Looks like my kinda game,RonInDune,1
4 or 6 stack?,Arixama,1
looks like 4 lol,Trissin,1
4,Oathbreaker,1
1 guy was AFK the entire match,Oathbreaker,1
"Anchored our spawn for the team, so we basically spawn killed them 100% of the time",Oathbreaker,1
So new processor didnt fix it and now it won't turn on at all,Arixama,1
rip,Matos,1
Huh I've never had this happen before:,RonInDune,1
Interesting,Arixama,1
"Yeah it's on mercury I let it sit there for 5 minutes, still didn't let me spawn",RonInDune,1
Interesting,Trissin,1
Protip you have to complete the curse of Osiris story to do the strikes on the map,Arixama,1
Ooof yeah I'm figuring that out the hard way now,RonInDune,1
Atleast I managed to masterwork the huckleberry from start to finish doing the adventures,RonInDune,1
Niice,Arixama,1
"Oh also, blackout makes it almost impossible to do reckoning imo",RonInDune,1
I kept getting killed even within well,RonInDune,1
finally got the ship!!!,Trissin,1
haha finallyy,Trissin,1
gat damn congrats,RonInDune,1
thanks!,Trissin,1
arbalest requires 7 revelry triumphs completed,Arixama,1
:o are they difficult?,Trissin,1
"not super difficult, just slightly grindy",Arixama,1
oh my god the verdant forest is not fun,Trissin,1
what,Arixama,1
i love it,Arixama,1
"I'm watching a stream and it seems warlock nova bomb is pretty useful, alongside tether",RonInDune,1
Though i'm still not sure how it all works,RonInDune,1
i am not enjoying this,Trissin,1
"its basically haunted forest from hallowween, but instead of getting a boss every so often, you get 5 at the end, with the amount of time based on how many braches you cleared",Arixama,1
its not based on how many branches u cleared,Trissin,1
sorry,Trissin,1
here,Trissin,1
I will show you why I did not think it was fun,Trissin,1
oh no,Arixama,1
"when we got to 100, nothing special happened, so we literally sat there and waited out the remaining 3 minutes",Trissin,1
WHY DID YOU DO THAT,Arixama,1
well this was my first run,Trissin,1
how much time did you have at the end?,Arixama,1
i was thinking like haunted forest or something,Trissin,1
like,Trissin,1
"""something MUST happen at wave 50 , otherwise there wouldnt be a triumph for it""",Trissin,1
nothing happeend,Trissin,1
"""okay, maybe 100? """,Trissin,1
still nothing,Trissin,1
so then we just kinda waited it out,Trissin,1
"our 3rd guy was clever, he left at like wave 20 or something",Trissin,1
"this other guy and I, it was our first run for both of us",Trissin,1
so we were likie,Trissin,1
what do we do?/,Trissin,1
how much time did you have for the bosses?,Arixama,1
"like, 3 minutes?",Trissin,1
but since there's so many adds it doesnt really matter,Trissin,1
"ok, so theres a limit on it, but the branches defitely have some effect on the time you get at the end.",Arixama,1
oh,Trissin,1
okay,Trissin,1
i had a run with 6 branches cleared and we only got 30 seconds,Arixama,1
oh no,Trissin,1
okay,Trissin,1
yeah that run was so long that our tincture thing ran out,Trissin,1
i had to put in more essence halfway through,Trissin,1
they should make the enemies harder the further you go or something,Trissin,1
I saw Teawrex on twitch do a 110 branch run with some level 30 randoms and they got 5 minutes for 5 bosses,RonInDune,1
Ohhh what,Trissin,1
Maybe I had 5 minutes then? I don't remember too clearly,Trissin,1
!weekly,Arixama,1
so i got the rat king catalyst,Arixama,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1
who wants to complete it for me?,Arixama,1
What do you have to do?,RonInDune,1
"you have to  kill enemies, but only pve enemy kills from fireteam members using rat king count",Arixama,1
verdant forest,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
but i gotta have someone else get the kills,Arixama,1
"yeah, i think verdant forest is a good place to do it",Trissin,1
i'm down for verdant forest stuff,Matos,1
"so i think the way it works is that for each branch you complete, you get 5 seconds for the bosses at the end",Arixama,1
!loadout,Arixama,1
Oh damn already!,RonInDune,1
it was,Arixama,1
"not that hard, honestly",Arixama,1
I thought it required like a week's worth of grinding!,RonInDune,1
nope,Arixama,1
you only need 7 of the triumph,Arixama,1
"I just got on, I could do forest as well",Thawxtem,1
Oh hey @Thawxtem ! It's been a long time!,RonInDune,1
"ya sorry, I was depressed because I thought I missed a deadline for the pins on bungie rewards but apparently they extended it",Thawxtem,1
Oh I hope you're better now. We missed you on the raids!,RonInDune,1
"not literally depressed, just majorly burnt out because with only one luck-based item left for my goal, I thought all my grinding went to waste",Thawxtem,1
What were you missing?,RonInDune,1
DC ghost shell,Thawxtem,1
Ooof,RonInDune,1
"I'm missing the ghost shell as well, plus the ship",RonInDune,1
got lucky with the ship with a random group; 1st boss in the dungeon,Thawxtem,1
"btw, I haven't played at all this season. Where did Drifter go? he's not in his usual hideout that im used to",Thawxtem,1
"Annex, should be a blue flag",Arixama,1
...mote bank looks creepy outside gambit,Thawxtem,1
"thawxtem! welcome back, it's been so long!",Trissin,1
"hope youre doing better now, we've missed you",Trissin,1
"thanks! I think the break was actually good for me. bummed I missed suff, but the forest is a great way to get the hang of fighting again",Thawxtem,1
@Arixama how is arbalest??,Trissin,1
havent tried it yet,Arixama,1
4 shots to pop a shield with matchgame on,Arixama,1
that's pretty good!,Trissin,1
actually i dont know the ammo economy of the gun but it seems pretty good to me,Trissin,1
"17 ammo, 5 magazine",Arixama,1
special ammo,Arixama,1
hmm I think that's alright,Trissin,1
how good is the raw damage?,Trissin,1
"maybe like, 3/4 of a sniper shot i am guessing?",Trissin,1
was doing like 40000 some on a crit in dc on a red bar,Arixama,1
😮 it one shots with precision shot in crucible,Trissin,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/be1fcv/all_you_need_to_know_about_the_arbalest/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,Arixama,1
i see,Trissin,1
"so basically you can take a crooked fang as your special, but you give up your exotic slot",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
You can basically run crooked fang ep shotty and thunderlord,Arixama,1
wait what,Trissin,1
It goes in the kinetic slot,Arixama,1
but thunderlord is exotic,Trissin,1
YUP I'M DUMB,Arixama,1
*hammerhead,Arixama,1
hahaha yeah,Trissin,1
"ammo economy would be kind of a pain though, with 2 specials",Trissin,1
"at that point I would question why threat level, borealis, and hammerhead wouldnt be better",Trissin,1
i am getting the first parts of my PC next week!!,thegoaliebear,1
I know I'm the last to do this but last week I finally got my two main chars to 700!,RonInDune,1
I only have 1 character at 700😂,Arixama,1
"Grinding is a wee bit boring, though I did tke your advice!",RonInDune,1
Wish I had more story content to grind for power though,RonInDune,1
Something else you can do is buy the exotics from xur on your max level character for other class and that's a decent boost as well,Arixama,1
"Oh yeah that helped so much, especially with the timely gwisin vest sell!",RonInDune,1
Let's see if we have people interested in raiding over the weekend,Trissin,1
I am!,RonInDune,1
"I should be able to. Can't do tonight, but could probably do tomorrow",Arixama,1
That's number 2.,Oathbreaker,1
Mountaintop and NF next.,Oathbreaker,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
Lots of people farming for mountaintop last week during mayhem,RonInDune,1
Did you play comp today?,Arixama,1
Pretty much all day,Oathbreaker,1
Same for yesterday too,Oathbreaker,1
How awful was it?,Arixama,1
I mean I didn't think it was horrible? I'm sitting at about 2700,Oathbreaker,1
The worst part is the nade spam,Oathbreaker,1
Oof,RonInDune,1
With suppressor and skip nades it basically becomes a game of who has more of them,Oathbreaker,1
I still need 4 more resets and 8 more comp games for redrix,RonInDune,1
Might just wait out this week maybe,RonInDune,1
I'd go for it honestly,Oathbreaker,1
Embrace the spam,Oathbreaker,1
"When you don't really care for if you're getting specific kills (solar or hand cannon headshots), its somewhat entertaining",Oathbreaker,1
"I don't have a high level titan, so what's a warlock/hunter strat?",RonInDune,1
!pvp,RonInDune,1
Warlock would be arcbolt nades on top tree storm for the arc web,Oathbreaker,1
Hunter is shinobus vow with skip nades,Oathbreaker,1
Alright I'll try those tonight and report back!,RonInDune,1
Alternate warlock strat is contraverse holds or nezarac's sin and middle tree nova for the handheld supernova,Oathbreaker,1
Ohh yeah contraverse I forgot about that,RonInDune,1
I'd argue that the Handheld is the far better idea because of the insane 1-shot range,Oathbreaker,1
Oh yeah handheld was my jam for a while until nova warp got nerfed,RonInDune,1
Also oath you have 3 resets already this season?!!‽? Dang dude,RonInDune,1
.......I play too much PvP.,Oathbreaker,1
"Haha I understand, it's fun!",RonInDune,1
!pvp,Oathbreaker,1
You have a 26 game winning spree! That's incredible!,RonInDune,1
That was me just messing around with some friends,Oathbreaker,1
"Also how do you get 40 kills in a match lol, the other team had a real bad day",RonInDune,1
If I remember correctly we were playing control like it was clash (not capping any flags) and just slaying out,Oathbreaker,1
Uh,Oathbreaker,1
1: Luck,Oathbreaker,1
2: Aim was especially good that day,Oathbreaker,1
Bloody heck,RonInDune,1
Also anytime I see someone someone bring a sniper into crucible I know they mean business,RonInDune,1
"Eh, not every sniper is that great",Oathbreaker,1
Occasional good shots but everyone can hit them,Oathbreaker,1
I mean my greatest sniper strat was when I killed 3 people using whisper in rumble,RonInDune,1
"When you see a few hundred kills on a snipe, be a little afraid. When you see over 1k, be afraid. When you see anything more than 3k, be very fucking scared",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah that just sounds spooky,RonInDune,1
I just pulled oem,Arixama,1
You're a crucible god now,Oathbreaker,1
Go get a We Ran,Oathbreaker,1
With a very good roll for you Oath,Arixama,1
YOu're not allowed to play crucible anymore,RonInDune,1
OH FOR FUCKS SAKES,Oathbreaker,1
SR reserves and Remote connection,Arixama,1
WHY,Oathbreaker,1
WHY DO I STILL NOT HAVE ONE,Oathbreaker,1
AND WHY DOES EVERYONE HAVE A SNIPER ROLL,Oathbreaker,1
"I got hc and SR targeting, remote connection SR reserves and sword reserves",Arixama,1
I'm gonna go scream into something while I continue to not get OEM.,Oathbreaker,1
I pulled mine from xur,Arixama,1
Right,Oathbreaker,1
Tentacle face,Oathbreaker,1
Does forsaken stuff in the fated engrams now,Arixama,1
yup,Matos,1
"Finally got the arbalest, it's a fun gun!",RonInDune,1
"Man, had a pretty busy day today",Trissin,1
I know it's late but is anyone interested in doing scourge tonight?,Trissin,1
Yes!,RonInDune,1
Any and all raids honestly,RonInDune,1
I could hop on if we get the people,Arixama,1
unfortunately it doesnt look like we do,Trissin,1
pants is busy tonight,Trissin,1
"oh wait actually, pants might be free soon",Trissin,1
Do we have two more?,RonInDune,1
Maybe @Jokon or @Matos ?,RonInDune,1
"last two weeks, haven;'t won a single gambit match due to pugs",Matos,1
don't know if i can keep this up,Matos,1
What!,RonInDune,1
Damn,RonInDune,1
"Yup, people still don't know what to do. don't feel like logging in anymore to keep banging my head against a wall",Matos,1
Gambit or prime?,Arixama,1
"mostly prime, with some regular gambit in there",Matos,1
any raids before reset?,Matos,1
"Unfortunately I'm busy getting settled into a new apartment, but I can try to get on if we have the people",Trissin,1
We can try Niobe labs again if we don't have enough people for the full raid,RonInDune,1
Hey guys is it double valor this week?,RonInDune,1
Yup,Arixama,1
Perfect time to grind for redrix then! Will it triple on the weekends like last time?,RonInDune,1
I would guess so. It has almost every other iron banner,Arixama,1
good luck dealing with the grenade spamming,Thawxtem,1
Oh yeah I forgot about that,RonInDune,1
Sigh,RonInDune,1
Atleast it'll make my solo shattered throne attempts slightly more bearable,RonInDune,1
"Well yeah, but on triple Valor a loss is the same as a win normally",Arixama,1
but any quests that lose progress in the crucible can easily skyrocket downward. VERY quickly,Thawxtem,1
Is it a full curse week?,Matos,1
yep,Thawxtem,1
Those are definitely a lost cause this week. Just run a character that doesn't have it,Arixama,1
"Hey FYI with avengers being out some places, it might be a good idea to opt out of *at least* local chat for the time being",Arixama,1
If you want to avoid spoliers,Arixama,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
we have a strict ban on spoilers for the movie so you don't have anything to worry about. if we see anything being posted we'll make sure to take it down. but if you want to be extra safe at least until you see the movie...you can always mute everything else haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I got spoiled to heck and beyond by reddit's 4chan sub so be careful about those as well,RonInDune,1
oof...sorry to hear :( I've been on a social media cleanse all week so far until sunday when i see it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I was slightly careful but they were on the reddit front page and had massive spoiler filled flairs. Pricks.,RonInDune,1
yeah that sucks. honestly can't believe this really is the end of an era tho 😩😭 lol,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I was mostly talking about the ingame chat we have on PC cause I know some people here have their settings set to auto opt in,Arixama,1
sure thing. just covering all the bases aha. gonna post with the xbox side too.,thegoaliebear,1
Hey so anyone down for grinding some shattered throne this week?,RonInDune,1
I finally have 3 characters maxed out and I'd really *really* like the ship now lol,RonInDune,1
you ready now?,Thawxtem,1
Oh yeah I can log in now give me a minute,RonInDune,1
Luna's and NF being nerfed/changed,Oathbreaker,1
!!!!,RonInDune,1
Newest TWAB is out,Oathbreaker,1
"whoa, what?",Matos,1
That's illegal,RonInDune,1
http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47793,Oathbreaker,1
Being changed to a 150rpm archetype and Mag Howl only activates on bodyshot,Oathbreaker,1
Hmm I'm not sure how much of a nerf that is but it's cool that they're listening to players,RonInDune,1
"Also they confirmed triple valour starting tomorrow, so maybe I can get a couple of resets out of it",RonInDune,1
It's a nerf alright,Oathbreaker,1
Going from a 0.67s TTK to a 0.80s TTK nerfs them hard,Oathbreaker,1
"Besides, the 150 archetype 3 taps to the head, this only allows for a 2head/1body kill",Oathbreaker,1
So that's one more bodyshot,RonInDune,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
Atleast they didn't hit the range,RonInDune,1
If they hit the range there wouldn't be a reason to use Lunas,Oathbreaker,1
It barely outranges TLW right now,Oathbreaker,1
I very rarely see NFs so this is probably hitting only the best players,RonInDune,1
Whoa really? I only use TLW against close range shotgunners,RonInDune,1
For range Ace seems pretty good,RonInDune,1
"Really, all this might do is push more players to Ace",Oathbreaker,1
Ace is defacto the best hand cannon in the game,Oathbreaker,1
Does Ace outrange Lunas/NF,RonInDune,1
"About the same as NF, maybe a little more",Oathbreaker,1
Oh wow,RonInDune,1
Ace also has High Cal which flinches people hard,Oathbreaker,1
And has Memento Mori,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah the Ace flinch makes snipers/scouts veyr hard to use,RonInDune,1
Does memento mori work with the warlock reload boots?,RonInDune,1
I think so,Oathbreaker,1
nice,RonInDune,1
"Ace is probably one the best guns in the game period, both in PvE and PvP",RonInDune,1
"Basically, what this is doing is making the Magnificent Howl perk much less worth it",Oathbreaker,1
I was gonna grind for NF but now I'm hesitant I think,Oathbreaker,1
Just doesn't seem worth it when I can use other guns that will have more power over it,Oathbreaker,1
Do you just need to get to legend?,RonInDune,1
5500 and get 300 Lunas kills,Oathbreaker,1
It's a bragging right more than anything I feel like. Best proof that you're amazing at the game!,RonInDune,1
I mean not really,Oathbreaker,1
People are cheesing their way to it,Oathbreaker,1
Cheesing all the way to legend?,RonInDune,1
"Win-trading, getting 300 kills in a few games",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
Damn,RonInDune,1
"Using VPNs along with some other connection tricks to match the same team over and over again, and you just win trade to get it",Oathbreaker,1
I know you said people can do that till fabled but till legend is something else,RonInDune,1
I see lots of people on twitch saying lunas/NF carry,RonInDune,1
"There's an entire set of discord servers for it, along with a channel on the massive LFG discord just for that reason",Oathbreaker,1
Funnily enough I saw one saying Trials flawless carry,RonInDune,1
Man Bungie should really shut that down,RonInDune,1
Are there aimbots and stuff too?,RonInDune,1
Like in CS,RonInDune,1
There's one guy for sure,Oathbreaker,1
oof,RonInDune,1
"He's been known for a while though, dunno why Bungie hasn't done something, that or he's just got a great gaming chair",Oathbreaker,1
The thing for me is that changing the archetype to a 150 means that you can trade a kill with someone using a 150,Oathbreaker,1
"Sure, you can 2h/1b them but if they're good they can still 3h you at the same speed, which is a trade",Oathbreaker,1
I know sunshot and midnight coup are 150 but I've *never* tried them in PvP,RonInDune,1
They're not the best,Oathbreaker,1
150s are in a weird spot,Oathbreaker,1
"Sunshot has bad recoil and no ammo, Midnight Coup is a PvE hand cannon, doesn't have the range for PvP, Jack Queen King 3 isn't a random roll and has an *okay* perk set, Waking Vigil is hard to get a good roll, and any other 150s are just forgotten in my mind",Oathbreaker,1
Okay,Oathbreaker,1
I know only a quarter of those,RonInDune,1
"Well, most of those cannot be random rolled and only three I think are considered viable in PvP",Oathbreaker,1
"JQK3, Dire Promise, and Waking Vigil",Oathbreaker,1
Dang,RonInDune,1
Wonder if they'll play around with the nerfs then,RonInDune,1
It's Bungie,Oathbreaker,1
I have less faith with each passing day,Oathbreaker,1
Maybe keep it at 180 and shift range or handling or something,RonInDune,1
Have they added any map since forsaken?,RonInDune,1
The maps are pretty and all but it gets boring fast,RonInDune,1
Only like one,Oathbreaker,1
I wish they'd have some more in the leviathan,RonInDune,1
What are the best handcannon maps?,RonInDune,1
All of them,Oathbreaker,1
Hand cannons are viable on just about every map with maybe the exception of Equinox and Vostok,Oathbreaker,1
But even then you can play ranges well and still be successful with them,Oathbreaker,1
"hey all, sorry for going dark lately, still busy setting up the new apartment",Trissin,1
there's no internet here yet :((,Trissin,1
Oh no!!!,RonInDune,1
"any raids this weekend? i need the eggs from LW, almost done eggs/bones",Matos,1
I think you can get all eggs but one from Last Wish by inputting the codes,RonInDune,1
"Also, I'm down for a raid!",RonInDune,1
The only one you can't get with  the codes is the one between the ogre and vault,Arixama,1
You would still need someone to start it from the beginning each time to make the wishes for the eggs and the jumps; easier just to do in 1 raid in my opinion,Thawxtem,1
Does last wish not have the reset button on it?,Arixama,1
Finally finished all the iron banner bounties,RonInDune,1
Got a reset and a half with it,RonInDune,1
Holy hell guys,RonInDune,1
Xur just gave me one eyed mask,RonInDune,1
"Whoa, did you join Team Titan?",Matos,1
Levelling up my  titan,RonInDune,1
it is complete!,thegoaliebear,1
I'll be making the switch 100% to PC when D3 comes out...still got another year of D2 left on my console life😩,thegoaliebear,1
"You *could* make the switch now. They've got the power surge bounties, so it won't be as hard to catch up",Arixama,1
haha yeahhhh but i also have one more year of college...and i low key don't want to bring it there especially since I'm away from my apt a lot for games.,thegoaliebear,1
I've also come too far with my characters on console. gotta finish up the era hahaha,thegoaliebear,1
Hey guys I really need to do a couple of shattered throne runs,RonInDune,1
Anyone down tonight or tomorrow?,RonInDune,1
yea i tried solo-ing it with the tonic and shield spam,Matos,1
"still annoying, so i'm down to run two runs tomorrow",Matos,1
Alright perfect!,RonInDune,1
Yeah soloing is still an ordeal damn,RonInDune,1
"if i didn't play a titan, it would be much easier",Matos,1
But the infinite shield throw today in reckoning feels so good!!!,RonInDune,1
I had no idea what I was missing!,RonInDune,1
"I'm not 700 yet on titan though, sigh",RonInDune,1
Finally have *Cursebreaker*!,RonInDune,1
Thanks @Thawxtem !,RonInDune,1
Did you do your STs?,Matos,1
Yeah one hunter run,RonInDune,1
I still want to do it once more on my titan anyway,RonInDune,1
"Ron, congrats!!!! 👌",Trissin,1
Sorry I didn't see this sooner,Trissin,1
I should be getting internet installed tomorrow,Trissin,1
Can't wait to get back online haha,Trissin,1
Thanks!,RonInDune,1
Honestly the revelry made it so much easier!,RonInDune,1
Trying to solo ST on my titan right now,RonInDune,1
You got this!!,Trissin,1
finally got internet back 🙏,Trissin,1
i feel so free,Trissin,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1
I can watch netflix and youtube and play video games again haha,Trissin,1
Welcome to the modern world!,RonInDune,1
"thank you, thank you, it truly is incredible",Trissin,1
"Alright so I'm still kinda new to Titan, but what's the loadout to do massive boss DPS? Something equivalent to blade barrage/nighthawk golden gun or nova bomb/chaos reach?",RonInDune,1
Cause it's taking me way too long to kill high HP targets and shield throw spam is not the most reliable,RonInDune,1
Oh to do boss damage I usually use melting point and then full auto shotgun,Trissin,1
or thunder Lord or 1k or something else,Trissin,1
I'm not too sure for sentinel,Trissin,1
but I don't think sentinel has good single target dps,Trissin,1
"Ron, Titan has nothing equivalent to Blade barrage/slowva/chaos reach.",Matos,1
That’s part of the issue right now. Titans strength is in pvp and add clear.,Matos,1
That's kinda bad,RonInDune,1
(understatement),RonInDune,1
Ok which one was melting point again? hammer Strike?,RonInDune,1
Top tree sun breaker.,Matos,1
"Perfect, thanks! I quite like using Hallowfire heart and the sunspots for essentially infinite abilities",RonInDune,1
That’s the siege build. Viable in add clear.,Matos,1
"I want the khepri's horn exotic, apparently you can kill just using the barricade!",RonInDune,1
it looks cool thats for sure,Matos,1
Finally got my Titan to 700!,RonInDune,1
"For the first time, I have all chars to max power.",RonInDune,1
Honestly the grinding was way less annoying than I had feared,RonInDune,1
😮 nice!!!,Trissin,1
So do you guys want to try Niobe labs this weekend again?,RonInDune,1
"Sure, I'm down",Trissin,1
We got so far last time!,RonInDune,1
(♪and tried so hard♫),RonInDune,1
Petra's Run done! Need the sparrow and a couple other challenges for Rivensbane,Oathbreaker,1
Congrats!!! You're almost there!,Trissin,1
praying rng is kind to you with the sparrow lol 🙏🙏🙏,thegoaliebear,1
I regret not doing any shattered throne runs last week cause all I need is the ship,Arixama,1
"I ran it so many times, finally got it on my hunter, thanks to @Thawxtem essentially soloing Dul Incaru",RonInDune,1
There's a 20% chance of drop every major encounter I think,RonInDune,1
"Ari, I’m in the same boat. My Destiny motivation is at an all time low.",Matos,1
"Depending if people are free, maybe we can get a raid going this weekend?",Trissin,1
Oh yeah for sure!,RonInDune,1
I could join a raid team for tonight or Sunday,Thawxtem,1
Anyone else interested in raiding tonight? @PC,Trissin,1
"Sure, what time though?",RonInDune,1
Depends when people are free! maybe around 8 CT?,Trissin,1
That sounds about ok with me,RonInDune,1
Maybe push it another 30 ~ 45 mins if possible,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, sure",Trissin,1
Let's see if we have enough people first,Trissin,1
im definitely up for an attempt,Arixama,1
What raid?,Matos,1
I'm down for Scourge or Last Wish,RonInDune,1
Can maybe join,Oathbreaker,1
Sounds like we have 6 then right!,RonInDune,1
I can do whatever a little later.,TheCnC,1
Assuming anybody else winds up not being able to make it.,TheCnC,1
"okay, sweet",Trissin,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
Just let me know. I'll be home within 15 minutes of 8pm,TheCnC,1
"I'll be a backup if you need one, feeling kinda tired tonight so might be getting some sleep early",Oathbreaker,1
"Ofc, no pressure at all, go get some rest!",Trissin,1
I wonder if @Matos and @Thawxtem are free ?,Trissin,1
"yea I'm free, you guys forming?",Matos,1
Getting on,Thawxtem,1
"awesome, will you join us @TheCnC ?",Trissin,1
he needs like 15ish minutes,Arixama,1
Might take that long for me to get ready anyway,Thawxtem,1
Driving home as we speak.,TheCnC,1
joining Raid VC,Thawxtem,1
I am here and in game!,TheCnC,1
ALright I'll be online in like 5 mins,RonInDune,1
@Oathbreaker My PC has DERPED very hard and it's currently scanning and repairing.  They are on the last gauntlet if you wanted to still go help them.  It may take me a few minutes for the game to repair.,TheCnC,1
It hated that I was running the right way I guess.,TheCnC,1
"Yeah, I can sub in",Oathbreaker,1
Give me a moment guys,Oathbreaker,1
My bar is only 50% full atm.  I can come back in once it's done if you would prefer to have me replace you when it's done.,TheCnC,1
"Sounds good, when it gets close to completion just let me know and we can swap out",Oathbreaker,1
Ok it just finished,TheCnC,1
Sorry,TheCnC,1
Let me just make sure it boots properly lol,TheCnC,1
"Hahaha, all good",Oathbreaker,1
Ok it seems ok,TheCnC,1
Sorry to bother you lol,TheCnC,1
Hopefully it holds for you guys,Oathbreaker,1
No problems lmao,Oathbreaker,1
Guys this would be a great weekend to do Niobe labs with the revelry buff,RonInDune,1
"Oh yeah, true",Trissin,1
We don't have a third though,Trissin,1
Maybe someone here wants to join in?,RonInDune,1
Niobe labs does not seem very fun.,Matos,1
Just quickly looked it up.,Matos,1
Yeah but think of the bragging rights!!1!,RonInDune,1
What time were you guys thinking?,Oathbreaker,1
"I'm free for the evening, more or  less",RonInDune,1
What is Niobe labs anyway? I still haven’t run into it,Thawxtem,1
"It was an activity intended to open up the Bergusia Forge during the Black Armory DLC, unfortunately Bungie made it a little hard for the community to solve and it actually took longer than most raids did to solve",Oathbreaker,1
So Bungie opened up the Forge early instead of making the community wait,Oathbreaker,1
Some of the puzzles were way too convoluted,RonInDune,1
Understatement of the year,Oathbreaker,1
"Guys if you have any reveler's essence remaining , remember to turn them in for eva's gifts!",RonInDune,1
I got around 25-ish masterwork cores from doing that,RonInDune,1
"Oh shit, yeah I have about 600...",Oathbreaker,1
Should probably do that,Oathbreaker,1
New exotic quest! Yay!,RonInDune,1
wait what???,Trissin,1
😮,Trissin,1
HOLY CRAPPPP,Trissin,1
NO WAY!!!!,Trissin,1
THAT'S CRAZYYY,Trissin,1
"An amazing new exotic pulse, won't spoil",RonInDune,1
just googled it,Trissin,1
omg,Trissin,1
I'm starting this right now!!!!,RonInDune,1
is it hard to get ????,Trissin,1
Nah but apparently the last mission is 690 and hard!,RonInDune,1
Probably should fireteam up if possible,RonInDune,1
"yeah, lets do it together",Trissin,1
I'm about to start the quest as soon as I get in,RonInDune,1
i want to do this like NOW,Trissin,1

Yup yyup,RonInDune,1

Is the first step solo?,RonInDune,1

"in middle of Heroic, just got beginning item",Thawxtem,1
Alright we'll be in the farm,RonInDune,1
final boss,Thawxtem,1
It's gonna take all my willpower not to get distracted and check the internet for solutions,Trissin,1
Never!,RonInDune,1
"so I watched some PvP gameplay of the gun, it looks strong",Trissin,1
"most importantly, it MAKES THE SOUND",Trissin,1
the perk from d1,Trissin,1
On uhhh,Trissin,1
Ex machina sniper,Trissin,1
"""wait for it"" perk",Trissin,1
That sound is soooo goood,Trissin,1
Like all those wotm weapon perk sounds,Trissin,1
SO did you guys get it?,RonInDune,1
I'm ready again whenever,RonInDune,1
We didn't,Thawxtem,1

||Alright so apparently to get the time trial emblem you have to complete it with at least 5 minutes on the clock. People are saying there is a pretty easy chees to do it though:  https://redd.it/blzmm3||,RonInDune,1
we can do it!,Trissin,1
"I am super ready to do the heroic catalyst as well, did you get it?",RonInDune,1
"got the gun, haven't attempted heroic yet",Trissin,1
oh it feels SO GOOD,Trissin,1
just like d1,Trissin,1
It has like NO RECOIL,RonInDune,1
Absolutely shreds majors,RonInDune,1
"performance? yeah it's good.
more importantly the S O U N D",Trissin,1
the wrath of the machine weapon sound that i've missed so much,Trissin,1
"Haha I'm glad you like it, the game needed a cool mystery!",RonInDune,1
it did,Trissin,1
but honestly im just really happy with the way it feels to use,Trissin,1
and i really just cannot get over the little sound effect,Trissin,1
_brrrrt dvvvt_,Trissin,1
||Oh and there is a ship quest by the way||,RonInDune,1
w h a t,Trissin,1
"Yeah it's such a cool gun, probably the best sounding one after the graviton lance",RonInDune,1
||https://clips.twitch.tv/DiligentHyperRadicchioTF2John||,RonInDune,1
graviton lance ew,Trissin,1
whoaaaa,Trissin,1
oh my god there's still so much to discover,Trissin,1
||here's a thread with the links: https://twitter.com/AyyItsChevy/status/1125894970324529158||,RonInDune,1
do I dare to click that?,Trissin,1
Sure don't open it unless you're ready though,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
Guys go talk to the drifter if you've completed the ||zero hours exotic quest||,RonInDune,1
Hey @Trissin do you want to try for the catalyst tonight?,RonInDune,1
"oh actually i just finished the heroic version! but im happy to run others thru it, absolutely",Trissin,1
Oh yeah I'm down around a few hours from now,RonInDune,1
I'm definitely down if you need a third,Arixama,1
Perfect!,RonInDune,1
I’ll be around to do a heroic run. Still need to watch a video in the route though.,Matos,1
Oh oops sorry!,RonInDune,1
"||I think that the keycards have been found, and I think I saw a post on reddit of someone who opened the vaults for 7 rooms, each with 7 siva particulate, but I am not sure||",Trissin,1
"||Ooh cool, can't wait to atleast get the catalyst soon||",RonInDune,1
hey @Oathbreaker have you had a chance for it yet?,Trissin,1
Not yet,Oathbreaker,1
Holy cow guys I had the best gambit game of my life,RonInDune,1
And I finally got Dredgen,RonInDune,1
I will never play gambit in my life ever again,RonInDune,1
😮 congrats!!!!!,Trissin,1
thats awesome,Trissin,1
Thank you!,RonInDune,1
Hey so anyone wants to do the heroic version?,RonInDune,1
Are we trying the exotic catalyst again tonight?,RonInDune,1
I'm fixing to go gambit prime if you care to join,Thawxtem,1
"Sure I'll log in, giv eme 5 mins",RonInDune,1
I've got 36 minutes to complete a match for a bounty,Thawxtem,1
"was just doing a heroic in a pug, got halfway through and servers went down",Matos,1
well at least i know the heroic path,Matos,1
We can do it this evening then!,RonInDune,1
After they've fixed the other quest as well,RonInDune,1
I’ll be around for a heroic run and to do the void puzzle.,Matos,1
Heck yeah!,RonInDune,1
We need one more!,RonInDune,1
Need to do normal first,Oathbreaker,1
Otherwise I'd be game,Oathbreaker,1
"I can do normal a couple of times for sure, trying to get the time trial",RonInDune,1
It'll be super fast,RonInDune,1
(Also doing it blind the first time with trissin and ari was amazing!),RonInDune,1
"I finish classes at 11 CT, not sure if you guys will still be on but  I will be free to help out then",Trissin,1
I'll probably be on then sure,RonInDune,1
🙌,Trissin,1
I think i'm going to try and complete it within the first 24 hours this time,Trissin,1
hopefully earn a cool emblem,Trissin,1
Lw and sotp are locked until worlds first,Arixama,1
"yes, I saw",Trissin,1
i'm ready to grind out 3 characters,Trissin,1
"get as high as I can, and then see if I can complete it on day 1",Trissin,1
I *should* have that day off,Arixama,1
"i'm kind of upset its not friday though, that works way better for me...",Trissin,1
Would love to attempt it but I'm in Scotland till the 8th,Oathbreaker,1
"For the first week, there's usually a jacket reward, isn't there?",Arixama,1
"Till reset, yeah",Oathbreaker,1
Heck yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
"also, i want to do the ||void configuration|| tonight, if people will join me",Trissin,1
Yes for sure,RonInDune,1
If you guys want to help me do the normal version I will probably be available for the heroic and configuration but if someone else wants in they can have priority,Oathbreaker,1
We can do one normal for @Thawxtem and  @Oathbreaker as well I think,RonInDune,1
Oh yeah I can run normal on my hunter as well maybe with @Oathbreaker,RonInDune,1
"It won't unlock the heroic on your hunter, it's bugged right now",Arixama,1
But can I do the normal?,RonInDune,1
"You can, but it won't drop the gun or unlock heroic, just so you're aware",Arixama,1
"I'd prefer doing the heroic on my warlock for sure, platforming is so much easier if I can just float above for so long",RonInDune,1
Oh not even the gun?,RonInDune,1
Dang,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, that's the bug. It doesn't drop on secondary characters right now",Arixama,1
Huh,RonInDune,1
Anyway I'm down for all the versions wheneve rpeople are ready,RonInDune,1
cool. ill be home in like 4.5 hours lol,Trissin,1
"Ok the gun does insane damage, you can literally one phase insurrection prime if you stack buffs correctly",RonInDune,1
Oh I saw that this morning lol,Trissin,1
"I need to do some Reckoning, and then I was hoping to do a quick SOTP before trying the quest for the weapon. Anyone willing to be a reliable team for one or both?",Thawxtem,1
When were u thinking?,Trissin,1
"I'm getting on now, Reckoning is whenever I get a team together, and SOTP is similar, though I'm willing to set more of a time on the raid",Thawxtem,1
I just chose it over LW because it's faster,Thawxtem,1
Farming for power,Thawxtem,1
I'll be free at ~11:30 ct,Trissin,1
"Just @ me when you guys are gonna do a normal run, I won't be up too late but I can spare some time",Oathbreaker,1
@Thawxtem You are high enough for an easy normal run right now I think,RonInDune,1
god these gambit games,Matos,1
Oh no what happened,RonInDune,1
"just can't do it, highest primeval damage, most motes deposited, most enemies killed and i have paste eaters on my team",Matos,1
Ooof,RonInDune,1
5 rounds today all losses,Matos,1
just getting tired of this shit,Matos,1
and the rng behind unlocking titles,Matos,1
"I feel bad for you, maybe LFG teams?",RonInDune,1
Yeah the RNG is really bad,RonInDune,1
What's missing for yo?,RonInDune,1
third reset and protect the runner,Matos,1
"Reset should be easier this week, just stock up on bounties for the grind to legend",RonInDune,1
But protect the runner is impossible without a fireteam,RonInDune,1
"@Matos I was thinking about doing some Gambit, care for a team member?",Thawxtem,1
hopped off for now,Matos,1
i'll be on tomorrow and all weekend,Matos,1
* YEAH! Got powered up Black Talon sword from Ascendant Challenge!!,Thawxtem,1
Nice!,RonInDune,1
"THat's a excellent weapon, devastating in PvP",RonInDune,1
"btw, I'm 690 now. If we could find a 3rd, would you try the quest again tonight?",Thawxtem,1
"Sure, if oath or trissin wants to",RonInDune,1
Around 30 ish mins from now,RonInDune,1
(for me),RonInDune,1
Alright,Thawxtem,1
Getting a little late for me unfortunately,Oathbreaker,1
i just got home,Trissin,1

let me know when you guys are good to go,Trissin,1
Alright I'm logigng in now,RonInDune,1
We can do one normal for @Thawxtem and then the heroic and then the secret,RonInDune,1
finally got the catalyst after many pugs,Matos,1
now just the void configuration puzzle,Matos,1
Oh wow congrats!,RonInDune,1
i'll wait for you guys to do that,Matos,1
"I still haven't gotten mine, looking to do that and the void quest tonight",RonInDune,1
"^
need to do void config",Trissin,1
you going to be online tonight Trissin?,Matos,1
"Yep, yeah",Trissin,1
I'll be on soon,Trissin,1
Do you have time to run one heroic before doing the void puzzle?,RonInDune,1
"sure, np",Trissin,1
Cool I'm down then!,RonInDune,1
Hopefully I won't spend 15 minutes on the jump puzzle again,RonInDune,1
alright ill be on in a couple mins @Matos @RonInDune,Trissin,1
Alright i'm just finishg up this week's xur mission,RonInDune,1
You guys willing to run heroic with me afterwards?,Thawxtem,1

i'll be around tomorrow for void configuration,Matos,1
I looked it up and it looks confusing.,Matos,1
"dont worry, it's not actually that hard.",Trissin,1
"for us at least, all the hard work has been done by the r/raidsecrets community",Trissin,1
to actually solve the puzzle and stuff,Trissin,1
we just read their guides lol,Trissin,1
Yeah we did it first time and it felt super simple,RonInDune,1
We're standing on the shoulders of giants and all that,RonInDune,1
So when are we running the void config for matos?,RonInDune,1
@Matos ?,Trissin,1
hey,Matos,1
i'm going to eat dinner in the next 10 mins then i'm down for it whenever you guys are,Matos,1
I'm down whenever,RonInDune,1
i wonder if its possible to do a raid today,Trissin,1
"I'd love to,  do we have enough people though?",RonInDune,1
i'm done eating,Matos,1
@PC any interest in a raid today or tomorrow?,Trissin,1
Yeah maybe,Oathbreaker,1
Got some time maybe tomorrow but I dunno,Oathbreaker,1
Just had my internet drop guys so I'm gonna try to get that fixed,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah, ofc!",Trissin,1
Hmm.... looks like there's just a big outage for my ISP so dunno if I'll be back,Oathbreaker,1
At least according to their website,Oathbreaker,1
:((,Trissin,1
"I'd be interested in a raid, but it would be a later one",Thawxtem,1
there are a bunch of us online right now.... almost enough for a raid 👀,Trissin,1
I'm super ready,RonInDune,1
@Oathbreaker care to join us?,Trissin,1
What raid were you guys thinking? I don't have a lot of time*,Oathbreaker,1
i was thinking scourge,Trissin,1
but we can do whatever,Trissin,1
I'd be in for a scourge run,Oathbreaker,1
hey @Matos still up?,Trissin,1
buddy asked for some help on path >__>,Matos,1
ooo how long is it gonna be?,Trissin,1
@Matos,Trissin,1
not sure at the moment,Matos,1
"if you have a 6th, go ahead since i don't want to keep you guys waiting",Matos,1
you are our 6th lol,Trissin,1
should we LFG for one more?,Trissin,1
"yea, sorry guys",Matos,1
oh okay,Trissin,1
its all good,Trissin,1
if i finish and you're looking i'll let you guys know when i'm done,Matos,1
Hey @Trissin are we raiding again tonight?,RonInDune,1
"If we are, I don’t get off until 9 tonight (this message posted at 2:27 for time zone conversions)",Thawxtem,1
Let's see if we have enough people first,Trissin,1
I should be able to swing that,Arixama,1
"I'm ready whenever, if we're doing it. Just ping me",Thawxtem,1
Anyone for gambit prime?,Thawxtem,1
just need protect the runner and I have dredgen,Matos,1
what are the requirements to unlock?,Thawxtem,1
"In gambit, one person had to bank 100 notes without losing any and you have to win.",Matos,1
Queenbreaker- check,Thawxtem,1
Anybody up for helping through heroic and void configuration later on?,Arixama,1
"yeah, sure",Trissin,1
Yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
Sweeet,Arixama,1
How hard is the heroic routing? I know I got up to the ||wall with the pipes and stuff||,Arixama,1
"That's almost the end of the different route. There's ||a slide, a room with some pipes, and then it's back to the fans and the normal route after that.||",Trissin,1
Wouldn't mind getting involved in a run of that myself,Oathbreaker,1
Need to do it at some point,Oathbreaker,1
normal or heroic ?,Trissin,1
Heroic,Oathbreaker,1
Need to get the catalyst and do the configuration,Oathbreaker,1
ah gotcha,Trissin,1
so same as ari,Trissin,1
Yeee,Arixama,1
It'll be Whisper all over again Ari 😂,Oathbreaker,1
So do you have to have the catalyst and then beat it again for the progress on the catalyst?,Arixama,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
wait I don't think so,Trissin,1
WAIT,Oathbreaker,1
No you don't,Oathbreaker,1
I'm just stupid don't mind me,Oathbreaker,1
Gotta do the puzzle separately though,Oathbreaker,1
^,Trissin,1
"So the first run will be catalyst, second config?",Arixama,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
Or is the config a bounty you can turn in after getting the catalyst?,Arixama,1
I don't think you can turn it in after catalyst but I could be wrong,Oathbreaker,1
"The config is like a separate objective within the heroic mission, you have to pick it up and complete it during the run. You don't need to kill the boss and actually complete the mission but you have to get to the vault at the end and do a puzzle",Trissin,1
"the puzzle will give you time though, so its not like you have to get there with like 10 minutes remaining or something",Trissin,1
"OK, I had just seen something about a bounty so I wasn't sure if it stayed in your inventory",Arixama,1
How rough is the configuration to learn?,Arixama,1
"I don't think RaidSecrets has cracked it yet, they just brute forced the puzzle lmao",Oathbreaker,1
"Well, let me know if you guys are logging on and need any help, i'm sure @RonInDune is happy to help as well!",Trissin,1
"Yeah, whenever you guys get on I'll log in, just let me know",Oathbreaker,1
I'm not sure when I'll be on,Arixama,1
"I was reading for the puzzle, which was apparently one of the harder parts. So if you need, I’d be willing to help",Thawxtem,1
Right,Oathbreaker,1
Who wants in?,Oathbreaker,1
heroic zero hour?,Buttkikker,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
im down,Buttkikker,1
Who else?,Oathbreaker,1
It would make sense for you to do it with @Arixama,Trissin,1
Catalyst obtained,Oathbreaker,1
Now just for the Void Config,Oathbreaker,1
nice!,Trissin,1
"For reference, this is the map that we used:",RonInDune,1
https://i.imgur.com/9tEQBqC.jpg,RonInDune,1
And it's perfect for the job,RonInDune,1
finally got my EP sniper,Matos,1
We got 6 people on,Oathbreaker,1
Do we want to finish Scourge?,Oathbreaker,1
sure,Trissin,1
@Matos @RonInDune scourge?,Trissin,1
Sure,RonInDune,1
"Just finished work, on my way home. Could you wait a minute?",Thawxtem,1
"yep, no problem. If we have 7, someone should take my spot",Trissin,1
Honestly I could dip out if necessary,RonInDune,1
nono its all good,Trissin,1
"I was about to log out anyway, and having you in would be more useful than not",RonInDune,1
You sure you don't want to try and get your Anarchy before me?,Oathbreaker,1
😃,Oathbreaker,1
oh i've already cleared it this week haha,Trissin,1
Oh,Oathbreaker,1
Oops lmao,Oathbreaker,1
"hey @Matos , can you join us for scourge?",Trissin,1
i wasn't really feeling like a raid right now,Matos,1
its just the last boss?,Matos,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
"yea sure, that won't take long",Matos,1
I have Chronicler!,RonInDune,1
Gratz!,Arixama,1
Congrats!,Oathbreaker,1
Thank you guys!,RonInDune,1
Couldn't have done it without you all patiently leading me through the egg collection in Shattered Throne and the raid,RonInDune,1
Congrats!,Thawxtem,1
I was also able to abuse Destiny bugs for the first time and got the 2 lore today that I'm only supposed to get one for in the DC,Thawxtem,1
Nice!!!,RonInDune,1
Do that once more and the main things holding me back will be the lore on Tangled shore heroic week and gambit lore,Thawxtem,1
"Tangled shore lore is now a guaranteed drop, so that's much easier than before when it was like 2% per",RonInDune,1
But the gambit one is tough yeah,RonInDune,1
I thought it was only available during the week Tangled shore was flashpoint,Thawxtem,1
Oh yeah only then,RonInDune,1
Iron Banana anyone?,Thawxtem,1
||Arc week solutions for Outbreak prime: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PJqjJhbvw2mUF70_h-rUq4ImIuA_TXEJxvZP8kGcwEY/htmlview?sle=true#gid=926558894||,RonInDune,1

I am,Matos,1
"i am, but i'll be home kinda late

Yeah that's fine with me,RonInDune,1
Takes no longwr than 20 mins anywau,RonInDune,1
I should still be up.,Matos,1
Im also down for it,Arixama,1
"if anyone wants to try it now, I'm down",RonInDune,1
I just got back,Trissin,1
a bit earlier than expected,Trissin,1
People want to do arc configuration and heroic?,Trissin,1
don't really know what to do but im availible,Buttkikker,1
lol no worries. it's not hard,Trissin,1
you've completed heroic before right?,Trissin,1
did void the other day but i didnt really do much to help,Buttkikker,1
"lol no problem, its all good",Trissin,1
I'm ready whenever,RonInDune,1
ill finish this iron banner match,Buttkikker,1

is that the teawrex clan or am I confusing them again?,RonInDune,1

ohh,RonInDune,1
also that's a funny clan name,RonInDune,1
Why I know all this I have no clue lol,Oathbreaker,1
ALmost as good as ours,RonInDune,1

Nah this is fun! When I was really into DOTA 2 I knew so much stuff about the teams and such,RonInDune,1
Redeem was Worlds First for Last Wish,Oathbreaker,1
Oh that's the one I remember them from,RonInDune,1
Redeem holds like 5 or 6 WFs across D1 and D2,Oathbreaker,1
Holy cow,RonInDune,1
They're some of the craziest PvE players period,Oathbreaker,1
Has it been the same people?,RonInDune,1

In Scotland though for like 4 days after launch,Oathbreaker,1
"I mean really, what's more important, taking a long needed and deserved vacation or playing a video game?",RonInDune,1
The answer is obviously video games,RonInDune,1
I don't exactly have a way to play 😂,Oathbreaker,1
I hear android emulation has a come a long way,RonInDune,1
"Yes, let me just run Destiny 2 on my LG G6 lmao",Oathbreaker,1
Invent a new branch of computers to play the game,RonInDune,1
yeah that's the guide i've been following haha,Trissin,1
lol rip Indica,Trissin,1
also I've actually queued into games with some cool people before! i've played gambit against t1 riot  and some of his guys (they absolutely destroyed us) and i've also raided with conquer and sneakybeaver before,Trissin,1
woah,RonInDune,1

@Trissin up for arc config with ari and I?,Matos,1
sure,Trissin,1
Oh no the nerfs are too much,RonInDune,1
what nerfs?,Matos,1
Maybe I'll finally start using DARCI,RonInDune,1

"Whisper got hit super hard, as did all super generating exotics",RonInDune,1
Here: ||https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47823||,RonInDune,1
WHAAAT,Matos,1
Rip Whisper,Matos,1
"I think they wanted people to use more weapons, but it's still kinda sad",RonInDune,1
Maybe outbreak will be the new boss DPS queen,RonInDune,1
seems that way but only if everyone has one i believe,Matos,1
well its already better than any primary and most powers,Buttkikker,1
until its hit like everything else,Buttkikker,1
I think whisper works similarly to the D1 gun now right? The black hammer?,RonInDune,1
black spindle,Matos,1
and yea,Matos,1
but snipers were better all around in d1 compared to d2,Matos,1
Hmm maybe this is a hint more exotic snipers are coming,RonInDune,1
that would be nice,Buttkikker,1
Oh man people are real mad about the change,RonInDune,1
"I expect whisper to be moved to special soon, honestly",Arixama,1
Oooh that's something I hadn't considered,RonInDune,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
It kinda feels like their moving it in that direction,Arixama,1
THen we need more exotic/heavy snipers,RonInDune,1
Izanagi is kinetic,RonInDune,1
"Nah, we just need better heavy exotics.",Arixama,1
True,RonInDune,1
Also I would love to run whisper/lmg,Arixama,1
at this point id prefer a good hammerhead to almost any heavy exotic,Buttkikker,1
jotunn is king,Matos,1
all hail,Matos,1
Oh yeah jotunn and graviton lance are probably my fave exotics till date,RonInDune,1
It's so satisfying,RonInDune,1
I gotta get me delirium. I'm so close,Arixama,1
Oh yeah delirium feels like infinite ammo sometimes,RonInDune,1
204 clip with overflow,Matos,1
Need 57 more envoy kills and a reset,Arixama,1
how many total is it,Buttkikker,1
350 envoys and a reset,Arixama,1
ok,Buttkikker,1
Plus some number of multikills,Arixama,1
You can check in the destiny app,Arixama,1
oh my god,Trissin,1
i just saw all this right now,Trissin,1
holy crap,Trissin,1
yup,Buttkikker,1
wow,Trissin,1
that's quite a lot,Trissin,1
"i'm really glad, though, i think whisper was too strong",Trissin,1
but now i think it's too weak,Trissin,1
"I'm mean really, whisper is still viable as a damage phase weapon, but outbreak is already becoming preferred",Arixama,1
why use whisper if its just a high impact sniper,Matos,1
outbreak will get nerfed as well,Trissin,1
in the heavy slot,Matos,1
it must,Trissin,1
Probably not super hard for like a year,Arixama,1
yeah they'll keep it around for a bit at least,Buttkikker,1
"It's a power squish. They want to entice people to use more stuff, and especially the new stuff.",Arixama,1
which will all be op probably,Buttkikker,1
beyblades will be exciting,Trissin,1
Plus they have 2 weeks to have community feedback and adjust if they feel the need.,Arixama,1
What,Arixama,1
darkdrinker,Trissin,1
isn't that the spin to win sword,Trissin,1
I never got dark drinker,Arixama,1
Sounds like it though,Arixama,1
"i wonder what other weapons we will see, i did also hear that hawkmoon might be coming back",Trissin,1
another exotic hand cannon quest inbound lol,Trissin,1
>___>,Matos,1
as someone who never played D1 i dont see the apeal in hawkmoon,Buttkikker,1
it was a boring gun,Matos,1
for boring people,Matos,1
who got lucky from time to time,Matos,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
thats basicly what i got from it,Buttkikker,1
don't @ me,Matos,1
loool,Trissin,1
I will be annoyed if dark drinker has a quest similar to d1,Arixama,1
oh god,Trissin,1
I mean it would be an actual reason to go get planetary mats,Arixama,1
lol,Trissin,1
i dont want to go through that grind again,Trissin,1
Huh I just read up on Hawkmoon it's quite an unique concept,RonInDune,1
How high was the random bullet damage?,RonInDune,1
Good for PvP,RonInDune,1
?,RonInDune,1
If the drop rate for the rarer materials is similar to what they were in year one it wouldnt be as bad.,Arixama,1
Anyone up for playing some crucible tonight? Iron banner/quickplay/comp whatever,RonInDune,1
ill probably be down,Buttkikker,1
Thanks!,RonInDune,1
just know im not too good at pvp,Buttkikker,1
Oh man neither am I,RonInDune,1
Maybe our powers combined the results will be better,RonInDune,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
@RonInDune i'm available now,Buttkikker,1
alright joining up on you,RonInDune,1
im not quite loaded in yet,Buttkikker,1
for whatever reason my game takes a million years to open,Buttkikker,1
Yeah same with me,RonInDune,1
Think it needs an SSD,RonInDune,1
Rumble counts as quick play for this week's invitation,Arixama,1
Ooh that s a good tip thanks,RonInDune,1
I'm genuinely dreading the 6 comp games though,RonInDune,1
Isn't it 3?,Arixama,1
Yeah should only be 3,Oathbreaker,1
"Not that it'll change much, with it being comp",Oathbreaker,1
"I do things on 2 chars, so 3+3 for me",RonInDune,1
Ah,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah that would do it,Oathbreaker,1
Man I need to grab some popcorn for this show. The subreddit has completely melted down. Bungee still hasn’t learned about optics.,Matos,1
"If they are buffing stuff, throw that in there with the nerfs.",Matos,1
oof yeah it's absolutely hilarious honestly,RonInDune,1
The meta has been stale anyways. I’m okay with changes.,Matos,1
I was looking up good perspective about this on youtube and there are a surprising lot of people who support this move,RonInDune,1
"^
I agree!",RonInDune,1
Because it makes sense. A lot of people are just children in adult bodies these days.,Matos,1
"I love having to work with new guns and new exotics, makes things more interesting",RonInDune,1
I predict the next most powerful exotic to be the aeon cultists stuff,RonInDune,1
"I’m still using a year 1 gun with exotics from year 1 and it’s almost year three (midnight coup, thunderlord and whisper).",Matos,1
Exactly!,RonInDune,1
And wardcliff.,Matos,1
Outbreak and jotunn are nice surprises.,Matos,1
"True, jotunn is the only ""new"" exotic that has truly taken off",RonInDune,1
though was the blue laser gun from year 1?,RonInDune,1
forgot its name.,RonInDune,1
Cold heart?,Arixama,1
yup yup,RonInDune,1
"Honestly, right now unless they bring out something that looks better, I'm gunna keep running skull no matter how they nerf it",Arixama,1
"^
same with ursas",Trissin,1
Are they reducing phoenix protocol or geomags as well?,RonInDune,1
"Also, Xur is selling Ursa today so get it if you need it!",RonInDune,1
Boy do I hate this,Arixama,1
what?,Buttkikker,1
The way crucible is today,Arixama,1
i hope they get it right in d3,Matos,1
Honestly like it was just awful cause every one was out with shotties and recluse and the games just felt like they were dragging on,Arixama,1
Games dragging on is the common theme these days and I don't know why,Oathbreaker,1
"Shotguns are still causing some issues but they'll always be the easiest weapon to use special ammo wise, and recluse continues to just be stupid incarnate as a gun",Oathbreaker,1
Anyone willing to help me with Arc Zero Hour heroic later tonight?,Thawxtem,1
"I'm grinding out strikes for Service Revolver, should really have done this sooner",Oathbreaker,1
I'll probably be in for that in the next few days,Oathbreaker,1
i just started going after that not too long ago im like 2 bounties away,Buttkikker,1
"Yeah, got like 28 more strikes to go",Oathbreaker,1
Slow going and boring lol,Oathbreaker,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
might be easier in the new season when you actually get powerful gear from it tho,Buttkikker,1
That's for Nightshade,Oathbreaker,1
i'm talking the Hand Cannon from Zavala for 40 strike completions,Oathbreaker,1
oh i thought it said bounties lol,Buttkikker,1
All good hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
"service revolver is pretty fun, are u looking for like a PvP roll @Oathbreaker ?",Trissin,1
"Of course, it's me hahaha",Oathbreaker,1
I just want an option that isn't Ace/Thorn/TLW,Oathbreaker,1
"And seeing as though Mag Howl won't be super viable, I can just use SR with a better roll",Oathbreaker,1
I tried out the default zavala roll in crucible wasn't that good honestly,RonInDune,1
Yeah there's better rolls out there,Oathbreaker,1
"So, I got D1 in today. Anyone know of a good clan there? Or do we have a clan there?",Thawxtem,1
Well I did my 6 comp matches,RonInDune,1
"Good news is, I'm no longer stuck in Brave III",RonInDune,1
"Wish I'd gone up in rank, but whatever",RonInDune,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
Hey @Thawxtem did you get to finish the arc puzzle?,RonInDune,1
"No, no one would do it with me.",Thawxtem,1
"Oh sorry, I didn't see your message @Thawxtem ! I'll be free tonight if you want to do it then",Trissin,1
If you need someone else I should also be available,Buttkikker,1
anybody for throne?,Samakain,1
"Me and @Arixama Both got it on the maze, first ST of the week",Matos,1
That's illegal,RonInDune,1
Alright so is it double or triple valour right now?,RonInDune,1
Triple,Oathbreaker,1
Till monday reset,Oathbreaker,1
oh wow,Buttkikker,1
Perfect thanks,RonInDune,1
Am really trying for the 2 resets I have left,RonInDune,1

"oof yeah sory dude, the destiny gods are fickle",RonInDune,1
"yeah. well, who knows whether or not I would have been able to get solo dul incaru on my first try anyways",Trissin,1
damn.,Trissin,1
"if you can do vorgeth, you can do dul incaru easily",RonInDune,1
:\\   it does kinda seem like that,Trissin,1

whoa! Crown of Sorrow world's first update:,Trissin,1
https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47832,Trissin,1
:OOOOO,Trissin,1
Good change imo,Oathbreaker,1
yeah holy crap,Trissin,1
No crazy insane levels of prep for a Day 1 completion,Oathbreaker,1
i still had so so much prep to do,Trissin,1
hahaha,Trissin,1
I think we in the clan can actually race this time,RonInDune,1
"i have like a BUNCH of completed bounties sitting on all 3 of my characters right now, guess i won't  need them lol",Trissin,1
I'm gone Day 1 anyways so I wasn't prepping at all lol,Oathbreaker,1
I mean keep them,Oathbreaker,1
Still useful,Oathbreaker,1
yeah of course but just wont provide a huge benefit for the day 1 race,Trissin,1
i'm so exicted haha,Trissin,1
ALso maybe they'll update the raid weapons to current gen,RonInDune,1
the year 1 weapons?,Trissin,1
yeah,RonInDune,1
that would be nice,Trissin,1
Specifically the weapons that Benny D sells,RonInDune,1
Somehow make midnight coup even better,RonInDune,1
Also @Trissin they might have done some stealth updates to the mars drop rates,RonInDune,1
I got 4 unique locations in 4 runs,RonInDune,1
whaaaattttt?!?!? 😮,Trissin,1
"I recently (in the last 2 weeks around?) opened another ~20, still no luck.",Trissin,1
"I opened 4 yesterday, all 4 were new",RonInDune,1
holy crap,Trissin,1
okay,Trissin,1
how many are you missing now?,Trissin,1
I'm 36/40,RonInDune,1
Will try to get the rest now,RonInDune,1
Let's see if it was just pure dumb luck,RonInDune,1
"if you get it before me i'll be happy for you
but also >:c",Trissin,1
Haha yeah,RonInDune,1
It's the 1KV curse,RonInDune,1
I wouldn't even consider myself lucky on that one! I got it on my 21st run,Trissin,1
"which is pretty average, I think",Trissin,1
"oh, i wonder what the new raid exotic will be for crown of sorrow",Trissin,1
i'm so excited now haha,Trissin,1
"1kv and anarchy are both really unique weapons that are fun to use, a new hive exotic weapon would be super cool",Trissin,1
Hopefully something completely new,RonInDune,1
"I imagine it will be, yeah",Trissin,1
I'd also like to see some exotic trailers,Trissin,1
"In regards to worlds first race, the power prep is still valid, since you'll be able to be at 720 in the final encounter",Arixama,1
"I guess, yeah",Trissin,1
but it's not as important as before,Trissin,1
anyone want to do some EP?,RonInDune,1
I'm on level 7 now,RonInDune,1
Got the shotgun!!!!!,RonInDune,1
Woo!,Arixama,1
Never doing EP ever again,RonInDune,1
"I got trench barrel and moving target, is that a fixed roll?",RonInDune,1
WOndering if I should masterwork it,RonInDune,1
Honestly it's good for ba machine gun frames,Arixama,1
"It's, y1 it's fixed.",Arixama,1
True true,RonInDune,1
But I can pretend,RonInDune,1
"Would you reconsider EP? Next week is strictly shotgun week, and it’s the last EP weapon I need",Thawxtem,1
"Also, anyone up for Zero Hour tonight?",Thawxtem,1
😦 opened 10 more but still didn't get it,Trissin,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1
I probably just got extraordinarily lucky,RonInDune,1
Friendly reminder:,Trissin,1
!xur,Trissin,1
"For any titans still missing it, lol.",Trissin,1
yay one eyed for all,Buttkikker,1
fuuuuun,Buttkikker,1
"AKA me, probably the one guy still missing it",Oathbreaker,1
Good roll for me too,Oathbreaker,1
So I will not be around for day 1 raid.,Arixama,1
Oh no!,RonInDune,1
rip,Buttkikker,1
Wasn't aware it was going to be launching later in the day. I've got my bachelor party that day,Arixama,1
"Woah, congrats",RonInDune,1
Please don’t have me wait until the last minute again this week- is anyone willing to do the final Zero Hour(s) tonight in about 8 hours with me?,Thawxtem,1
yup,Buttkikker,1
I'll try!,RonInDune,1
I should be around for a last minute run *tonight*,Oathbreaker,1
Not on Monday,Oathbreaker,1
"Just logged in, ready whenever",Thawxtem,1
same,Buttkikker,1
i'm around for heroic and solar config,Matos,1
Cool! join the fireteam chat and I'll tell you when I'm done with this quest. then we all join up and finish Outbreak!,Thawxtem,1
@Matos waiting on you,Thawxtem,1
"If you guys want, here's the infographic I use:||https://i.imgur.com/lz7cIrT.png||",RonInDune,1

The 4th,Arixama,1
oh,Matos,1
"This Tuesday is the last reset of the season, then next Tuesday is opulence",Arixama,1
Also starting next Tuesday 3x infamy,Arixama,1
"So this might be a dumb question, but power level/actual level does not matter in comp right?",RonInDune,1
"Not a dumb question, I'm pretty sure it doesn't matter",Trissin,1
I think it's only Iron Banner and gambit in which power matters for pvp,Trissin,1
Ah thanks,RonInDune,1
I had a couple of comp games last time I played where I got wrecked with some dude in a level 20 with a not forgotten,RonInDune,1
who would be interested in some  scourge of the past?,Buttkikker,1
"Sure, when were u thinking?",Trissin,1
i should be available whenever,Buttkikker,1
so mostly whenever other people are able,Buttkikker,1
"Sure, let's see if we can get a run going tonight. Others interested in scourge? @PC",Trissin,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4AoVUamhxo,Matos,1
ooh,Trissin,1
"@Trissin @Buttkikker I'd be interested in scourge. Granted, I'm still learning some seeing as I've been more focused on memorizing Last Wish.",Thawxtem,1
so i think i am going to pick up the base game with CoO and Warmind today just to experience D2 in high fps lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Why not just get the version of forsaken that comes with all of them?,Arixama,1
well I'm only gonna be taking my PS4 back to college and with Penumbra out soon i really won't be playing it that much on PC.,thegoaliebear,1
What's the price difference on them?,Arixama,1
$39.99 for the forsaken and my local gamestop has the base D2+expansions for $12 aha,thegoaliebear,1
That makes way more sense 🤣,Arixama,1
hahaha yeah i thought about getting the forsaken one but when i saw the price on the base i was like...yeah,thegoaliebear,1
"wow, so my gamestop had the forsaken legendary collection for 29.99...worth.",thegoaliebear,1
Niiiiice,Arixama,1
Even better,Arixama,1
for real...it was 59.99 on Blizzard website...that bonkers,thegoaliebear,1
Is that the one with the annual pass too?,Arixama,1
nope. the one with annual pass is 79.99 on Blizzard.,thegoaliebear,1
love to see it LOL.,thegoaliebear,1

😂 i just got off of work,Arixama,1
@here I'll likely start some D2 tomorrow on PC. if any of yall wanna add me my bnet is goaliebear#1614. not sure if I'll look to do endgame stuff since I'll have to get back to PS4 soon for Penumbra but if anyone feels like joining me as i play through the stories again lol feel free to lmk. would be happy to play with you guys since I'll be switching to PC completely for D3.,thegoaliebear,1

"Does anyone still need EP shotgun this week? also, what was the warmind strike that gave an exclusive weapon?",Thawxtem,1
"Strange Terrain, for braytech osprey",Trissin,1
I can grind EP with you on the weekend if needed.,RonInDune,1
I just wish they dropped resonant stems,RonInDune,1
^^^^^,Trissin,1
I still have so much prep to do before the dlc,Trissin,1
"Also, ||apparently parts of the leviathan got Taken or something||",RonInDune,1
"Not sure if others are interested, but here is a power leveling guide:

https://i.imgur.com/q7S5VO0.jpg",Trissin,1
Oh I saw that in the trailer,Trissin,1
that will be pretty interesting,Trissin,1
"I'm gunna be honest, there's no reason not to just fully have the blind well bounty done.",Arixama,1
Doesn't doing the blind well give you a powerful?,RonInDune,1
Not the bounty. It gives you powerful on your first completion of the week.,Arixama,1
Ohh,RonInDune,1
"It counts towards the weekly bounty completions which give powerful gear, but the bounty itself just gives you baryon boughs and and offering",Arixama,1
I think the reason the bounty is 50% because you should do a tier 4 clear for the powerful anyways,Trissin,1
so you dont really need to do two completions to prep,Trissin,1
"Also previous Flashpoint won't award powerful gear unless they are the Flashpoint that week, unless they changed it.",Arixama,1
Just watched the trailer || what people are saying is dark drinker is definitely enternitys edge||,Arixama,1
Oooh ||what weapon is that?||,RonInDune,1
||year one warlock sword||,Arixama,1
Them Titan boots are back. Hopefully they buff thunder crash.,Matos,1
I'm also not convinced that ||it is actually hawkmoon||,Arixama,1
It’s not. The subreddit has images of the new gear and a HC has the same model.,Matos,1
It still *could* be,Arixama,1
Cause It definitely looks like it,Arixama,1
But there also a shotgun with the same barrel style,Arixama,1
"Hmm, ||looking closer at the new weapon ""Lumina"", it looks like there's thorns sticking out of it. Wonder if it's related to the Malfeasance||",RonInDune,1
"||With the bud at the bottom of the handle and the actual shape of the gun, it's more likely to have to do with Rose||",Arixama,1
Ok I've been watching some ||truth videos and it's absolutely insane||,RonInDune,1
LOOOL,Trissin,1
||Like what the heck! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTk2_MBYFGA&feature=youtu.be||,RonInDune,1
"Also that's  such a cool map, and I have no idea what's going on there",RonInDune,1
@Oathbreaker can tell you all about it,Trissin,1
"||With the direction they've been taking the story in regards to shin malphur, the shadows of Yor and everything else, and with a gun coming up that heavily looks like it could be the Rose, I'm really hoping we're going to get lore on Rezyl Azzir||",Arixama,1
That hand cannon looks dope. But will probably collect dust in the vault.,Matos,1
Why even waste vault space on it?,Arixama,1

"||Fucking Truth man, the amount of rocket powered bullshittery you could do with that thing is insane||",Oathbreaker,1
||Also Trissin were you referring to the map I could elaborate on or Truth itself?||,Oathbreaker,1
i was talking about rift,Trissin,1
RIFT,Oathbreaker,1
WAS THE MOST FUCKING FUN MODE,Oathbreaker,1
I MISS IT DEARLY,Oathbreaker,1
BUNGO GIVE RIFT,Oathbreaker,1
lool,Trissin,1
It was fun and it makes me sad that it's gone,Oathbreaker,1
Literally reverse CTF,Oathbreaker,1
But it was so fun,Oathbreaker,1
"You could spawn kill for days though, really wasn't designed with spawn protection in mind",Oathbreaker,1
"Oh man wonder why they removed it then, it sounds fun!",RonInDune,1
Also looked very confusing from the video,RonInDune,1
Basically they tried to replicate it with Breakthrough but we all know how well implemented Breakthrough was....,Oathbreaker,1
breakthrough oof,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"Not super confusing, go to neutral location, pick thing up, run to opponents side of the map",Oathbreaker,1
There were some really fucking cool strats too,Oathbreaker,1
6 man Bubble Titans building a Bubble train to flag dropoff lmao,Oathbreaker,1
"I saw the ||truth rocket projectile follow a guy for half the map, that was kinda broken||",RonInDune,1
||There's videos out there of Truth rockets tracking the person who fired the rocket around the entire map to kill them||,Oathbreaker,1
||Or the person they're locked onto||,Oathbreaker,1
"But the rift map looked so epic, wonder why they didn't bring it back for normal PvP",RonInDune,1
Vertigo was fun but unbalanced,Oathbreaker,1
It also suffered from being on Mercury and having your eyes blinded by the Sun,Oathbreaker,1
Oh man I love this new helmet,RonInDune,1

Anyone excited for the new pinnacle weapons?? I'm looking forward to the ||gambit bow||,Trissin,1
"||I'm interested in the Crucible Sniper, if that thing has snapshot I'll be 1800 the day I get back, I though I saw an Ambush scope||",Oathbreaker,1
They don't sound too great compared to past ones,Matos,1
Probably stick to my delirium and breakneck,Matos,1
I wonder how much ||blast radius and damage the grenade launcher gets from picking up orbs||,Trissin,1
"||If that Sniper is a 140, has snapshot and an Ambush scope I'll never use anything else every again. Ambush was my favorite low zoom scope period||",Oathbreaker,1
The Grenade launcher is the only one that really catches my eye.,Samakain,1
"I hope || the bow has atleast 
 two of explosive head/dragonfly/rampage, otherwise it'll be completely useless in gambit||",RonInDune,1
"actually im not sure about explosive head, because that reduces precision damage",Trissin,1
huh I never realized that,RonInDune,1
"yeah, a bow with explosive head does less damage compared to a bow without explosive head on precision hits",Trissin,1
it will do more on body shots though,Trissin,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
"I noticed recently that explosive shots flinches people hard in crucible, though I suppose that doesn't help in PvE",RonInDune,1
One thing I wish got buffed was the dragonfly explosions in crucible,RonInDune,1
They should kill!,RonInDune,1
Also did anyone see the latest Death Stranding trailer? It's kinda weird.,RonInDune,1
Is there anyone here who is willing to help me with a Gambit achievement (and possible lose a lot)?,Thawxtem,1
Explosive rounds/arrows do guaranteed bodyshot damage that ignores falloff but otherwise does less damage than a regular bullet/arrow,Oathbreaker,1
what do you need @Thawxtem ?,Trissin,1
I need to swipe 3 motes from the other side,Thawxtem,1
Ohh that one took me a while too,RonInDune,1
playing Hunter Nightstalker,Thawxtem,1
"My suggestion, go in as a invis hunter or ultra defensive titan",RonInDune,1
Ah ok that's the best choice,RonInDune,1
Put on the invis helmets and just sneak around and steal the motes and then hide,RonInDune,1
So no one here?,Thawxtem,1
I can jump in later tonight,RonInDune,1
"ill play some gambit, sure",Trissin,1
I'm down for some gambit as well.  And if anyone wants to help me grab my outbreak later I'd appreciate it.,Samakain,1
@Samakain I'd be happy to help with both. Are you good at invading? I need an invader for Malfesance since I'm terrible at that one role,Thawxtem,1
"oh yeah, im down to help with outbreak @Samakain",Trissin,1
^^ that too. I kinda like the quest now. It's fun to me.,Thawxtem,1
"I will let someone else go if they don't have it yet, though, since I would be helping for fun",Thawxtem,1
"I am an egar invader, with varying amounts of compedence 😛",Samakain,1
"yeah, just realized I need to kill a lot as invader, crossing my fingers that I can somehow kill all 4",Thawxtem,1
can't cheese it with only teammate kills,Thawxtem,1
Run bottom tree dawnblade,Arixama,1
"Honestly i got that mainly through  lucky nova bomb, didn't have much to do with skill. It took me a while and was pretty frustrating.",Samakain,1
That it also good advice.,Samakain,1
It's got the seeking bolts,Arixama,1
"I'm playing gambit now, I'll try that. thanks",Thawxtem,1
😮,Trissin,1
twab is out,Trissin,1
the chalice seems really cool,Trissin,1
it'll probably take the destiny community like _at least_ 2 minutes to ||probably brute force all the rune combinations to get exactly what you want lol||,Trissin,1
also a lot more info on the pinnacle weapons!!!,Trissin,1
"@Oathbreaker ||you called it, revoker has the special low-zoom ambush on it||",Trissin,1
||also this season's PVP pinnacle doesn't need you to hit a certain competitive rank!! only acquire points!||,Trissin,1
||IT BETTER HAVE FUCKING SNAPSHOT BUNGIE||,Oathbreaker,1
LOL,Trissin,1
||Oh? Interesting move. I kind of like that||,Oathbreaker,1
||IF THEY GIVE ME A FUCKING LOW ZOOM SNIPER WITHOUT SNAPSHOT OR QUICKDRAW I WILL SMASH MY HEAD INTO A WALL||,Oathbreaker,1
Does the GL have spike grenades?,Matos,1
||OR USE THE REVOKER WITH OBSIDIAN ASPECTS||,Oathbreaker,1
looks like swords got buffed overall,Trissin,1
**ooooh i like that crown of sorrow emblem**,Trissin,1
im going to finish it in the first 24,Trissin,1
it might kill me but im gonna do it,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"OMG THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGE WE NEEDED.

Oh cripes the 24 hour emblem look sooo goood,RonInDune,1
right?!?!?!? ahhhh i want it so bad,Trissin,1
confirmed hive themed raid?,Matos,1
"Not sure about confirmed, but it _really_ seems like it. The emblem, **""sorrow""**, and the lack of a hive raid for a _long_ time are good indicators",Trissin,1
Oh man this weeks MOTW is the greatest,RonInDune,1
The TR3-VR Perfected one,RonInDune,1
Oooh they're adding catalysts!,RonInDune,1
Oh they're finally adding the faction rally catalysts back in,Arixama,1
Trials is next 🤣,Arixama,1
THAT SWORD BUFF THOUGH 😍😍😍,Arixama,1
"finally, my first title",Matos,1
"Heck yeah dude, congrats!",RonInDune,1
got my taken sparrow too!,Matos,1
close to a few other titles,Matos,1

Nice!,RonInDune,1
"You could've waited a couple of days though, to get a powerful reward at the start of the season",RonInDune,1
^^^^,Trissin,1
"Deal is, I thought I had to go through a special strike or something. I remember doing it with Helatia",Thawxtem,1
I believe the strike is towards the begging of the quest . But it does feel like it should be at the end i made that mistake too,Buttkikker,1
Strike is like step 2,Oathbreaker,1
I've got 3 says to get 2 gambit resets. Is it possible?,Arixama,1
pick up all bounties on toons every day,Matos,1
triple infamy,Trissin,1
and hope you get a good streak,Matos,1
Going for the ghost shell?,Trissin,1
Yeah. Just need that and protect the runner for dredge,Arixama,1
"Damn, good luck!",Trissin,1
I just need the ghost shell but I don't think I'm going to be bothered to chase it,Trissin,1
protect the runner....,Matos,1
"Protect the runner is still 100,isn't it?",Arixama,1
Actually I think it was made easier,Trissin,1
Oh my god it's only 75 now,Arixama,1
I'm not sure if that's actually easier though. Just more balanced.,Arixama,1
Ari why do you always leave the resets stuff until the very end of a season??,Oathbreaker,1
"OK, last season it was because they didn't do the double triple Valor boost on the last iron banner like they did for every single other one we've had",Arixama,1
qw56yhn;l.,Buttkikker,1
lol my bird got on my keyboard,Buttkikker,1
"I'd watch a stream of Bird Plays Destiny, set to the Seinfeld soundtrack",RonInDune,1

oh nice,Buttkikker,1
!!! congrats!!!!,Trissin,1
My first crucible pinnacle!!!,RonInDune,1
Thank you!,RonInDune,1
Now what are the odds of going from 868 glory to 2100 before the reset,RonInDune,1
depends on how much you grind mostly,Buttkikker,1
but i think you could do it,Buttkikker,1
I'll try then! What can possible go wrong...,RonInDune,1
I'm definitely not getting 2 more infamy resets,Arixama,1
if you want i can help im just unsure if my rank would mess with the matchmaking,Buttkikker,1
"Also I won a couple of rumble matches using nothing but a trace rifle, so I'm obviously a crucible god now",RonInDune,1
Haven't even made it home from work yet.,Arixama,1
"@Buttkikker I think it probably would, but maybe next season when everyone is playing again might be easier",RonInDune,1
yeah probably,Buttkikker,1
I definitely want to try for 2100 next season,Arixama,1
I'll tag along with you then Ari,RonInDune,1
"Plus, the new one is like 3500 or something cumulative points?",Arixama,1
I think so? I'm not sure if losses subtract from that or what,RonInDune,1
nope,Buttkikker,1
for the new sniper losses wont subtract,Buttkikker,1
That's perfect!,RonInDune,1
If it's good in PvE I might even use it,RonInDune,1
i kinda doubt it,Buttkikker,1
seems very crucible oriented,Buttkikker,1
@RonInDune you got a link for where all the lore things are?,Arixama,1
This is the one I used: ||https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9ewfs0/all_available_dead_ghosts_lootable_lore_triumphs/||,RonInDune,1
Have any of you guys heard the creepy voices in the EDZ before? Like this one from reddit: https://youtu.be/gMVzYXFgwps?t=20,RonInDune,1
Spooky!,RonInDune,1
"No, I haven't! Wow",Trissin,1
"If I worked at Bungie, I would start putting random savanthun whispers in certain places and add in hive ritual stuff in key locations.",Matos,1
That would be horrifying,RonInDune,1
Exactly!,Matos,1
Creep people out! The deep will consume us!,Matos,1
I remember they did that in the F.E.A.R. games and it scared me so much that I never never completed the 2nd game,RonInDune,1
I love fear! The Hive are great fodder for stuff like that.,Matos,1
hellblade did a super good job using whispers for all its gameplay,Arixama,1
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47849,Arixama,1
Ohhhhh dang,RonInDune,1
I am so ready,RonInDune,1
Also wait what's owl sector?,RonInDune,1
https://www.destinypedia.com/Owl_Sector,Arixama,1
Oooh thanks,RonInDune,1
Was a precursor to rise of iron and all the siva stuff in D1 apparently,Arixama,1
"So Bungie just put me into a game of crucible, and as soon as I load in, I hear ""I've seen enough, I'm calling this one"" and I lose my winstreak",Trissin,1
:(((,Trissin,1
You shouldn't lose your winstreak if you get matched midgame though?,Arixama,1
That's weird,Arixama,1
oh wait really?,Trissin,1
hold on,Trissin,1
oh yeah,Trissin,1
still a loss on record but whatevs,Trissin,1
W/L is dumb anyways,Oathbreaker,1
I've got like a 62% W/L overall,Oathbreaker,1
But individually for clash and control in QP I'm over like 70% or something ridiculous,Oathbreaker,1
Do they have individual matchmaking for the game modes?,RonInDune,1
!pvp,RonInDune,1
"Yeah so 62% overall, with Control being 70.7% and Clash being 80%, only way I can work it out is it also factors in IB which would be 61.5% for me",Oathbreaker,1
"No, but most of the tracking sites track individual game types as well as playlists",Arixama,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
"No, but the DestinyTracker website can sort by individual modes",Oathbreaker,1
Hold on I'll link my page as an example,Oathbreaker,1
https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/pc/Oathbreaker-11137,Oathbreaker,1
i wonder what my profile says,Matos,1
Mine is just a giant banner that say SUBPAR,Arixama,1
https://destinytracker.com/d2/profile/pc/matos-1219,Matos,1
look at that gambit,Matos,1
whats up,Matos,1
"*Ewwwww Gambit*

Kinda joking not really?",Oathbreaker,1
Gambit is the greatest thing Bungie has done since Halo reach,Matos,1
refreshing and new multiplayer mode,Matos,1
Hard disagree from me but I respect that take,Oathbreaker,1
"Definitely can be fun, I just don't find that enjoyment in it",Oathbreaker,1
Give me 6 other guardians to step in a ring with and I'm a happy (mostly) man,Oathbreaker,1
"if crucible was more like d1, i would care more about d2 pvp. so i'm glad they added something outside of pve",Matos,1
"the big thing is d1 had better maps, where are the d1 maps?",Matos,1
and the dunking game mode,Matos,1
that map with the train in the middle and open areas on the side,Matos,1
The one from Y3?,Oathbreaker,1
i think it came with taken king,Matos,1
"Also, yeah, D1 maps are far better",Oathbreaker,1
"Oh, on Earth?",Oathbreaker,1
yea,Matos,1
"I think we just need to get oath in gambit with a good team. Solo queues are just always a crap shoot, and feels a lot like year 1 d1 pvp in terms of matchmaking.",Arixama,1
i mostly solo queued my three resets this season,Matos,1
and it was brutal sometimes,Matos,1
don't recommend,Matos,1
"I just find that Gambit is too centered around invading, and you can get utterly fucked by having no heavy drop while the other team has heavy ammo pinatas 24/7",Oathbreaker,1
"Because there's only four players on a team, theres a huge margin for error, and communication makes a load of difference.",Arixama,1
"Great idea, execution has fallen a little flat IMO",Oathbreaker,1
heavy is exclusive to invaders then sentries until primeval stage,Matos,1
"The beta test for it, along with the initial stages were absolutely fun",Oathbreaker,1
there is always one brick that spawns just before first portal goes up,Matos,1
so the invader gets that one,Matos,1
I think having a fallen/taken armaments on your invader breaks the game a bit,RonInDune,1
_Several people are typing_...,Trissin,1
"I'm talking gambit in general, not just prime",Oathbreaker,1
"With heavy ammo finders and armament mods, heavy ammo economy is way better",Arixama,1
"^
Im not sure, heavy ammo finder doesn't seem to do anything for me",Trissin,1
"prime is the better version of gambit, regular gambit isn't worth the time i feel",Matos,1
Parcel of Stardust disagrees with you,Oathbreaker,1
I'm still playing regular gambit to get the 25 thorn kills for the triumph,RonInDune,1
"well as @Arixama knows how I feel, heavy ammo is busted in D2 because they set up the entire game to have that modifier for ammo",Matos,1
Another core problem with D2 which makes me impatient for D3,Matos,1
I want Ruin Wings,Trissin,1
Heavy needs to be tuned,Oathbreaker,1
"I tend to try and only run a single finder, and save heavy for primeval damage",Arixama,1
Like in Crucible if you don't have heavy you can just get run over,Oathbreaker,1
I find that as long as you give invader all the guaranteed heavys your good,Buttkikker,1
"But wait, the place you want for map control is away from heavy and if you go to get it your blueberries will inevitably fuck up defending the spot you want control over",Oathbreaker,1
"I do really like the roles the brought in for prime, because that adds in more concrete roles in regular gambit as well.",Arixama,1
But having invader be a heavy-centric meta is a little stupid IMO,Oathbreaker,1
with outbreak you dont need heavy anyway,Buttkikker,1
I mean I just don't like heavy in PvP encounters so I'm biased with regards to that,Oathbreaker,1
but thats if you even want to use it,Buttkikker,1
pvp playlist with no heavy and supers?,Matos,1
too much for bungie,Matos,1
PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE PLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASEPLEASE,Oathbreaker,1
GIVE ME THAT MODE AND I WILL NEVER NOT PLAY IT,Oathbreaker,1
"Oath, you need to get in a gambit match with Matos. He's a good invader out of necessity.",Arixama,1
"That requires playing gambit :)

I'll play it at some point during the new season but it's not my priority tbh. I want that fucking ||Revoker||.",Oathbreaker,1
Did you guys catch the Halo reach PC gameplay?,RonInDune,1
"I was surprised at how familiar the movement looked, coming from destiny",RonInDune,1
Oh God Halo Reach on PC will be glorious,Oathbreaker,1
Halo on PC in general will be so good,Oathbreaker,1
"I mean, can you imagine being able to go through a campaign with three other people?",Arixama,1
Oh lord just give me the multiplayer,Oathbreaker,1
I tried Splitgate and it just was too Halo to the point I wanted to play halo on PC,Oathbreaker,1
yea i'm always down for gambit and Ari is right. I'm an invader because pugs suck and i just started doing it because no one else would or would be bad at it,Matos,1
Boy do I need the machinist mission,Arixama,1
Also gotta go for that 3 mote triumph,Arixama,1
Is there anyone here who isn't in a group for the new raid that would like to be?,Thawxtem,1

i guess i never looked at the councilors up close,Trissin,1
You never know until you try!,RonInDune,1
They're fancy Psions,Oathbreaker,1
Don't have a controller to do so hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
That'd make for an interesting challenge though,RonInDune,1
Something like Solo Shattered Throne on a phone,RonInDune,1
That would be ridiculous lmao,Oathbreaker,1
I suppose if it were possible one of those youtubers would have done it already,RonInDune,1
Kackis?,RonInDune,1
Or wait no esoterrick,RonInDune,1
Kackis would get stuck on saying his intro,Oathbreaker,1
I don't think Esoterrick has tried to do something like that,Oathbreaker,1
Man I wish we'd managed to finish Niobe Labs,RonInDune,1
I want to try that at some point,Oathbreaker,1
Me @Trissin and @danny gave it a good try a couple of times,RonInDune,1
Got to the very last stage but couldn't finish,RonInDune,1
Maybe now with outbreak it'd be easier,RonInDune,1
So I just heard some ambient dialog from Ana Bray that might be reference to the raid?,RonInDune,1
you just ______ some dialog?,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
She said ||Rasputin detected a lot of Guardian traffic at a place called the weep. The strange part is no bullets were fired.||,RonInDune,1
😮,Trissin,1
interesting!!,Trissin,1
||Maybe that's  a location in the raid?||,RonInDune,1
Is the weep somewhere on the leviathan maybe?,Trissin,1
That's be pretty cool!,RonInDune,1
No that is a faction rally reference.,Matos,1
oh?,Trissin,1
When people would run in and out of that lost sector on earth.,Matos,1
"ohhh that's a lost sector, duh",RonInDune,1
I'm dumb,RonInDune,1
there's a lost sector called the weep?,Trissin,1
"Oh trissin I finally got the frigid jackal, I'm just the nightfall weapon away from wayfarer",RonInDune,1
nice!! i'll be on the lookout for strange terrain,Trissin,1
let me know if you need a hand farming it,Trissin,1
"I don't think it'd be worth equipping over ""chronicler"" or ""cursebreaker"", but still a cool seal to have!",Trissin,1
Yeah the weep is in winding cove right as drop down,RonInDune,1
ohh that one,Trissin,1
True true,RonInDune,1
I'm also two nodes away lol,RonInDune,1
From the final,RonInDune,1
:ooooooo,Trissin,1
"still haven't gotten mine, lol",Trissin,1
i made 5 more frequencies yesterday,Trissin,1
It's such an annoying grind,RonInDune,1
_indeed_,Trissin,1
what do you get out of it?,Buttkikker,1
Is there atleast an emblem for completing?,RonInDune,1
Peace of mind mostly,RonInDune,1
"there is an emblem, yeah",Trissin,1
warminded,Trissin,1
Oh dang okay that's a cool emblem,RonInDune,1
That makes up for it,RonInDune,1
kinda,RonInDune,1
I'm still at 38/40 after literally over a year. i just gave up lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
i've been at 39/40 for about a year now as well,Trissin,1
haha,Trissin,1
i'm just not letting rng get the best of me anymore lol. nearly quit the game after months of needing 1kv for Rivensbane.,thegoaliebear,1
hoping with this seasons title they get rid of all that rng crap for it.,thegoaliebear,1
lol,Trissin,1
how many runs????,Trissin,1
@thegoaliebear,Trissin,1
Have they fixed the RNG in the titles in the new titles?,RonInDune,1
probably not @RonInDune,Trissin,1
:((,Trissin,1
39. not nearly as many as others have. but it was awful.,thegoaliebear,1
:travelergoogly:,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune they haven't. Reckoner still requires rng drops from the reckoning. it's bs.,thegoaliebear,1
i won't be needing the warminded emblem after i get this one:,Trissin,1
ahh so hyped!!!,Trissin,1
haha well good luck. hope you guys get the day 1 clear.,thegoaliebear,1
That is such a cool emblem darn,RonInDune,1
You can do it!,RonInDune,1
I'll be rooting for ya,RonInDune,1
"ty, you as well! been prepping like crazy",Trissin,1
I did the entire quest for the last word again yesterday ( _oh god so much pvp help_ ),Trissin,1
hoping rng is kind to me with milestone drops tomorrow lol.,thegoaliebear,1
After finishing the redrix grind I don't to do PvP anymore for a bit,RonInDune,1
Is it just me or is CoS being significantly more hyped than Scourge?,RonInDune,1
definitly,Buttkikker,1
"I think people are just a lot more excited in general, yeah",Trissin,1
Because it's been a while since a hive raid,Trissin,1
plus scourge is a little underwhelming,Buttkikker,1
"^^^
that",Trissin,1
scourge was cleared not even 2 hours after release,Trissin,1
THat last hive raid the one where they killed Oryx right?,RonInDune,1
I've been watching a Destiny 1 LP to brush up on the story and that expansion was pretty cool,RonInDune,1
"yeah, that's the one",Trissin,1
definitely super interesting,Trissin,1
They had a special ammo auto rifle in that one I think,RonInDune,1
"from what I'm seeing, crown of sorrow was designed by the same people who came out with spire",Trissin,1
"for reference, only 19 teams beat spire day one",Trissin,1
Oooh so it'll be mechanics heavy and tough as heck,RonInDune,1
I hope so!!,Trissin,1
"the sandbox challenge is definitely going to be pretty significant, people can't level like crazy",Trissin,1
Yup it'll be a true test of communication and skill,RonInDune,1
Trissin does the nightshade pulse quest drop as powerful?,RonInDune,1
"I don't think it drops as a powerful reward, but it's at your current power level",Trissin,1
so it could be useful,Trissin,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
Then no need to rush the bounties then thanks,RonInDune,1
"yep, np",Trissin,1
Does the whisper drop as powerful?,RonInDune,1
Then I might run it,RonInDune,1
"I don't think so, only the exotics released in/after forsaken",Trissin,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
So outbreak would?,RonInDune,1
"outbreak should, yeah",Trissin,1
I also think I have the thunderlord quest half completed on one character,RonInDune,1
nice!,Trissin,1
@Trissin Last word is not that bad of a quest,Oathbreaker,1
Thorn is the worse out of those two,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, youre right - thorn is a lot longer. But still, I'm not a huge fan of PVP so it felt tedious to play so much pvp and get all the medals and stuff again",Trissin,1
the ace of spades quest went by a lot faster than I expected,Trissin,1
fun fact,Arixama,1
my titan will be 700 before i have all three forsaken super fully unlocked,Arixama,1
my warlock still hasnt finished nova warp lol,Trissin,1
i literally just need a helmet,Arixama,1
and then 700,Arixama,1
i still have the full commander tre to unlock pretty much,Arixama,1
holy crap these resist mods are ridiculous,Trissin,1
Did you get one?,RonInDune,1
i did,Trissin,1
trying to get more,Trissin,1
I saw the drop rates being ridiculously low and decided against it,RonInDune,1
Dang congrats,RonInDune,1
I just got here and I'm busy/lazy. what we talkin 'bout?,Thawxtem,1
You can get Major/Boss resist mods from the armour drops in the reckoning,RonInDune,1
Which are fairly useful since they give give a flat damage resistance stat,RonInDune,1
I've gone through about 80 synths now i think,Trissin,1
chaos reach is a lot of fun,Matos,1
So it is!,RonInDune,1
"I wish it were a bit easier to see the screen when it's activated, but that's a minor concern",RonInDune,1
i'm still hoping for thunderblast buffs,Matos,1
or titan pve buffs,Matos,1
700 on characters,Arixama,1
Remember to get the xur exotic if you haven't already,RonInDune,1
still not done with the code of commander 😂,Arixama,1
Do Blind well! That's how I completed all the subtrees,RonInDune,1
@Trissin have you unlocked the forges on all your charcters?,Arixama,1
"I have not, only volundr",Trissin,1
"But that's enough, because it allows access to ringing nail and hammerhead",Trissin,1
"ok, cause if you hadnt, the volundr unlock frame doesnt go away at reset so it would just take an ignition",Arixama,1
"Oh, I see",Trissin,1
Any suggestions for getting the 21% delirium?,Trissin,1
I know quite a few people here have it,Trissin,1
I'm at 75% on envoy/primevil kills. thats all im missing,Trissin,1
@Matos got it quickest amongst us,RonInDune,1
How many more do you need? It's like 350 total,Arixama,1
All I did was play regular gambit,RonInDune,1
oh my god 350?,Trissin,1
does that mean I have like 80 envoy kills left or something,Trissin,1
You should be able to check on the destiny app,Arixama,1
It give the actual number values for the triumph,Arixama,1
from what I've observed it's 1% for an envoy kill and 2% for a primevil kill,Trissin,1
"I'd almost suggest running normal gambit with tractor cannon honestly. Potential for six envoys in a match, all with void shields.",Arixama,1
Plus 1 to 2 primeval kills,Arixama,1
if you're not in a team normal gambit is best. if you're with a team prime is better to just farm envoy kills there.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh, all good suggestions, ty!",Trissin,1
Content day guys (least where I am) good luck and I'm rooting for you guys!,Oathbreaker,1
Thanks oath!,Trissin,1
When are you back?,Trissin,1
We'll run through crown,Trissin,1
Saturday late,Oathbreaker,1
I'm gonna try and pick up a blind run at some point in the week following,Oathbreaker,1
"Guys Jason Schrier and Kotaku has massive spoilers for the next season locations and names and stuff, so be wary",RonInDune,1
"It all stuff data mined from the patch, basically the pre-order page for next expansiom",Arixama,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
Oh they buffed Aeon Soul! I am a prophet!,RonInDune,1
@Trissin Would you be able to invite me to the clan?,Buttkikker,1
"@Buttkikker DM me your Bungie account name and all that, I'll look into if I can get you invited if Trissin hasn't already done so, especially if he's done that temporary leaving to get a more raid focused temporary one",Oathbreaker,1
"Trissin, just so you know when you do eventually look at Discord again, I've invited him into the clan and we're all good.",Oathbreaker,1
"Awesome, thanks Oath",Trissin,1
appreciate it,Trissin,1
"Not a problem dude, keep up the grind. Kick some ass and good luck to your group!",Oathbreaker,1
Good luck everyone @PC who's attempting the raid!,RonInDune,1
I certainly hope @Arixama  isn't attempting the raid tonight. 😛,TheCnC,1
"I'm so glad I'm not, I'd feel like I'd be unreliable cause it is currently raining super hard and the tornado sirens are Goin off",Arixama,1
It'll be done in about an hour it looks like.,TheCnC,1
Dang that'd be the perfect ambience,RonInDune,1
"Massive wall cloud is slamming us now, then shortly after you, then dissipating it seems judging by the radar.",TheCnC,1
Run stormcaller,RonInDune,1
Yo I didn't expect the skull nerf to be SO HARD,Arixama,1
ikr,Buttkikker,1
lol,Trissin,1
Disappointed in you guys.,Matos,1
No one told me about THE JOTUNN BUFF,Matos,1
there's a jotunn buff?,Trissin,1
10%,Matos,1
"On some things, in the patch notes on the subreddit.",Matos,1
Toaster meta!,Matos,1
Wow that took a long time,RonInDune,1
Almost 5 hours,RonInDune,1
i'm pretty sure they fixed heavy ammo finder,Matos,1
Holy crap really?,RonInDune,1
gatdang,RonInDune,1
i have it on almost eveyr piece because i didn't know it was busted,Matos,1
"today, purple bricks are raining from the sky",Matos,1
in every activity i do,Matos,1
So Esoterickk got it,RonInDune,1
hope any of you guys doing the raid are going well :) we got the first encounter down on PS4.,thegoaliebear,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
My team is still on the final boss,Trissin,1
You got this!,RonInDune,1
Progress is slow but we're getting there,Trissin,1
thanks ron!,Trissin,1
BTW what's the raid exotic??,Trissin,1
yeah good luck!,Buttkikker,1
im SO CURIOUS,Trissin,1
ty buttkikker!,Trissin,1
good luck to you as well @thegoaliebear !,Trissin,1
'Tarrabah',RonInDune,1
what is it???,Trissin,1
:oooo,Trissin,1
exotic smg,RonInDune,1
what the heck???,Trissin,1
in what slot?,Trissin,1
and what does it do??,Trissin,1
energy,RonInDune,1
guessing it's void,Trissin,1
And it stores up damage when dealing or receiving damage,RonInDune,1
😮 interesting!!!,Trissin,1
no it's solar I think,RonInDune,1
I forgot,RonInDune,1
Datto was super salty and deleted it,RonInDune,1
what???,Trissin,1
datto got it?!? i thought he was 2nd,Trissin,1
He though he was first cause the gun dropped for him,RonInDune,1
But he was like a couple of minutes,RonInDune,1
late,RonInDune,1
ONly 5 completions so far?,RonInDune,1
"Hey @Trissin , would you be willing to help my group when you guys finish?",Thawxtem,1
Not sure how long we'll be here!,Trissin,1
Still stuck on final boss rn,Trissin,1
it's pretty tough,Trissin,1
"it is, but poeple have two phased using mountaintop",RonInDune,1
our team doesn't have mountaintop 😦,Trissin,1
ive got until about 10 tommorow so about 12 hours,Buttkikker,1
3 phase using outbreak then?,RonInDune,1
thats what we're trying but we'll see,Trissin,1
gotta get back now,Trissin,1
to focus,Trissin,1
Good luck!,RonInDune,1
@Trissin you guys get it done or called it a night after a while?,thegoaliebear,1
still going :((( our first team broke apart,Trissin,1
now i'm with 1 guy from my original team and 4 randos,Trissin,1
damn...hope you guys get it. take breaks tho ik yall wanna get it done but make sure you're taking care of yourselves too that's a long time!,thegoaliebear,1
"haha indeed, thanks!",Trissin,1
holy crap. only 7 hours left,Trissin,1
"i know that sounds weird, _only 7 hours left_, but holy jesus this raid is SO HARD",Trissin,1
the final boss is actually ridiculous,Trissin,1
you guys can do it!,thegoaliebear,1
"ty!! our group is just chilling right now, one of them is at starbucks",Trissin,1
that's good. hoping yall get through it aha. it has been a looong time lol.,thegoaliebear,1
it has haha,Trissin,1
Good luck Trissin. I believe dude,Oathbreaker,1
Am I insane or did they change how orbs of light look?,Arixama,1
they look like the solstice orbs just not elemental colored lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Like theyve got like a weird tinge of darkness around the edge sometimes, right?",Arixama,1
Post a picture,Oathbreaker,1
i'm so nervous... only like 4 hours left,Trissin,1
"@Trissin you're at final, right?",Thawxtem,1
we've been at final FOREVER,Trissin,1
do you mind if... I biggyback and get the checkpoint for my group?,Thawxtem,1
don't stress. you can do it🔥,thegoaliebear,1
haven't finished encounter 1 yet,Thawxtem,1
we got to the final boss when only like 2 or 3 people had it cleared!,Trissin,1
@Thawxtem do you guys have the mechanics of the first encounter down?,thegoaliebear,1
we understand them but werent able to complete it,Buttkikker,1
"yes, just trial and error with very low light",Thawxtem,1
the sandbox challenge is pretty rough,Trissin,1
"people have to be on top of ads, or else those acolytes with the boomers will MELT your team",Trissin,1
"the large ogres as well, they have to go down immediately",Trissin,1
"I think the main difficulty in the final encounter is really just sandbox challenge, the knights can kill you in like half a second",Trissin,1
yeah being underleveled is the worst part. you can understand everything but if you just die to adds so easily it.makes it unnecessarily frustrating,thegoaliebear,1
"The group I was with had the mechanics down perfectly, and everybody knew what they had to do and what needed to be done",Trissin,1
We just couldn't execute it,Trissin,1
I've played with SO many people in the last 15 ish hours,Trissin,1
haha i can imagine. that was how we were with Last Wish. we had a lot of trouble at riven with execution even tho we knew exactly what to do. but eventually everything just clicks and you get it done.,thegoaliebear,1
you just need the ONE run of it😜🔥,thegoaliebear,1
Is DIM broken for anyone else right now?,RonInDune,1
I just logged in for teh first time since Monday and everything is either super slow or not loading at all,RonInDune,1
I do not like the location of the pursuits tab,Arixama,1
I fucking hate it. Goof ball move by bungie.,Matos,1
I dno't understand it at all,RonInDune,1
"Like,the seperate tab is great. Should be in the character/inventory, not director",Arixama,1
Difficult to get to,RonInDune,1
Difficult to parse information,RonInDune,1
I'm itching to get home now,Oathbreaker,1
Someone already has Revoker,Oathbreaker,1
"It's so weird, Bungie usually has great UI/UX",RonInDune,1
And it looks absolutely disgusting in the best of terms,Oathbreaker,1
Oh yeah a youtuber has it,RonInDune,1
I sawa  recommended video,RonInDune,1
CammyCakes used it with a Fusion rifle and still did well,Oathbreaker,1
Granted that's Cammy,Oathbreaker,1
But Jesus I want it,Oathbreaker,1
With a fusion?,RonInDune,1
But you wouldn't have ammo,RonInDune,1
Loaded Question,Oathbreaker,1
2x fusion finder for the fusion,Oathbreaker,1
And if he missed a snipe then for the most part it would get refunded,Oathbreaker,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
You could do some stupid shit like Revoker Jotunn honestly,Oathbreaker,1
Or Revoker/Shotgun,Oathbreaker,1
"And as an additional statement: Fuck it, I'm gonna try and get NF this season",Oathbreaker,1
May cost me my sanity getting to Legend,Oathbreaker,1
But I have held that gun as my endgame goal for months,Oathbreaker,1
"Considering how effecting the mountaintop seems to be in PvE, I might focus on that and recluse this season",RonInDune,1
Mountaintop is also something that I want to finish off,Oathbreaker,1
Recluse will be stupid good as usual,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah most teams just used mountaintop for boss dps in the raid and absolutely dumpstered everything,RonInDune,1
weird,RonInDune,1
Because it's really good honestly,Oathbreaker,1
It's just a grind slower than the slowest boat to China in the 1700s or some other comparable century,Oathbreaker,1
I feel like if I could survive redrix without going insane I might be able to do mountaintop,RonInDune,1
It's a lot of grenade launcher stuff,Arixama,1
"Well I'm working on the prospector catalyst, might kill two birds with one stone",RonInDune,1
Niice,Arixama,1
did you guys get it @Trissin,thegoaliebear,1
no :((((((((,Trissin,1
im so sad,Trissin,1
"aww sorry 😦 well, you made it further than like...most people in the world haha. i'm sure you'll finish it this week tho.",thegoaliebear,1
haha maybe,Trissin,1
"I don't want to sound like an ass or anything, but i 100% think that the day one completion is not terribly difficult. What made it hard was people playing aggressively, and not being used to being underlevelled",Trissin,1
"However, because it's so easy to slip up, make a small mistake, and die, that causes teammates to have to cover - and then the team structure collapses and nobody is able to complete their responsibilities",Trissin,1
at least that's what I've noticed,Trissin,1
a lot of people play too aggressively with shotguns and SMG's when they should be playing more passively for their life,Trissin,1
"oh definitely. pretty much all of us were running outbreak/shotgun/hammerhead last night, using our supers often, and it worked out great. there's no reason to get up close to adds when you'll literally die in two shots to like, an acolyte haha.",thegoaliebear,1
yeah  haha,Trissin,1
"i also feel like, when you're learning the mechanics or if you have the mechanics already down, it doesn't make sense to hold your super. i see people do that all the time like holding supers for dps and it's like...just use your super if you feel you might die because then the group won't even get to dps lol.",thegoaliebear,1
"and like definitely I made mistakes and bad decisions as well, but my death count was relatively low and was rarely due to a tactical mistake",Trissin,1
also i completely agree with u goal,Trissin,1
right. sometimes you just get absolutely demolished or some wacky shit happens lol...but i hate when people keep dying from things that are relatively easy to prevent...like being too aggressive when they shouldn't aha.,thegoaliebear,1
^^^^ times like a bajillion,Trissin,1
aaaahhhhhh,Trissin,1
i ran into that stuff so much when i did sherpa runs in D1 lolol.,thegoaliebear,1
hahahaha,Trissin,1
"ah well. there are a lot of players better than I am who didn't earn the emblem, and I got to play with a lot of cool people.",Trissin,1
it was a fun grind,Trissin,1
and definitely a REALLY cool raid,Trissin,1
Guys did you notice weird crystals in the xur strike?,RonInDune,1
the xur strike?,Trissin,1
They're undamageable,RonInDune,1
Yeah on Mars,RonInDune,1
what's the xur strike??,Trissin,1
The one where you kill xul,RonInDune,1
Sorry I meant xol,RonInDune,1
Too many x-names,RonInDune,1
oh yeahhh i noticed that the other day.,thegoaliebear,1
maybe you can hit them with the valkyrie ?,thegoaliebear,1
ohh what interesting,Trissin,1
I tried multiple times,RonInDune,1
didn't work,RonInDune,1
Also the valkyrie seemed to hit a ceiling right before the crystals,RonInDune,1
might just be my aim,RonInDune,1
might have to go do that strike again to see what that's all about haha.,thegoaliebear,1
seems like it could have something to do with the Rose quest or bad juju (if that gun really is coming back).,thegoaliebear,1
Oooh,RonInDune,1
Also there are lore peices scattered all around the menagerie,RonInDune,1
Are there any changes in the main Levi raid?,RonInDune,1
Oh the one eyed mask ornament looks cool and the synthoceps ornament is freaking amazing,RonInDune,1
doubt levi had any changes.,thegoaliebear,1
with a 5 minute timer after menagerie I was expecting there to be stuff haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh man the new hunter exotic is too creepy to use,RonInDune,1
"hey @thegoaliebear , spoiler for the reveal in the next ~2 hours but ||I heard there is gonna be crosssave between platforms, or something like that||",Trissin,1
@Trissin all except ps4 LOL,thegoaliebear,1
OMG WJAT,Trissin,1
haha yeah apparently Sony is being really stubborn about it.,thegoaliebear,1
"oh jk i guess they're still working with Sony and it seems PS4 will have cross save. so, that'll be nice in september to be able to save my characters onto PC.",thegoaliebear,1
HYPE,Arixama,1
Oof so much details,RonInDune,1
Raid in the ||Black Garden!!!|| New ||Finishing moves for each class!!!||,RonInDune,1
HOLY CRAP,Trissin,1
Although ||no Destiny 3 on the horizon.||,RonInDune,1
||Destiny 2: New Light will let us play the first mission from Destiny again I think. Kinda confused on that part||,RonInDune,1
Game store is up:,RonInDune,1
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1085660/Destiny_2/,RonInDune,1
Also on BungieStore:,RonInDune,1
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Buy/Shadowkeep,RonInDune,1
"seems like D3 is something they haven't decided. if they follow the three year model they've done with the last two games, it would seem like a new game is due next year. but now that they're independent, they can structure that however they want, so maybe they will just go with expansions or maybe they will keep everything we've done but put it as a fresh game.",thegoaliebear,1
That is true,RonInDune,1
"Also, they have a reminder link for transfering our characters from Battle.net to steam:",RonInDune,1
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove,RonInDune,1
Sad that my seemingly chill raid group got super toxic (screaming at everyone but themselves) an hour before time was up,Thawxtem,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1
I am so sorry,RonInDune,1
"on Crown, like before the 24 hr mark?",Trissin,1
Yeah we were on the third encounter,Buttkikker,1
ah 😦 that sucks to hear,Trissin,1
I'm so fucking hyped for Shadowkeep,Oathbreaker,1
just pre ordered the deluxe,Buttkikker,1
The only thing that I'm remotely worried about will be the F2P maybe allowing for some hackers and other individuals who will make PvP unfun,Oathbreaker,1
Ooh I wanted to wait till it was clear about the platforms and such,RonInDune,1
^^ Yeah I agree with Oath there,RonInDune,1
I know how weird CS GO got right after the free to play went live,RonInDune,1
I might do the stupid thing for once and pre-order the collector's edition,Oathbreaker,1
Go for it! The collectibles look sick!,RonInDune,1
I'm gunna do it,Arixama,1
"Not gonna lie, haven't really been following the reveal. What's cool/significant?",Trissin,1
moons back,Buttkikker,1
Moon's haunted,RonInDune,1
"Oh yeah, I saw that in the director lol",Trissin,1
Th ViDoc is fairly informative too,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune part of me thinks you won't have to pay for each platform. it will likely link everything through your bungie account and you already have Destiny liscence on your PC.,thegoaliebear,1
True True,RonInDune,1
only thing would be Stadia most likely since it's new. you would have to get the liscence on that again.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah but I'm not sure a FPS would work very well on stadia. AssCreed Odyssey was excellent on it but that doesn't really need that much accuracy...,RonInDune,1
"Counterpoint, I have been playing d2 remotely since March(?)",Arixama,1
Oh yeah I forgot about that,RonInDune,1
yeah I'm not getting stadia lol. i really wouldn't have a use for it.,thegoaliebear,1
Oooh they're bringing back ||Discipline/intellect/Strength||,RonInDune,1
what's that?,Buttkikker,1
Stats from d1,Arixama,1
Also apparently in the crucible ||Sturm will one tap people||,RonInDune,1
dang,Buttkikker,1
I heard Sturm and Drang were getting a boost,Thawxtem,1
"Just looked at a page for pre-ordering the next Destiny; for PC, is it only going to be available through Steam? Will we be unable to purchase it and use the Blizzard launcher?",Thawxtem,1
Yeah it's leaving the Blizzard launcher completely,RonInDune,1
But they'll help us transfer,RonInDune,1
"I don’t have steam, though...",Thawxtem,1
"I think you might have to get steam, but creating an account is free",RonInDune,1
"So except buying Destiny, I won’t have to spend more money?",Thawxtem,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
"You'll only have to buy the expansion, as well.",Arixama,1
I wonder how much clans and all that are going to get hit,RonInDune,1
"Wait, does that mean two purchases? Nothing for those of us who are just being forced to switch launchers?",Thawxtem,1
You don't have to buy the stuff you already have,Arixama,1
Just the expac,Arixama,1
"Okay, that’s what I was trying to ask.",Thawxtem,1
Just wanted to make sure! 😁,Arixama,1
anyone here willing to help with t3 reckoning i need 2,Buttkikker,1
I can in a bit,RonInDune,1
Huh Destiny 2 is already one of the top sellers on Steam,RonInDune,1
loool what,Trissin,1
ok finaly got a group good enough for t3 reckoning,Buttkikker,1
Good luck!,RonInDune,1
thanks for offering though ron,Buttkikker,1
just need the chest piece,Buttkikker,1
Ah shit,Arixama,1
I was running into trash groups so I stopped,Arixama,1
we had 3 until the boss,Buttkikker,1
Finally got the full notorious invader set,Buttkikker,1
loool what the heck haha,Trissin,1
I went through like five groups that couldn't make it past bridge,Arixama,1
Yeah I end up switching from well to nova and back depending on what my group is missing,RonInDune,1
me and Nahkriin have well and orpheus rigs so we can basically 2 man,Buttkikker,1
up until boss of course,Buttkikker,1
"Yeah well, rigs and nova are essential. A titan is handy with melting point",RonInDune,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
"I found menagerie to be far, far easier than t3 reckoning",RonInDune,1
luckily there's enough shadow thralls for orpheus to still refill super despite the nerfs,Buttkikker,1
Oooh,RonInDune,1
That's perfect,RonInDune,1
I still haven't done a flawless run of oryx,RonInDune,1
"Also I haven't opened the steam front page in a while, was it always this full of weird anime pr0n games?",RonInDune,1
"No, they just recently started allowing them",Arixama,1
Dang,RonInDune,1
OH MY GOD,Arixama,1
JUST AFK DURING BRIDGE AND THEN LEAVE WHEN WE FAIL,Arixama,1
THATS COOL,Arixama,1
😭😭😭,Arixama,1
Ooof,RonInDune,1
report them,RonInDune,1
@Arixama me and Nahkriin can help after this match,Buttkikker,1
Anyone up for LW/SOTP later?,Thawxtem,1
im down for either,Buttkikker,1
I'm down,RonInDune,1
Nahkriin would also join us if thats ok,Buttkikker,1
I approved him,RonInDune,1
still need threat level so badly,Buttkikker,1
@RonInDune @Buttkikker join Raid chat,Thawxtem,1
"Yay, Trissin's back",RonInDune,1
The traitor returns...,Matos,1
aka THE TRAITOR,RonInDune,1
LOL,Trissin,1
Don’t turn it too much WHEN YOU TAKE THIS KNIFE OUTTA MY BACK,Matos,1
hahahaha,Trissin,1
"Alright Trissin, when you carrying the rest of us through the new raid?",Arixama,1
Lol when people are free and want to!,Trissin,1
Do we have enough people to try another raid tonight?,RonInDune,1
"Maybe Last Wish? Or if we're feeling brave, Crown?",RonInDune,1
currently i cant even get into the game but id be down to do a raid if blizzard starts working,Buttkikker,1
"Same issue, I can't log in either.",Trissin,1
i would be up for last wish if blizzard servers go back up,Nahkriin,1
Oh is there maintenance?,RonInDune,1
can't wait for the steam transfer...,Buttkikker,1
lol,Trissin,1
they are having issues with authentication servers,Nahkriin,1
"Huh, maybe Activision is getting back at them after all the shade in the ViDoc",RonInDune,1
I won't be on until tomorrow,Arixama,1
I won't be on for the next few days while I recover from the flight home tomorrow,Oathbreaker,1
I really hope they get these outages resolved before reset,Arixama,1
actually just got in like 15 seconds ago,Buttkikker,1
Awesome,Arixama,1
"Any idea when you might be feeling ready @Oathbreaker ? I think you'll like Crown, it's a lot of fun",Trissin,1
We should clear it as a clan,Trissin,1
Yes! I'll probably be 720-ish by then so it'll be slightly easier,RonInDune,1
I'd love to get an attempt in tomorrow if possible.,Arixama,1
No clue. Would love to maybe try it blind,Oathbreaker,1
"That being said, if there's no blind groups that I can find I'll just read up on mechanics and whatnot and then do a run with you guys",Oathbreaker,1
"Blind is fun, definitely see if you can find a group for that! If not, don't worry too much about reading up on mechanics and whatnot, it's not too complex and I think we can work it out",Trissin,1
We talking eow not too complex? Or more complex than that?,Arixama,1
"More complex than eow, but not by too much I think. Really the mechanics aren't hard to understand at all, it's the execution that's challenging",Trissin,1
I think people already one phased the final boss,RonInDune,1
"There are a lot of things that could go wrong, and it gets hard to recover after people make mistakes",Trissin,1
Haha gladd one phased within the first 24 using mountaintop yeah,Trissin,1
Oof,RonInDune,1
I believe yesterday he tried to 2 man it LOL,Trissin,1
*oof*,RonInDune,1
I've heard swords are really good?,Arixama,1
"There is a strategy, for one of the encounters, for which swords can be really effective, yes",Trissin,1
Surprisingly effective lol,Trissin,1
"Contest mode is over now, right?",RonInDune,1
Yeah,Arixama,1
So what are the actual power levels required?,RonInDune,1
"Enemies are 715, 725, and 735 I believe",Trissin,1
I know the raid itself says 740 recommended,Arixama,1
"For the last encounter, I think as long as you are 725+ you'll be fine",Trissin,1
Ah that's doable. Are you past 635 already Trissin?,RonInDune,1
"No, not quite yet because I've been switching between characters",Trissin,1
Oh,RonInDune,1
"My titan is 729, hunter is 728, warlock is only 716 lol",Trissin,1
If nothing else I'd love to do 3 high score nightfalls for all 3 characters tonight,RonInDune,1
I'm at 725 without any raid stuff,Arixama,1
Gat dang,RonInDune,1
Remember shattered throne is also powerful gear,Arixama,1
"Entering the raid around 715 should be fine, but the last encounter might be a bit hard",Trissin,1
"i'm dragging my ass, my titan is 702. had a very busy week. this weekend i will be doing some milestones",Matos,1
is anybody lower level? just joined the clan and getting back into the game after a long time,Jaclyn,1
i actually just got the game on PC a couple weeks ago. used the spark thing for my hunter but have fresh titan and warlock.,thegoaliebear,1
i play a bit sparingly on pc tho since ps4 is my main platform still. but if you see me on feel free to join up. running through the stuff with someone else is always better aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I have a level 26 hunter. Debating on if I should just finish leveling it or not. Forgot how far behind I am on pc,Jaclyn,1
okay cool thanks!,Jaclyn,1
"cool. my hunter is like level 32, so i can run through whatever you need for your hunter. i need more gear lol.",thegoaliebear,1
nice sounds good!,Jaclyn,1
I think I'm just going to finish up leveling my hunter and then use my boost on a warlock since on ps4 I had a titan,Jaclyn,1
Welp apparently Gigz has already two manned Gahlran,RonInDune,1
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dm3DGy4jmfY||,RonInDune,1

Has anyone found a map of the menagerie? I want to go lore hunting but I get lost constantly,RonInDune,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/bwtgjt/secrets_within_the_menagerie/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,Arixama,1
"Not a map, but current known lore locations",Arixama,1
"Yeah I just can't seem to find the one in the gauntlet, I have the other 4",RonInDune,1
Its off to the side kind of behind one of the pillars,Arixama,1
Do we have enough people to do a cos attempt tonight?,Arixama,1
Is @Oathbreaker gonna be ready?,Trissin,1
Nope lol,Oathbreaker,1
Sitting in JFK right now and will be for another 4 hours,Oathbreaker,1
"And then add on an hour and a bit flight, with an hour drive home, so basically midnight tonight",Oathbreaker,1
Haven't even touched any content so I'm still 700,Oathbreaker,1
Maybe Monday night?,Oathbreaker,1
I'll be honest I want to do a blind run first but I don't think I'll be able to find a group by then,Oathbreaker,1
We might attempt a Last Wihs then?,RonInDune,1
I'm good for Last Wish,Trissin,1
Maybe try for a Petra's,RonInDune,1
Yeah flight got delayed again so definitely not gonna be ready,Oathbreaker,1
So apparently the best way to get the pinacle grenade launcher is to quue into a strike with a 3 person fireteam and then farm lost sectors for 4 hours,RonInDune,1
"yeah, did you see ehroar's videos on it?",Trissin,1
That sounds...fun?,Matos,1
it's actually really strong,Trissin,1
I read reddit comments summarising it,RonInDune,1
also **Hush!!**,Trissin,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
SO GOOD,Trissin,1
i want it,Trissin,1
Oh man it's such a long grind for hush though,RonInDune,1
I'm already exhuasted,RonInDune,1
"Best way to get wendigo is get a three man fireteam, get corrupted, and run blind wells.",Arixama,1
ohhhhh interesting,Trissin,1
Now that's agood tip,RonInDune,1
So is anyone here close to getting the hush yet? I'm betting @Matos would be the first,RonInDune,1
Negative. Bows suck.,Matos,1
My one bow with dragonfly/explosive head is ... passable,RonInDune,1
Crazy idea.,Matos,1
Get rid of bows and buff scout rifles.,Matos,1
I vote for that idea,RonInDune,1
Is there still a raid happening tonight I can join?,Thawxtem,1
We have some people online but it feels like it's a bit too late,RonInDune,1
I'm happy to join if we've got the people,Trissin,1
I'm actually fucking pissed,Oathbreaker,1
Plane got delayed 3 times,Oathbreaker,1
Finally board only to have the pilot max out his hours,Oathbreaker,1
Dang dude that sucks,RonInDune,1
Sorry to hear that.,Thawxtem,1
So basically I'm stuck in JFK with the option of waiting for a pilot which is unlikely or I find a hotel room and rebook a flight that might have room which is just as unlikely,Oathbreaker,1
flying is like the worst experience,Buttkikker,1
This is by far the worst flight experience I've ever had.,Oathbreaker,1
"Not at all the fault of the people involved, still fucking pissed.",Oathbreaker,1
"Still stuck here lmao. Slept overnight in the terminal so we could get onto a 7:15am replacement flight. Well, 7:15 has come and gone, no plane has shown up.",Oathbreaker,1
14+ hours now.,Oathbreaker,1
"16 hours, both flights cancelled. I just want to get back to fucking Toronto. Hell, just find me a fucking way over the stupid fucking border I don't care. I'm pissed off now.",Oathbreaker,1
I’m in Toronto!,Matos,1
Are you stopping over?!,Matos,1
Let’s hang out!,Matos,1
I’ll feed you.,Matos,1
In exchange for pvp lessons.,Matos,1
I'm not in Toronto,Oathbreaker,1
I'm in JFK,Oathbreaker,1
Been stuck here for 16 hours,Oathbreaker,1
If I was in Toronto I'd be so much happier right now lmao,Oathbreaker,1
Ah shit. I was just waking up and saw Toronto pop up on my phone.,Matos,1
Hahaha all good,Oathbreaker,1
The Xbox game pass pc beta has started up for $1 a month til it actually launches. Master chief collection is a part of the beta.,Arixama,1
"Oathbreaker, I sincerely hope things get better for you today.",Thawxtem,1
yeah good luck man hope things start to go your way soon,Buttkikker,1
"Oh my god, that sounds like a nightmare!! Hope it gets worked out soon Oath.",Trissin,1
"Yeah, it's been ridiculous. I just want to go home",Oathbreaker,1
What airline are you flying with?,Trissin,1
Delta. We grabbed a flight with air Canada now,Oathbreaker,1
"Ok, good to hear. Keep us updated!",Trissin,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/byk7gz/not_sure_if_this_has_been_mentioned_before_but/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,Arixama,1
Everybodies been talking shit about my sword. 😂😂,Arixama,1
"Swords OP, please nerf",RonInDune,1
lool,Trissin,1
ooooof,Buttkikker,1
Glad your nightmare is almost over Oath,RonInDune,1
Hey @Arixama,Matos,1
You know what’s great about swords?,Matos,1
"Everything. They look dope as fuck, let you be a shield titan without having to pop a super, give you a third person view without having to emote in pvp, and can three shot a good chunk of bosses.",Arixama,1
...I’m sorry the answer we were looking for is nothing! 😜,Matos,1
2 and a bit hours before I get my flight home,Oathbreaker,1
Can't come soon enough,Oathbreaker,1
Also swords are bad with the exception of Black Talon,Oathbreaker,1
Black Talon is pocket Dawnblade,Oathbreaker,1
That being said to get the pocket Dawnblade you need to use a sword instead of an LMG and you give up an exotic slot,Oathbreaker,1
"I see yall talking, but you're not using swords ever, so your claims are baseless. 🤷‍♂️",Arixama,1
Oh cool Halo MCC is already showing up on the Game Pass PC app,RonInDune,1
😮 exciting!,Trissin,1
Also $1 is exceptionally cheap,RonInDune,1
"Also, wondering if anyone is interested in doing last wish today",Trissin,1
I am!,RonInDune,1
"Cool, let's see if we can get a group together",Trissin,1
"Ari, I used black Talon a while ago for a shits and giggles PvP heavy",Oathbreaker,1
Was some of the most fun shit I've used in a while,Oathbreaker,1
Go watch Bakengangsta if you want to see it taken to really god-tier levels of play,Oathbreaker,1
im down for LW,Matos,1
I'm going to bed real fucking early. Looking at maybe an hour or two of sleep in the past 40ish hours,Oathbreaker,1
"damn, that's crazy",Trissin,1
It's what happens when you gotta sleep on the floor of an airport terminal lol,Oathbreaker,1
Good news is I'll sleep like a fucking rock,Oathbreaker,1
queuing for gambit prime if anyone eants in,Matos,1
ill be able to in a bit,Buttkikker,1
Sure give me a few minutes,RonInDune,1
yeah im getting smashed in crucible,Buttkikker,1
ok im in chat,Buttkikker,1
Welp my laptop crashed,RonInDune,1
that sucks,Buttkikker,1
"I’m in for LW; also could I get a team to run shattered throne for power gear, as well as possibly COS? This could possibly be my last chance to complete within 1st week due to time restraints",Thawxtem,1
Oh sure I need to run throne as well,RonInDune,1
"So, turns out it's not difficult to one-phase Gahlran",Trissin,1
As long as people are on top of things,Trissin,1
I definitely would be down for cos,Arixama,1
Finally cracked 60000 triumph score!!!,RonInDune,1
On Canadian soil once more,Oathbreaker,1
🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦 🇨🇦,Arixama,1

:BAblobby:,Arixama,1
^ that times about 1000 is me internally right now,Oathbreaker,1
"Oath, are you Canadian?",Matos,1

Yessir,Oathbreaker,1

¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Oathbreaker,1
where are you based?,Matos,1

Hamiltoe?,Matos,1
I'm in Downtown Toronto,Matos,1

Ah okay,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah I'm over on the tip of Lake Ontario,Oathbreaker,1
Didn't realize that you were Canadian either lmao,Oathbreaker,1
i swear theres another canadian too,Arixama,1
Littlepants and I are canadian as well,Trissin,1
Pants is in toronto,Trissin,1

"oh shit, vaugh is close by",Matos,1
Thanks Ari,Thawxtem,1
get to it on the subway extension now,Matos,1
no problem,Arixama,1
This is just fueling my conspiracy theory that all Canadians know each other through some sort of hivemind,RonInDune,1
we all have our box from the Prime Minister to communicate through each other,Matos,1
its a small box. fits in the palm of your hand.,Arixama,1
called a tell a fone,Arixama,1

"It looks good, but after Halo5 I think I want to see some gameplay",RonInDune,1
But yeah the trailers so far have been quite good,RonInDune,1
I want Infinite so much,Oathbreaker,1
I also want a bed right now and a nice cold drink,Oathbreaker,1
what was wrong with halo 5?,Arixama,1
Campaign,Oathbreaker,1
Liked Elden Ring and Cyberpunk 2077 seems pretty rad as well,RonInDune,1
Hyped up to be one thing and it was something else entirely with a shitty plot in my eyes,Oathbreaker,1
Multiplayer though was pretty solid,Oathbreaker,1
"I only saw Let's Plays, but the story was dumb as heck and kinda spoiled the goodwill from Halo 4's incredible ending",RonInDune,1
i literally played through all of the halo games leading up to it and loved it.,Arixama,1
Also the Prometheans are stupid to fight.,Oathbreaker,1
"but i also love trash things, so",Arixama,1
"I mean in some respects it's an okay story, but the thing is they did those amazing Hunt the Truth campaigns, set it up to have the Master Chief go totally rogue, where he really just decided to take on a mission to track down Cortana during a period of time where it wasn't uncommon for the MC to be picking and choosing missions for himself and Blue Team to embark on",Oathbreaker,1
"Granted, they aren't Grey Team so they don't have full autonomy from the UNSC FLEETCOM but come on, the Infinity gets pissy when Chief says ""Hey I'm gonna go do a thing, last mission got done and everything is good""",Oathbreaker,1
I dunno that's just my tired as shit opinion on H5,Oathbreaker,1
It had an okay premise but just got executed poorly,Oathbreaker,1
I mean despite everything once it comes to PC I'll play the heck out of it anyway,RonInDune,1
^,Oathbreaker,1
It's going to be so weird playing an fps with no superjump or mantle.,Arixama,1
huh the nessus chests have refreshed and are set to refresh again tomorrow,RonInDune,1

id be down for starting later.,Arixama,1
"I asked for help making the group to try and start soon, but only because I feel like this is my last night to try for week 1. I just didn’t want to set a time too late. I’m willing to start whenever so long as we’re willing to try our hardest to finish",Thawxtem,1
Wait what why is ||Keanu Reeves|| in Cyberpunk 2077?,RonInDune,1
This is what I get for watching the trailer on a tiny mobile screen,RonInDune,1

Hmm that sounds too good to be true,RonInDune,1
Sneaky Canadians,RonInDune,1

Can @Matos join?,RonInDune,1
i know hes at a pretty low light,Arixama,1
Ohh yeah I forgot,RonInDune,1
Low isn't a huge deal I think,Trissin,1
Matos can handle it,Trissin,1
Yeah challenge builds character,RonInDune,1
I'm also 700 but dead tired so,Oathbreaker,1
I'm gonna bow out of that one,Oathbreaker,1
plus youd have to do the start quest,Arixama,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
That too,Oathbreaker,1
Sorry I'll be logging on soon,Trissin,1
Is Matos our 6th?,Trissin,1

"if you need help with anything in the future, let us know!",Arixama,1
For sure. When I have a better LL I’ll be up for it.,Matos,1
So can we try the raid again tonight?,RonInDune,1
I would desperately love to,Thawxtem,1
"@here sorry for the large @, but I wanted to get another team together for Crown of Sorrow for the final night before the week is up",Thawxtem,1

SO anyone down for running the 100 power deficit nightfalls for the ||Truth|| quest?,RonInDune,1
I'll be free tomorrow!,Trissin,1
How's the quest - is it long and grindy?,Trissin,1
Nah pretty short due to a bug,RonInDune,1
oh?,Trissin,1
I'm on the last step now and it took barely an hour,RonInDune,1
haha nice!,Trissin,1
you do need a fair few tinctures though,Arixama,1
True,RonInDune,1
Ari did you finish already?,RonInDune,1
"oh no, not sure how many of those I have left",Trissin,1
you can buy those right? from the ahamkara skull,Trissin,1
Eh they're cheap,RonInDune,1
yup. for 50 baryons,Arixama,1
Yeah from the right skull,RonInDune,1
"oh that's fine, got a crap ton of baryons sitting in my vault lol",Trissin,1
"i did finish it, you can just do the normal strike and a bunch of people are running it right now",Arixama,1
Ah ok that's perfect,RonInDune,1
and how does it perform ari?,Trissin,1
Huh Hawthorne gave me a service revolver with moving target/kill clip,RonInDune,1
*Chronicler* Achieved,Arixama,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1
nice,Buttkikker,1
"It's the best title, no bias whatsoever",RonInDune,1
im one taken egg from cursebreaker,Buttkikker,1
which one?,Arixama,1
From one of the ascendant planes?,RonInDune,1
no its between morgeth and the vault in lw,Buttkikker,1
but ive not done the raid yet,Buttkikker,1
Oh yeah that one,RonInDune,1
We should do last wish soon,RonInDune,1
agreed,Buttkikker,1
Plus I still haven't finished crown,RonInDune,1
You've never done last wish @Buttkikker ?? We'll do it soon,Trissin,1
Come see what all the hype is about,Trissin,1
yeah ive only done the rivin fight,Buttkikker,1
Maybe even do Riven legit,RonInDune,1
maybe snag yourself a 1KV 😉,Trissin,1
i hope,Buttkikker,1
at this point im mostly working on powerful gear but after i hit 750 ill likely go for titles and farm raids,Buttkikker,1
"i mean you've already got dredgen, that's a good one lots of people use",Trissin,1
"I don't have it, just cant push myself to get the ghost shell",Trissin,1
its probably the one ill use,Buttkikker,1
i got the ghost shell by doing daily bounties on all of my characters for like 2 weeks,Buttkikker,1
dedicated like an hour a day towards the end af the forsaken season,Buttkikker,1
I might go for it this season. I turned in like a **CRAP** ton of infamy bounties on all of my characters,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"until i get protect the runner, theres no point in going for the resets",Arixama,1
what if you get it _while_ grinding for resets? 🤔,Trissin,1
Alright I admit,Oathbreaker,1
Gambit with a proper team,Oathbreaker,1
Can be entertaining,Oathbreaker,1
@Matos,Trissin,1
I don't think fun is the right word,Oathbreaker,1
But it's something,Oathbreaker,1
"I’m here, hello?",Matos,1
Dozed off.,Matos,1
Someone say gambit?,Matos,1
just got my friend protect the runner,Buttkikker,1
Dang nice,RonInDune,1
just one game and I hate that they are making players use snipers in crucible,Thawxtem,1
Agrees,RonInDune,1
I think rumble is going to be the easiest way to farm out the sniper kills,Arixama,1
"I just want to get the bounties done, but I die almost instantly after I revive because of sniper range",Thawxtem,1
For warlock use the contraverse holds for easy one hit kills,RonInDune,1
For titan I just used the disco helmet with shoulder charge,RonInDune,1
Also I'd recommend the izanagi for some one body hit kills,RonInDune,1
"Still don't have Izanagi; besides, I'm not interested in the crucible sniper rifle, I just want to play a game where everyone Isn't using a sniper for the quest",Thawxtem,1
"Collecting the ghost stories, and I have to say that I love the Ghost Community Theater Presents",Thawxtem,1
It's so cute!,RonInDune,1
So glad I was lazy and held off on the Vanguard's quest against the Drifter; the quest just gave me the new Warlock helm,Thawxtem,1
Nice!,RonInDune,1
"Apparently it's meant for crucible, because it also has Sniper reserves",Thawxtem,1
.......,Oathbreaker,1
Everyone seems to be getting it but me,Oathbreaker,1
"It's only been a week, don't give up!",Thawxtem,1
"Feelin good about this, need better boots though",Buttkikker,1
:o is that hush?,Trissin,1
yup just got 21% last night so now i have all the gambit pinnacle weapons,Buttkikker,1
Congrats man!,Oathbreaker,1
Holy cow you really are a dredgen,RonInDune,1
:),Buttkikker,1
He impressed me with his invades and I'm not easy to impress.,Matos,1
Oh congrats @Trissin and @Thawxtem for being among the first to complete the raid!,RonInDune,1
Haha thanks @RonInDune !,Trissin,1
Our fearless leader!,Matos,1
Grateful for the compliment RonInDune!,Thawxtem,1
Just finished a gambit match where I would've gotten protect the runner by the guy died at the last second :BAsalt:,Arixama,1
Ah nice Gladd has finished a 3-man flawless for Crown already,RonInDune,1
lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
lmaoo,Trissin,1
i mean what else do they possibly have to do with their time right? lol.,thegoaliebear,1
lol,Trissin,1
Can we try for a clan attempt again this weekend?,RonInDune,1
Absolutely,Trissin,1
I cant,Arixama,1
No can do for me,Oathbreaker,1
Not saturday,Thawxtem,1
Just learned that Xur has Queenbreaker,Thawxtem,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1

i'M DOWN FOR SURE,RonInDune,1
sweet,Buttkikker,1
Oh no caps lock,RonInDune,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
"Happens when playing Destiny; I'd go for LW, just set up a time",Thawxtem,1
I need to finish up two games of reckoning before then for my bounty,RonInDune,1
it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks right now,Buttkikker,1
just got mine done,Buttkikker,1
What are the modifiers?,RonInDune,1
blackout arc singe and the melee one,Buttkikker,1
oh no,RonInDune,1
the knight bosses are op with blackout,Buttkikker,1
Yeah they kill you through well,RonInDune,1
A titan is verrry handy there with bubble,RonInDune,1
"Also Rumble is very ""fun"" right now",RonInDune,1
Loaded into 3 matches with a combined total of 4 players not botting,RonInDune,1
Ok i don't have anything else to do tonight  so im down for lw whenever,Buttkikker,1
Sounds like I should be playing Rumble for MT progress,Oathbreaker,1
Oh yeah I went from 6 to 12% in a jiffy,RonInDune,1
"Yeah Oath it's ridiculous in rumble right now, I went from 6% to 33% just by playing 10 rumble games, that too using just fighting lion",RonInDune,1
"holy crap, only just learning now how crazy it is to have 6 wells in a single fireteam",Trissin,1
"litearlly infinite wells, and you can drop so many wells that your framerate drops to like 20",Trissin,1
Yeah there was a video where people took down public event bosses using nothing but well damage,RonInDune,1
It's pretty goofy,RonInDune,1
Finally checked out the menagerie. Not bad.,Matos,1
But I think I'm switching to my Hunter this week.,Matos,1
menagerie is very fun.,thegoaliebear,1
So apparently one can two person the Gahlran  deception phase by shooting colony grenades over the walls.,RonInDune,1
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlRB50c4xgg||,RonInDune,1
lol that's wild.,thegoaliebear,1
omg hahah,Trissin,1
just like when you stand under Gahlran so he can't hit you with his Jotunn seekers lol.,thegoaliebear,1
this raid is full of surprises😂,thegoaliebear,1
grenade launchers seem really screwed up in cos,Buttkikker,1
they're just really strong right now,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
like whatever that anarchy thing was,Buttkikker,1
Isn't there a skip in the menageries using grenade launchers,RonInDune,1
i feel like they didn't intend for GLs to become this strong but i will not oppose it at all.,thegoaliebear,1
i think anarchy is just weird in general,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
it breaks a lot of things,Trissin,1
Yeah they buffed fusions so alls right with the world,RonInDune,1
btw does anyone have wendigo yet?,Buttkikker,1
"Not even close, sadly. 

If anyone wants to spend a few hours grinding for it, then we can load into a normal strike and then do lost sectors or blind wells over and over again",RonInDune,1
im working on it currently if you want to join,Buttkikker,1
"oh yeah, I need to farm for wendigo as well",Trissin,1
mind if I join @RonInDune @Buttkikker ?,Trissin,1
sure,Buttkikker,1
I'll finish up this crucible and join in,RonInDune,1
sounds good,Buttkikker,1
I'll be chilling in the voice channel,Trissin,1
"@Trissin if yall are doing wendigo, you should try and get corrupted and then run blind wells",Arixama,1
"Oh yeah, we talked about it but we decided to do lost sectors instead because we think its faster",Trissin,1
Anybody free for a Nightfall?,Samakain,1
Sure!,Trissin,1
awesome!,Samakain,1
i am,Matos,1
can we make it a 100K run?,Matos,1
hey is anyone able to help me and nahkriin,Buttkikker,1
were on levi and need to get him some seals but we cant do the castellem duo,Buttkikker,1
we should only need to do it the once,Buttkikker,1
possible twice if resetting the checkpoint works to get more of the seals,Buttkikker,1
"Oh oops I didn't see the message, do you still need help with Levi?",RonInDune,1
yes please,Buttkikker,1
alright I'll join up,RonInDune,1
welp my game crashed,RonInDune,1
dang,Buttkikker,1
If you're doing this tomorrow I'll join in again,RonInDune,1
I think I'm done for the night,RonInDune,1
ok,Buttkikker,1
Sorry!,RonInDune,1
thanks for the help though,Buttkikker,1
Yeah you really need 4 people to do it easily,RonInDune,1
"oh, i remember doing this a long time ago! @Buttkikker the way I two-manned castellum over and over again was with roaming supers, maybe that will help for u as well",Trissin,1
"I went around the room and bursted down the majors with melting point and full-auto shotguns, my friend defended with arcstrider/tether/other ad-control supers",Trissin,1
huckleberry is good for this,Trissin,1
Gratz on 750 @RonInDune,Arixama,1
Thank you!,RonInDune,1
I'll have it Tuesday if I don't have it before. 🎉,Arixama,1
Yeah the targeted upgrades from Black armoy and the menagerie is so useful,RonInDune,1
"My titan is 749, just needs a arm piece",RonInDune,1
agreed i should have saved managerie,Buttkikker,1
I'm 3 armor pieces short and that's it,Arixama,1
missing a bond for 750,Buttkikker,1
Well you''ll get it on Tuesday for sure then,RonInDune,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
"My first 50 defeat game, holy shit",Oathbreaker,1
Jesus christ oath,RonInDune,1
That is amazing,RonInDune,1
"Le Monarque! 2 down, 1 to go!",Thawxtem,1
Yay!,RonInDune,1
It's such a cool bow,RonInDune,1
What's a good titan loadout for reckoning tier 3? For the dark knight section,RonInDune,1
Does bubble with helm of saint 15 work well?,RonInDune,1
Well of Radiance.,thegoaliebear,1
and Tethers. or two Arcstriders since it's arc singe this week - they'll destroy the knights especially if they're in the Well.,thegoaliebear,1
"Top tree hammer titan I think. Give you melting point, so you can give an extra damage buff.",Arixama,1
you only need one tho. too many titans is unnecessary💀😂 hate to say it.,thegoaliebear,1
"He was specifically asking for a titan loadout though, cause I assume he's working on his powerful gear for that character",Arixama,1
oof.,thegoaliebear,1
i love my titan. but he'll be my neglected character this time😭,thegoaliebear,1
Thanks Ari that's what I'll go with then,RonInDune,1
"Ron, when in doubt about Titans...melting point.",Matos,1
There is very little content if there is any where something else will be better than melting point.,Matos,1
mid path arc could work this week,Buttkikker,1
the super is fast and hurts both,Buttkikker,1
"Funny thing about melting point, I can one shot spectral blades in the crucible if I have my peregrine greaves boots on",RonInDune,1
but i dont play much titan so not experienced,Buttkikker,1
Those boots will one shot any super except for blocking middle tree arcstrider but ONLY IF THEY ARE FACING YOU,Oathbreaker,1
"Basically it's a pocket ""Fuck you"" for any and all supers",Oathbreaker,1
Wait really? Even shield titans?,RonInDune,1
I believe so,Oathbreaker,1
Dang I should use it more then,RonInDune,1
I gotta knock out a bunch of milestones tonight is anyone is around and has some to do on an alt and wants company.,Matos,1
Yeah sure I have to work on my hunter anyway,RonInDune,1
I should've had my buddy do a gambit match with you @Matos he's an invader out of necessity as well.,Arixama,1
I'm always down for Gambit.,Matos,1
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arixama1187,Arixama,1
Friend me up,Arixama,1
"Guys if you want the Raid jacket for completing it in the first week, today's the last chance",RonInDune,1
Oh right we will be in steam eventually.,Matos,1
"Yup, in just a couple months.",Arixama,1
I'll add you when I get in my PC.,Matos,1
"So apparently ||data miners found a model for Touch of Malice within D2.|| I didn't know you could actually ||data mine gun models, just perks/lore/etc.||",RonInDune,1
just hit 750,Buttkikker,1
Nice!!!,RonInDune,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
got a bond from leveling up my glory,Buttkikker,1
ty,Buttkikker,1
Are you fabled already?,RonInDune,1
no,Buttkikker,1
im like brave 2 or somthing,Buttkikker,1
"Ah I'm the same, close to hitting my ceiling",RonInDune,1
What's the meta like now? I don't see that many spectrals anymore,RonInDune,1
im using fighting lion for mountaintop and just getting lucky with wins,Buttkikker,1
In comp?!? Damn dude,RonInDune,1
as long as i keep getting all the power ammo i can never lose,Buttkikker,1
lel,Buttkikker,1
True true,RonInDune,1
I'm still slowly farming bots in rumble,RonInDune,1
ah,Buttkikker,1
its fairly easy in low glory ranks,Buttkikker,1
Are you trying for the sniper?,RonInDune,1
kinda,Buttkikker,1
if i get it on the way then thats nice,Buttkikker,1
but i do have all the sniper kills/headshots,Buttkikker,1
Oh woah,RonInDune,1
did that in regular,Buttkikker,1
So you almost have all the pinnacles for this season already,RonInDune,1
yup,Buttkikker,1
Finally getting back on tonight,Trissin,1
Nice!,RonInDune,1
Also I'm 750 on 2 chars now!,RonInDune,1
wow nice,Buttkikker,1
After next week's milestones I should be good for crown of sorrow.,Matos,1
Nearly had another 50 bomb tonight,Oathbreaker,1
Lord of Bullshit is dumb as hell,Oathbreaker,1
dam,Buttkikker,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
I play PvP way too much,Oathbreaker,1
Do you have the sniper?,RonInDune,1
"Nah, haven't played comp yet",Oathbreaker,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
Been having a fun time in QP,Oathbreaker,1
Well since you haven't calibrated yet I wouldn't mind tagging along for a couple of games lol,RonInDune,1
Really would like recluse this season,RonInDune,1
It'll still pull my general MMR unfortunately,Oathbreaker,1
im going to try for mountaintop this season,Buttkikker,1
Ohhh,RonInDune,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
If I can help people from the clan though I will,Oathbreaker,1
Wonder if I can get recluse just by the weekly bonus,RonInDune,1
Absolutely can,Oathbreaker,1
3 games a week with 1 win minimum,Oathbreaker,1
It'll take the whole season but,Oathbreaker,1
That's good enough!,RonInDune,1
I win about 1 in 3 anyway,RonInDune,1
I might just most of mountaintop done in rumble honestly,RonInDune,1
If anyone wants crucible tips though I'm happy to help,Oathbreaker,1
I'm getting 5% a match just by killing bots,RonInDune,1
im down to just the multikills like 81% done or somthing,Buttkikker,1
Woah,RonInDune,1
comp gives 4x medal progress and 2.5x multikill progress,Buttkikker,1
Ohh,RonInDune,1
"Also it's Iron Banner next week, with bonus progress as well",RonInDune,1
i cannot use grenade launchers in crucible for my life,Trissin,1
"dunno why, they just really dont work for me",Trissin,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
i'll wait for mayhem,Trissin,1
they arent great fighting lion takes 2 shots to kill,Buttkikker,1
I'm slowly starting to grok fighting lion,RonInDune,1
Mostly do one burst with something then finish up with lion,RonInDune,1
Did lord of wolves get buffed?,RonInDune,1
Um.... Indirectly? You can activate the 10-shot for free now which gives bonus damage,Oathbreaker,1
You can map people,Oathbreaker,1
Uh so that's why crucible's a bit weird now,RonInDune,1
so many god damn grenade launchers all of a sudden in every playlist,Matos,1
yuuuuup,Arixama,1
people want to grind out mountaintop now,Arixama,1
"Ari, want to work on some milestones?",Matos,1
sure,Arixama,1
hop in chat,Matos,1
you guys mind if i join?,Buttkikker,1
We mind greatly,Matos,1
if you *dont*,Arixama,1
Where's Ascendant Challenge this week?,Oathbreaker,1
chamber of starlight,Trissin,1
aphileons rest,Buttkikker,1
!weekly,Arixama,1
Thanks everyone,Oathbreaker,1
What do you get from the new Iron banner quest? Armor?,Trissin,1
Yea at every step you get a powerful reward and it adds that piece to the token loot pool.,Matos,1
i think its to try and teach people how to iron banner,Arixama,1
Oh god you're right.,Matos,1
Teach people how to iron banner?,Trissin,1
What does that mean??,Trissin,1
"like the first step is defeating opponents as a team, and the second is capturing points as a team",Arixama,1
"Oh okay, that doesn't sound too bad",Trissin,1
"Except for the current state of LoW, should be fine",Trissin,1
nightfall anyone?,Pentan,1
"@me if interested, i'll be on pretty much all day",Pentan,1
i've already got card set up. two of us would make it easy,Pentan,1
i would also appreciate a sherpa for shattered throne. i played forsaken back when it came out but never got around to doing the dungeon,Pentan,1
i can join u when im done here,Trissin,1
alright. just @me when you're ready,Pentan,1
@Pentan if there's still room I'd like to do nightfall as well,Thawxtem,1
cool beans. should we wait on you @Trissin? i see you're doing raid,Pentan,1
if you guys want to start without me go ahead!,Trissin,1
thanks hun,Pentan,1
Still have to log in,Thawxtem,1
@Thawxtem i'm in voice when you're ready,Pentan,1
I just finished,Trissin,1
mind if I hop in?,Trissin,1
we're about to start,Pentan,1
warden of nothing,Pentan,1
could anyone help me open the leviathan underbelly please?,Thawxtem,1
"at the entrance, the levers should be 153246",Trissin,1
from left to right,Trissin,1
"yes, but they're resetting too fast for me",Thawxtem,1
Up your mobility. Also mida/mini ups your speed a lot,Arixama,1
all my armor went to mobility (10); warlocks just aren't fast,Thawxtem,1
it's possible youre pulling the wrong levers,Trissin,1
sometimes it's buggy if youre standing beside it and not like right in front of it,Trissin,1
like you can pull a lever from the other side if youre going fast,Trissin,1
ive had that problem before,Trissin,1
in my experince the hitboxes are odd stand right next to the lever. also you have more time than you expect,Buttkikker,1
What the heck are these eververse changes???,RonInDune,1
So they're going fully into the transmog capabilities,RonInDune,1
what?,Thawxtem,1
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/47935,RonInDune,1
"Ok this is actually a fantastic change, kudos",RonInDune,1
"I'm a fan. Sad to see the Dragonfly set I maxed for that season go, though",Thawxtem,1
Oh yeah that's true,RonInDune,1
But you don't *have* to dismantle,RonInDune,1
Kinda do. Aren't they saying the gear itself will disappear because they will be ornaments instead?,Thawxtem,1
"I don't think so, but I suspect they'll clarify that when they most more details about Armour 2.0",RonInDune,1
Cause that's be weird,RonInDune,1
I think it would mess with the game if there was an armor piece out there that WAS the ornament. I suspect it would get glitchy if the armor is kept in game.,Thawxtem,1
Yeah they might do something with that 'cause almost everyone has a leveled up eververse gear,RonInDune,1
"If I remember right, in Diablo 3 all transmog items were actual gear pieces. They might try to merge that system and the D2 armour system",RonInDune,1
Anybody want to raid tonight?,Trissin,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
what raid?,Matos,1
I'm in,Thawxtem,1
"Doesn't matter to me, whatever people need to do. Maybe you can try crown matos",Trissin,1
yea i'm about 730 now,Matos,1
"Okay, let's do crown today",Trissin,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
"Wow, that was real fast lol",Trissin,1
yup,Buttkikker,1
oof I barely got in,RonInDune,1
"to anyone who's on and bored, I never managed to get into the leviathan underbelly.",Thawxtem,1
i'll give you a hand,Trissin,1
k 1 sec,Thawxtem,1
i gotta log in,Trissin,1
@RonInDune I just realized this new Eververse deal will definitely free up vault space,Thawxtem,1
Yes!!!,RonInDune,1
That's the biggest bonus,RonInDune,1
LOL,Trissin,1
There's a sort option in DIM for source:eververse,RonInDune,1
I kinda hope it extends to future Iron Banner gear,Thawxtem,1
the new armor system and general will be great for the vault space,Arixama,1
I'm going to spend hours deleting EVERYTHING,RonInDune,1
including shaders,RonInDune,1
oh no shaders,Trissin,1
oh noooo,Trissin,1
trasmat effects too,Arixama,1
Go ahead and join up when ready,Trissin,1
Can we wait around 10 mins?,RonInDune,1
"Sure, no worries",Trissin,1
"Oh wait is 7 ,cst 8 eat?",Matos,1
Eat*,Matos,1
Eat**,Matos,1
"i believe so yeah, dont worry we sxtill have some time",Trissin,1
LOL,Trissin,1
Omg autocorrect.,Matos,1
I hate my new phone.,Matos,1
Yea I need to finish this siege match.,Matos,1
nom nom nom,Thawxtem,1
Almost ready to go @Arixama ?,Trissin,1
Ya'll need a ringer i'll be about for a few hours 😃 good hunting!,Samakain,1
Tarrabah is MINE,Thawxtem,1
anybody want to help me with the truth strike,Pentan,1
@Samakain do you mind joining a voice channel?,Trissin,1
just any voice channel is fine,Trissin,1
"Ooh, heroic menagerie next week will be pretty interesting",Trissin,1
"There's no matchmaking, so we have to enter as 6?",Trissin,1
Oh shit,Arixama,1
Well this is why we need to be 750 at a minimum!,RonInDune,1
I should be 750 next week. I'm around 740 right now.,Matos,1
Also the guardiancon stream is way too sad to watch at work damn,RonInDune,1
I'm hoping I have good internet where ever I'm staying the 30th - 10th. I'd prefer not to do lumina on my phone,Arixama,1
The true test of characters,RonInDune,1
"I should be able to hit 750 by next reset, but im too lazy to do challenges and stuff",Trissin,1
"actually, I think im 749 on my titan right now",Trissin,1
Remember you can get 3 powerful items in one menagerie run,RonInDune,1
Also can we raid again tonight?,RonInDune,1
"Sure, but I won't be home until around like 11 CT",Trissin,1
I won't be available then,Arixama,1
I'm sure you guys can organize something without me,Trissin,1
I actually won't be available at all tonight. Wasn't paying attention to time,Arixama,1
Aw,RonInDune,1
Well we'll try again this weekend!,RonInDune,1
OH MAN,Arixama,1
I'm reading the twab,Arixama,1
And their investigating cross play,Arixama,1
I have a small spark of hope!,Arixama,1
https://m.imgur.com/a/RZxmJAX,Arixama,1
that looks cool,Matos,1
Ooh those look pretty cool,RonInDune,1
Revealed them on the guardiancon stream.,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
748 and I still have mars flashpoint and nightfall to do,Matos,1
You got this!,RonInDune,1
"yea, 750 should be soon",Matos,1
oh wait,Matos,1
i still have all my menagerie to do this week,Matos,1
Then you definitely have it!,RonInDune,1
What're you missing?,Arixama,1
Mostly armor.,Matos,1
"Good thing IB armor is easier to get, and is all power gear",Thawxtem,1
I won’t be on for a few days I’m going on a trip,Buttkikker,1
Ooh exciting. Vacation time?,Arixama,1
But butt!? Who will invade for me?!,Matos,1
"I know it'll be hard, but you can just not play gambit for  a few days. 🤣",Arixama,1
>________>,Matos,1
"Trust me Matos, it's not the end of the world to not play gambit hahaha",Oathbreaker,1
Okay I'm going to need everyone to calm down.,Matos,1
Lol,Matos,1
"Just saying, I can (not) do any more raids this week. What little time I won’t be at work will either be in Iron Banner or finally watching Neon Genesis Evangelion on Netflix",Thawxtem,1
@Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47948,Trissin,1
LOL,Oathbreaker,1
NOT TOO BROKEN,Oathbreaker,1
Yikers,Matos,1
"Last thing I heard was they didn't want to crunch teams to fix it, which is why they have it slated for later",Oathbreaker,1
"but if they looked at disabling it and said ""Nah""",Oathbreaker,1
*WTF*,Oathbreaker,1
loool,Trissin,1
You can really map people with it,Oathbreaker,1
"Last thing I heard was fine, I can understand avoiding crunch",Oathbreaker,1
"Honestly I didn't have too bad a time with it, the sniper spam on every lane feels way worse",RonInDune,1
"But looking at it and going ""Let them go nuts""

Uh..... what? You patched Prometheus Lens so quickly I didn't even have a chance to play it. This is gonna be weeks where the only ways to beat them is a) Join them b) Fusions but only if you have a good roll and are good with them c) Sniping them",Oathbreaker,1
"I regularly get 14m+ kills with it, up to about 18m for consistency's sake, a shotgun that kills from that far is more than just a little dumb",Oathbreaker,1
yeah that thing is broken as hell,Pentan,1
not as bad as prometheus lens tho. crucible was just a bunch of laser tag until that was patched,Pentan,1
What exactly happened with Prometheus? Was the damage too high?,RonInDune,1
just a tad.,Trissin,1
basically the burn damage that it applied was re-applied on every tick of damage,Pentan,1
so you could apply the burn damage an insane number of times and it quite literally melted anything,Pentan,1
Ooooh,RonInDune,1
ttk was practically zero,Pentan,1
I wish I hadn't missed that!,RonInDune,1
"the funny thing was, this bug was discovered and then xur sold the gun",Trissin,1
"so it's not like only a few people had it, it was readily available to everyone",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
Dang that should be a mode of it's own,RonInDune,1
Bungie made xur sell it. So that everyone had access to it,Arixama,1
yeah i think i remember them saying that they did that so at least it would be fair until they fixed it,Pentan,1
anybody wanna go for menagerie triumphs later tonight?,Pentan,1
"Sure, i'll play some menagerie but i'm not any good lol. I've only tried it once",Trissin,1
oh it's not that hard,Pentan,1
"the mechanics are simple, mostly just dps checks that take effort",Pentan,1
"i see, just lmk when i guess",Trissin,1
cool beans,Pentan,1
"like i said, later tonight",Pentan,1
gotta go for now,Pentan,1
I won't be around until later tonight.,Matos,1
Ok I watched a video of the Prometheus lens meta and it looked absolutely hilarious,RonInDune,1
One of the best parts was the people running around with cold heart just to be different,Arixama,1
Was coldheart broken as well?,RonInDune,1
Not at all.,Arixama,1
Coldheart had a brief moment with Calus at launch. That's about it.,Matos,1
When does the void trace rifle come back again?,RonInDune,1
Wave splitter?,Arixama,1
Is that the void one?,RonInDune,1
"The one that's ps4 exclusive, yeah?",Arixama,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
So,Oathbreaker,1
According to a new video,Oathbreaker,1
It is still possible to solo Kalli without using Whisper,Oathbreaker,1
??wat??,RonInDune,1
How??,RonInDune,1
There's a joining allies spot,Oathbreaker,1
"So thanks Bungo, gonna go try this and maybe solo Kalli like I planned until school got in the way",Oathbreaker,1
Stream it!!,RonInDune,1
We'll see hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
"Gotta get the strat down, optimize gear, all that stuff. Real preliminary but that might be a tomorrow and Sunday thing.",Oathbreaker,1
Right. Gear is set I think. Real nervous about this but it's a lot easier IMO. Less factors other than just timing the spot to avoid the wipe mechanic,Oathbreaker,1
Timing window is definitely tight,Oathbreaker,1
"that took a little longer than expected, but i'm back now",Pentan,1
I'd still like to do menagerie triumphs if you're available @Trissin,Pentan,1
oh crap I just went for food,Trissin,1
Lol,Trissin,1
all good,Pentan,1
"not sure what time zone most of the clan is in, but i'm in cst and i'll be on pretty late",Pentan,1
"i'm on, just give me a shout when youre good @Pentan",Trissin,1
@Trissin playing iron banner match real quick but i'm in voice,Pentan,1
@Trissin i just got that emblem i was telling you about. the purple version of the one i had on last night,Pentan,1
"oh damn, nice. Did you hit like a higher winstreak or something?",Trissin,1
Or was it just random drop,Trissin,1
nah it's just a stupid rare drop from turning in tokens,Pentan,1
lmao what,Trissin,1
tokens,Trissin,1
ok,Trissin,1
yeah it's silly but it looks great,Pentan,1
"Oh, the Smoldering Flame emblem? Yeah, it's dumb. Low drop chance from tokens. The orange-red one is from completing ALL crucible mastery triumphs lmao.",Oathbreaker,1
yeah i saw that. pretty absurd,Pentan,1
It's for the collectors and the hardcore pvp guys,Oathbreaker,1
Low drop change from shaxx?,Arixama,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
Does it look good?,Arixama,1
I mean... yeah?,Oathbreaker,1
I like it,Oathbreaker,1
Is it exclusive to this season?,Arixama,1
"Nah, been around since like S4",Oathbreaker,1
I'll get it next season then,Arixama,1
Anybody for nightfall?,Samakain,1
Not free atm but I'll be on a bit later @Samakain,Trissin,1
"Awesome, i'll be around for a bit so let me know when you're free 😃",Samakain,1
will do 👍,Trissin,1
"i'd like to do either great hunt or the new raid soon. i haven't even touched the new raid yet, but i've definitely got the light now",Pentan,1
great hunt? is that last wish,Trissin,1
right yes it's called last wish my bad,Pentan,1
the armor is called great hunt and i confused myself,Pentan,1
"yeah, im down to do last wish and/or crown",Trissin,1
have you done scourge ?,Trissin,1
scourge? don't even know what it is,Pentan,1
"that was the raid for black armory, it's on earth",Trissin,1
oh damn,Pentan,1
"like i said, i've been gone since forsaken",Pentan,1
WE can do one today if we have people!!,RonInDune,1
^,Trissin,1
that would be swell,Pentan,1
"but of those 3, last wish is the only one i'm familiar with the mechanics of",Pentan,1
and last time i did it there were still 2 wishes that we didn't even know what they were,Pentan,1
all good lol. you'll pick it up quickly,Trissin,1
Is anyone else interested in raiding today?,Trissin,1
"(I have a riven checkpoint on my titan, would love to finish that up as well)",RonInDune,1
"absolutely, we can do that quickly",Trissin,1
does riven cheese still work? i've actually never done it legit. couldn't find a group that would,Pentan,1
"i've only done it legit a couple times myself, the cheese is still going strong",Trissin,1
https://www.cheese.com/media/img/cheese/seriouslystrongcheddar.jpg,Pentan,1
"Yeah I tried legit once, it ended badly for all concerned",RonInDune,1
I'm definately down for today post pancakes.,Samakain,1
I believe I was part of the group with RonInDune’s titan. I would be open to raids tonight as well,Thawxtem,1
"Yeah that was bit of a glitchy run, I remember butkikker going through the portal for final stand and just randomly dying",RonInDune,1
https://gyazo.com/2f66131d4f76280662bca3233ccdf4e4,Trissin,1
!!!!!,Trissin,1
Oh wooow,RonInDune,1
...carry?,Thawxtem,1
Yooo,Samakain,1
jk,Thawxtem,1
Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
"thanks!! we got the vessel bug too, so we had to do the final encounter using only 3 vessels in total",Trissin,1
also couldn't risk the deception bug on the third encounter,Trissin,1
glad it's finally done now,Trissin,1
I though you weren't going to attempt because of the bug!,RonInDune,1
I couldn't resist haha,Trissin,1
"so for raid tonight we have myself, @Trissin , @RonInDune , @Samakain and @Thawxtem",Pentan,1
worst case scenario we just lfg for one more but with that many of us ready to go i think we definitely should,Pentan,1
"actually i am not sure i'll be able to make it, sorry!!!!",Trissin,1
"I will probably be back later, but I don't know when that's going to be",Trissin,1
I'm up late so if people are down I can wait it out,RonInDune,1
"Haha thanks ron! But you should try to replace me if u can, since I don't want to make you guys wait",Trissin,1
you have our love either way,Pentan,1
"maybe like ari, matos, oath might be able to help out",Trissin,1
I'll let you guys know when I'm back,Trissin,1
Cool no worries,RonInDune,1
We can threaten matos to join by saying we'll cancel gambit if he doesn't come,RonInDune,1
i don't know matos but i'm always down for some good old fashion blackmail,Pentan,1
anyone know how to tell if I've done a raid already this week?,Thawxtem,1
go to raid.report,RonInDune,1
?,Thawxtem,1
or you can check in game to see if it still offers you powerful rewards,Pentan,1
https://raid.report/pc/4611686018475931494,RonInDune,1
"^^
raid report is our friend",Trissin,1
super helpful,Trissin,1
helpfil,Pentan,1
_shhh_,Trissin,1
hm. apparently i had a day one clear on eater of worlds,Pentan,1
wish that was an actual raid and not just a strike with shiny lasers,Pentan,1
Aw but it was super pretty at the end!,RonInDune,1
@Pentan at what time were you hoping to go to a raid?,Thawxtem,1
honestly ready whenever,Pentan,1
just as soon as we have everyone ready,Pentan,1
@RonInDune @Samakain what do you say to 1:17 from now,Pentan,1
10:00 cst,Pentan,1
Sure,RonInDune,1
Sure!,Samakain,1
which raid are we hitting btw? anything i should have on hand?,Samakain,1
i'd like to do either last wish or crown of sorrow,Pentan,1
I am currently fighting off a chest infection and already in bed. Good luck though!,Matos,1
"Oh no, get well soon matos",RonInDune,1
:ghost: dinklebot will heal you,Pentan,1
"oh my god, get well Matos!!!",Trissin,1
Get well soon Matos!,Oathbreaker,1
@RonInDune @Samakain it is time,Pentan,1
we ride,Pentan,1
Alright I'll be online in 5,RonInDune,1
just going to grab a drink.,Samakain,1
i'm still new here so i don't really know who else would be willing to help us but we do still need two more assuming trissin isn't coming,Pentan,1
Those blue runes seem rather rare,Thawxtem,1
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/49darQ2OR04/maxresdefault.jpg,Pentan,1
@RonInDune you coming love?,Pentan,1
ah yeah joinin,RonInDune,1
@PC so anyone down for a raid in a bit?,RonInDune,1
I just got off. Been a long night of scrimming some peeps so I'm real drained,Oathbreaker,1
It's all good!,RonInDune,1
"If the offer still stands, I'm down for a raid",Peronix,1
"sorry lad, we just disbanded",Pentan,1
"one of our guys had a connection issue and another had to get off for the night and get some sleep, sorry",Pentan,1
probably reconvene tomorrow @Peronix,Pentan,1
I'll be getting home soon lol,Trissin,1
"I am like on a roll, getting these knocked out",Trissin,1
What the heck,RonInDune,1
Someone get our boy a fire extinguisher.,Samakain,1
Nice mate!,Samakain,1
lol ty haha,Trissin,1
you're actually silly,Pentan,1
Perfected Chalice is now mine!,Oathbreaker,1
Oh woah nice!,RonInDune,1
"Do you have to pay for the perfected node, or just all the upgrades?",Arixama,1
just upgrades,Oathbreaker,1
"Cool, I'll have it when I get home",Arixama,1
Try for a raid group again tonight?,Pentan,1
Yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
@Pentan,Arixama,1
Oh lord what is this,Pentan,1
Click the plus,Arixama,1
"I’m actually out of the house eating dinner rn. Just put in our order, but I should make it back in time for that",Pentan,1
Time is also flexible,Arixama,1
"I can't make it sadly, good luck!",Samakain,1
"Is there a time that would work better for you today, @Samakain ?",Trissin,1
"Not really mate, i'm out for the rest of the day in about an hour. Thanks though!",Samakain,1
"Ah, alright. Next time!",Trissin,1
Just got home. I need a few minutes but I’ll be good to go soon.,Pentan,1
cool. We still need 2 more I think,Trissin,1
Hmm can we do it at around 7:30 CT? Roughly 30 mins from now?,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, that's good with me",Trissin,1
Good stuff,Pentan,1
"i'm in voice, ready whenever",Pentan,1
i'll be on within 10,Trissin,1
Alright I am ready whenever,RonInDune,1
"@RonInDune @Arixama we're getting ready, still need 2 more though",Pentan,1
My LL is to low,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
"What is your highest light? We don't have to do a new raid, maybe we can do something from year 1",Trissin,1
528,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
That high enough for a year 1 raid?,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
we think you might be able to handle last wish,Pentan,1
"Yeah, more than high enough. All the year one content is <380",Trissin,1
"^
You should be able to do last wish as well, but the final few encounters might be kinda challenging",Trissin,1
what level are you?,Arixama,1
50,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
just get in here it'll probably be fine,Pentan,1
so we've got 5 now,Pentan,1
"I’ve got to eat dinner, but I could still Raid if you still need someone then",Thawxtem,1
This time I’m off tomorrow,Thawxtem,1
Sorry Thawxterm!,RonInDune,1
We just finished,RonInDune,1
The class item drops after the third step of the ib quest! :BAblobby: :BAblobby: :BAblobby:,Arixama,1
Alright that's a really good emote though,RonInDune,1
Still stuck on that step,Thawxtem,1
It's rough,Arixama,1
Mostly it's the grenade kills that suck,Arixama,1
Mostly Pvp sucks lmao,Roymau501,1
"yeah the grenade kill step sucks, but let me send a screenshot of the NEXT step...",Pentan,1
i think they're meant to get harder and harder,Pentan,1
i can't even imagine what the last one is,Pentan,1
"Last one is just completing matches, with streaks giving the best progreas",Arixama,1
🧀,Trissin,1
85 percent grenade kills :BAblobby:,Arixama,1
I've spent a good 50 matches with the grenade step and I've just hit 30%,Peronix,1
"However, I finally completed the PvP step for Thorn and all I have left is that strike/nightfall lite so that's good",Peronix,1
"Nice!! Let me know if you need a hand with that - I don't think I'll be on tonight, but maybe sometime tomorrow",Trissin,1
I'll definitely take you up on that offer!  Tried to solo it and couldn't even get past the wards :cryJudge:,Peronix,1
Yeah I can join in for sure,RonInDune,1
"i'm actually pretty upset about the nova warp nerf. it's actually been butchered. i otherwise really like the abilities in that path but the super is practically worthless, especially in pvp. weakest pvp super in the game imo. it also doesn't help that the built in blink it's supposed to have STILL hasn't been fixed. it just straight up doesn't even activate. contraverse hold was my favorite pvp exotic and now i think i'm just gonna go back to the same old bottom path dawnblade with ophidian aspect.",Pentan,1
"like yes it needed to be nerfed, but it's been obliterated",Pentan,1
maybe i'll revisit it once the new stats come out and i can make a discipline build for just using grenades with that path,Pentan,1
yes thank you all for coming to my ted talk,Pentan,1
"It's not the worst super in the game. That goes to Tether. I've seen one good tether placement and that even still got the user killed. Middle tree voidwalker's strength comes from its neutral game. It has a 6m 1hko move that resets upon super activation and the super ending. The super is still decent, use your normal blink to get within range then do a very short charge. Don't know what's going on with the Dark Blink but I'll look at it once I get home from work tonight.",Oathbreaker,1
@Peronix I just got to that step in thorn also if you care to have me on your team,Thawxtem,1
Feel free to take my spot @Thawxtem,Trissin,1
"with all of the games IB is making me play, this might just be the season where I reset valor 3x",Thawxtem,1
"may as well go for the 5x then, for redrix",Trissin,1
any idea if the Iron Banner gear quests carry over to the next IB this season?,Thawxtem,1
yes,Trissin,1
they should,Trissin,1
What step are you on thawx?,Arixama,1
on IB?,Thawxtem,1
Yeah,Arixama,1
just picked up Non-Stop (kill with all types of rifles & swords),Thawxtem,1
at 0%,Thawxtem,1
Gross,Arixama,1
What class you running on? warlock?,Arixama,1
ya; just wondering if it would be worth the effort to start on another character as well or if everything would disappear,Thawxtem,1
"@Oathbreaker true, but i was thinking about tether and at least it can cancel supers. new nova warp loses against any other super",Pentan,1
"Handheld Supernova plus even a slight charge detonation from warp should kill some supers if I'm thinking correctly, might need to do some testing on that theory",Oathbreaker,1
"I've seen the super used pretty extensively recently, it's not meant to be a dueling super IMO. Something like Arcstrider is meant to be a dueling super, where it fights other supers. Bottom tree Striker for example is meant to be a team killer, not a dueling super. Doesn't have the damage, whereas top tree Striker has the ability to duel a little better just because of the jump slam. Go off the top rope for that guy and follow up with a light strike and that should be enough damage to kill any other super, again it's all hinging on whether my memory plus math skills are working right lol",Oathbreaker,1
@Thawxtem  I'm down.  Probably be easier than any of IB's quest steps,Peronix,1
@Pentan  a man of warlock class I see. Bottom tree dawnblade with ophidian was my entire year 1.,Arixama,1
let's keep the back to back raids going. i'd like to go for crown of sorrow today,Pentan,1
"afraid I won't be able to join tonight, sorry!",Trissin,1
but I think you can definitely get a team together,Trissin,1
No raids tonight until I finish IB,Thawxtem,1
lol finish as in finish the quest? you can keep going later in the season when IB comes back,Pentan,1
alright let's see if i can figure this out,Pentan,1
!lfg create,Pentan,1

"If you can, LFG",RonInDune,1
"give me 5, just moving some stuff",Roymau501,1
how much longer do you think you'll be? if it's only like 30 minutes it'll probably take us that long to get organized anyway,Pentan,1
@RonInDune,Pentan,1
otherwise we'll just lfg,Pentan,1
I'll try but can't promise 30,RonInDune,1
Oh that's not as bad as I thought,Arixama,1
That's horrifying,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune we decided to run menagerie once first so that's what we just finished. you any closer to being able to play?,Pentan,1

"Props again Oath, we did great today. You really nailed it getting the solo void down, we'll have the two-man argos finished soon!",Trissin,1
"I give you all the credit lol, I feel like solo void was ez pz, staying alive might have been harder",Oathbreaker,1
"haha i don't know, it's hard to say - we make a good team though, glad to have you as my partner for this",Trissin,1
Definitely glad to be running with you,Oathbreaker,1
"Think this will definitely become easier, might become a regular thing",Oathbreaker,1
Should I post that clip in general chat?,Oathbreaker,1
Lol that's up to you,Trissin,1
How was crown?,Trissin,1
couldnt finish last encounter; but we made it there.,Roymau501,1
"Oh, nice!",Trissin,1
"I think I'll be mostly free tomorrow, if anyone wants to run through it",Trissin,1
Hmm the heroic menagerie has some really easy modifiers it feels like:,RonInDune,1
"Iron is annoying I think, definitely not too bad though",Trissin,1
Anyone want to try it out today?,Trissin,1
I'm down!,RonInDune,1
Blackout with the thralls and the Knights won't be easy,RonInDune,1

The catalyst?,RonInDune,1
whoops sry,Trissin,1
I have Teawrex on the background lol,RonInDune,1
Ooh what does it do?,RonInDune,1
I think it's a buff to honed edge x4,Trissin,1
but i might be wrong,Trissin,1
"Hmm, it's good but I would have loved to have kept more than one buff for massive damage",RonInDune,1
Tomorrow: _New video from Gladd!_ **Solo Heroic Menagerie blindfolded on rock band drums**,Trissin,1

Few weeks later: *Watch Oath and Trissin Two Man Heroic Menagerie!!*,RonInDune,1
ohhh i dont know about that one haha,Trissin,1
"Equipment is still 750, right?",Arixama,1
Equipment?,Trissin,1
"Like, loot?",Trissin,1
750 at the start but the boss is 770 I think,RonInDune,1
"It scales up, yeah",Trissin,1
They get pretty tanky near the end,Trissin,1
"Like it's not dropping higher than 750 stuff even though it goes up to 770,right?",Arixama,1
Yeah I don't think we can earn anything over 750,Trissin,1
It's not like the y1 prestige raid lairs,Trissin,1
Think we'll get a buff for solstice?,Arixama,1
Maybe,Oathbreaker,1

^,Trissin,1
Steam summer sale is on! Go play the greatest FPS game of all time: Aliens: Colonial Marines,RonInDune,1
i sincerely hope thats a joke,Arixama,1
"of course he's joking, everybody knows the greatest fps out there is roblox counterstrike",Trissin,1
1v1 me on de_dust2 you noobs,RonInDune,1
I mean,Oathbreaker,1

I don't think you want to give me an AWP though,Oathbreaker,1
Just saying,Oathbreaker,1
Tactical Shield only,RonInDune,1

"oh crap, there's a triumph for completing it with 3 or fewer",Trissin,1
yup,Arixama,1
Don't quite know when I'll be online again,Oathbreaker,1
Having internet issues right now,Oathbreaker,1
Pretty sure our ISP provider router/modem combo thing is fucked once more,Oathbreaker,1
:(((,Trissin,1
who are you with?,Trissin,1
Rogers,Oathbreaker,1
ew,Trissin,1
Aka I shouldn't be surprised we're having issues but,Oathbreaker,1
They have an exclusivity contract with the area,Oathbreaker,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh no, hope it gets fixed soon",RonInDune,1
ISP monoplies are the *worst*,RonInDune,1
"Yeah these guys are godawful. Useless when it comes to helping fix issues like this. I'll give this router credit, lasted longer than every other one before it.",Oathbreaker,1
"That being said, it's been maybe just over a year.",Oathbreaker,1
hey we still doing heroic menagerie tonight?,Pentan,1
im down,Trissin,1
but we're gonna need people,Trissin,1
im down,Arixama,1
we could also do raid if people want,Trissin,1
or something else,Trissin,1
i dont mind,Trissin,1
!lfg create,Pentan,1
i'm just gonna list it as other for now until we know what we're doing,Pentan,1
or menagerie i'll list it as menagerie,Pentan,1
"Okay so just because I don't want to no give credit where it is due, the issue is actually for most of Rogers customers in Southwestern Ontario",Oathbreaker,1
alright i'm gonna be playing overwatch with a friend so just @me when/if we're gonna do anything,Pentan,1
Do you guys know a better Chalice runes gun chart than this one?,RonInDune,1
personally i'm a fan of braytech.org,Trissin,1
https://braytech.org/chalice-tool,Trissin,1
That one's great thanks!,RonInDune,1
OH MY GOD,Trissin,1
OH MY GOD NO WAY,Trissin,1
I THINK I JUST GOT MY LAST SLEEPER NODE,Trissin,1
?????,RonInDune,1
AFTER LIKE 10 MONTHS,Trissin,1
Holy cow,RonInDune,1
Goddang,RonInDune,1
Congratulations!!!!!,RonInDune,1
YAAAAASSSSSS,Trissin,1
i've been hunting this emblem since warmind release,Trissin,1
"well, not like VIGROUSLY, but like going for it in the background",Trissin,1
Ooooof finally,RonInDune,1
whenever i'm bored and have time,Trissin,1
I figured out the secret to the emblem,Trissin,1
"When i'm farming the lost sector, I usually get bored doing it like 50 times with the same loadout",Trissin,1
"so I switch it up, and today I was feeling nostalgic so I pulled out some old year 1 weapons",Trissin,1
including the polaris lance,Trissin,1
and it seems rasputin liked that,Trissin,1
lol bribing an AI never goes well,RonInDune,1
or maybe i've just been farming it for so long i've gone mad,Trissin,1
lool,Trissin,1
roko's basilisk will getcha,RonInDune,1
wait i don't understand i thought all there was to the sleeper nodes was crafting them out of the 4 thingies and then finding rasputin's corresponding music box,Pentan,1
"yeah, that's correct",Trissin,1
There are 40 unique sleeper nodes,RonInDune,1
^^,Trissin,1
And getting them all *is a pain*,RonInDune,1
oh the emblem thing is a different discussion,Pentan,1
that's what had me confused,Pentan,1
"you have to get all the sleeper nodes for sleeper stim masterwork, right?",Pentan,1
nooo not at all!,Trissin,1
holy crap that would be inhumane,Trissin,1
lmaooo,Trissin,1
lol i've been background grinding it for sleeper masterwork because i thought that's what it was lol,Pentan,1
so how do you get sleeper masterwork then?,Pentan,1
nooo tangerine you poor child,Trissin,1
yeah i know...,Pentan,1
so it doesn't really make any sense,Trissin,1
but it comes from prestige spire of stars,Trissin,1
lol aight,Pentan,1
"random drop chance on any encounter, kind of like the acrius masterwork from prestige leviathan",Trissin,1
"so when prestige EOW and SOS came out, they had to offer some sort of 'good' reward to chase outside of just 400 power level gear",Trissin,1
"so for prestige EOW it was the telesto catalyst, and for prestige SOS it's the sleeper catalyst",Trissin,1
"and tbh, the sleeper catalyst is really good",Trissin,1
what it do,Pentan,1
"it speeds up the charge time and improves ammo, I think",Trissin,1
hold on lemme check,Trissin,1
"yeah, speeds up charge time and more reserve ammo",Trissin,1
oh hell yeah,Pentan,1
i'll have to invest soon,Pentan,1
Had an amazing rumble game by the way,RonInDune,1
"we should do spire, it's a really fun raid",Trissin,1
😮 10.5 efficiency??,Trissin,1
Spire is so cool,RonInDune,1
Lol it was just me and another guy,RonInDune,1
We had a gentleman's agreement and never killed one another,RonInDune,1
Just grenade launchers,RonInDune,1
Died to my own launcher killing me,RonInDune,1
damn ron,Pentan,1
ron i'm so jealous,Trissin,1
That's what rumble is like for me,RonInDune,1
i guess i'll have to do spire for my next raid,Pentan,1
spire is so much fun,Trissin,1
that's what i keep hearing lol,Pentan,1
i'm gonna watch some black mirror and then call it a night tho,Pentan,1
hahaha sounds chill,Trissin,1
maybe let's do a spire tomorrow,Trissin,1
black mirror is anything but chill idk why i watch it,Pentan,1
black mirror is good,Trissin,1
i like it,Trissin,1
yeah sure spire tomorrow works for me,Pentan,1
"well yes i like it but ""chill"" just isn't the word i would use to describe it 😂",Pentan,1
"spire isn't too long either, maybe if we finish quickly we can do crown or smth afterwards",Trissin,1
"haha fair, maybe not 'chill'",Trissin,1
we did make it to what i believe is final encounter on spire the other night,Pentan,1
got pretty late so we called it a night,Pentan,1
"speaking of, i need to just stop typing or i'm gonna be here all night",Pentan,1
lool,Trissin,1
gn gentlemen,Pentan,1
night tangerine,Trissin,1
"Alright so I found something interesting, there's a random yellow bar vandal in the EDZ who has a massive health pool",RonInDune,1
Just a vandal and a shank hiding near the water,RonInDune,1
In the Sunken Isles,RonInDune,1
Anyone know what that's about?,RonInDune,1
😮 i haven't heard of that before!,Trissin,1
i know there was the one on nessus by the waterfall,Trissin,1
"He's not a boss, just a major",RonInDune,1
That's Randal.,Matos,1
Randal the Vandal.,Matos,1
He was in D1.,Matos,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/c5ec98/as_heroic_menagerie_allows_you_to_enter_solo_you/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,Arixama,1
"Only lore node you can't get without starting menagerie is the gauntlet one, but it's the encounter after lamplighting",Arixama,1
"Congrats on the completion Trissin, that emblem is rare as hell",Oathbreaker,1
aha thanks oath!,Trissin,1
"So, it looks like I really need to get going on upgrading my chalice. Seems you need the chalice fully completed to get the Izanagi's catalyst",Trissin,1
Anyone know of good ways to get imperials?,Trissin,1
get the triumphs!,RonInDune,1
easy 500 imperials for each,RonInDune,1
Plus some 2250 imperials from the chest on the barge on Nessus,RonInDune,1
"Otherwise, there's always AFK farming in rumble",RonInDune,1
"Right, the problem is I have no glimmer lol",Trissin,1
You get a drop every 4~6 games,RonInDune,1
Spider!,RonInDune,1
Recently when I checked he sold glimmer for dusklight shards and etheric spirals,Trissin,1
yesterday was the titan planetary mats,RonInDune,1
So I bought 80000 glimmer worth,RonInDune,1
:oooo,Trissin,1
i have like 3 alkane dust lol,Trissin,1
"Hmm, then your best bet is to wait till glimmer for shards",RonInDune,1
"I think so, yeah",Trissin,1
(or afk in rumble),RonInDune,1
"(for max chaotic evil points, afk in competitive)",RonInDune,1
Don't be that fucker.,Oathbreaker,1
Haha I don't plan to be AFK in any pvp,Trissin,1
"Rumble, fine. Competitive, I will have zero respect for that decision.",Oathbreaker,1
"I was kidding, but yeah it's infuriating",RonInDune,1
"Can't even vote to kick, which is a feature I really want",RonInDune,1
"Also, I had a 1v4 comp game last week, wonder if those were AFK-ers getting kicked at the start of the game",RonInDune,1
maybe ill like farm some strikes or something,Trissin,1
get some wendigo progress and have that chance for imperials,Trissin,1
You could just slot a single rune in your chalice and do the chest glitch,Oathbreaker,1
"do they award from playlist strikes, cause los is now a nightfall",Arixama,1
oh is lake a nightfall this week,Trissin,1
they just changed it,Arixama,1
militia's birthright would allow me to equip 3 grenade launchers at once,Trissin,1
lmaooo,Trissin,1
"Every time you use a rune and open the chest it has a chance to award imperials, and if you have one of the upgrades it refunds a single rune from your chalice",Oathbreaker,1
aw i don't have the rune refund upgrade just yet,Trissin,1
also i dont think i have a lot of runes,Trissin,1
Whaaaaat,RonInDune,1
Anyone down for grinding LoS nightfall tonight?,RonInDune,1
Really would love the birthright,RonInDune,1
yeah ill run it with ya,Trissin,1
you wanna farm for militias? thatll get you runes,Arixama,1
Perfect!,RonInDune,1
that works out really nicely,Trissin,1
Does nightfall give you runes?,RonInDune,1
I though it was only playlist activities?,RonInDune,1
"""runes in strikes, crucible and gambit"" -runefinder",Arixama,1
Oh nice,RonInDune,1
doesnt say playlist on either runefinder or wealth,Arixama,1
yeah it doesn't have to be playlist,Pentan,1
*nice*,RonInDune,1
playlist strikes is just for wendigo so you cant cheese it as hard,Arixama,1
Back from out of state,Buttkikker,1
Welcome back!,RonInDune,1
^^ Welcome back!,Trissin,1
How were your travels,Trissin,1
mostly just really long drive there and back and unpacking old stuff from the house were going to sell,Buttkikker,1
"Oh wow, I see
well glad to have you back on",Trissin,1
"Actually @RonInDune , when do you want to farm lake of shadows?",Trissin,1

"first, i'm gonna help ron get his militia's birthright",Trissin,1
Yay thanks!,RonInDune,1

Did you get it already?,RonInDune,1
"I was farming with ari earlier, I actually got 2 already haha",Trissin,1
so it's not nearly as bad as before,Trissin,1
the more you do the higher the chance now right?,Buttkikker,1
"oh, there's a drop protection on it now??",Trissin,1
on all nf loot i think,Arixama,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
dont remember when it got implemented but i remember it did,Buttkikker,1
it was like mid forsaken or so,Arixama,1
itwas before ba,Arixama,1
Just started storming pretty garsh darn hard where I’m at. Internet went out and idk when it’s coming back so I might not be able to raid for a bit.,Pentan,1
Picked up a piece of hail the size of my thumb,Pentan,1
"wow, that's crazy",Trissin,1
"never mind, storm passed",Pentan,1
i have been ressurected,Pentan,1

This was on me,Pentan,1

"you should join us @Pentan , if you get disconnected we have no problem just chilling until u get back",Trissin,1
got the triumph for mountaintop just need fabled!,Buttkikker,1
holy cow,RonInDune,1
nah the storm passed so i'm good,Pentan,1
i'm in raid chat,Pentan,1
I'll need 5 minutes,RonInDune,1
Is there room for another in whatever raid is going on?,Thawxtem,1
i think we have 6,Buttkikker,1
alright,Thawxtem,1
"in other words, you're unwanted",Pentan,1
:nkoCry:,Thawxtem,1
"if you'd like, you can have my spot thawx",Trissin,1
i don't mind backing out,Trissin,1
everybody in here is nice but trissin on a dangerously high level of positivity,Pentan,1
i might actually have to back out cause i have to be at work at 7,Arixama,1
and it s getting decently late for me,Arixama,1
😦 next time ari!,Trissin,1
"i'll be ready to go soon, give me like 10 minutes or so",Trissin,1
sounds good,Buttkikker,1
Are we doing Spire first?,RonInDune,1
whatever people want,Trissin,1
i was thinking spire and then crown,Trissin,1
I think some people here haven't done spire yet so yeah that sounds like a plan,RonInDune,1
"Ok i'm ready, we're in the voice channel @RonInDune",Trissin,1
good luck guys!,Arixama,1
thanks ari!,Trissin,1
ty!,Buttkikker,1
"@Trissin power went out, give me a few",Pentan,1
all good,Trissin,1

My screen cut black right as I sprinted up the the chest it was perfect I wish I could shadowplay 😂,Pentan,1
"Router is rebooting, takes like 5 minutes",Pentan,1

https://youtu.be/cvuTaeMLHs4?t=1156,Buttkikker,1
rip,Trissin,1
@PC would anyone be interested in doing a 3x riven farm to try and get 1k some time tomorrow evening?,Arixama,1
@Arixama were you not with us last night? a bunch of us ran last wish and spire of stars,Pentan,1
I wasn't cause I had to be at work at 7.,Arixama,1
right my bad,Pentan,1
"Nah, you chill, I was originally gunna be in that group",Arixama,1
Servers are back!,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1144349905634283521,RonInDune,1
@Pentan  WAKE UP,Arixama,1
OH SHIT,Pentan,1
TIME TO GO BOYOS,Pentan,1
Still can't sign in. I think there might be a rush on.,Samakain,1
i just started playing stardew valley for the first time too,Pentan,1
good game,Buttkikker,1
but not destiny,Buttkikker,1
so i've heard,Pentan,1
lol,Pentan,1
yeah especially with friends,Nahkriin,1
you know what a better game is? @Buttkikker,Pentan,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
fite me,Buttkikker,1
ok yeah servers must be overburdened i'm gonna continue stardew valley for just a bit,Pentan,1
1596 hours !!!1!!,RonInDune,1
Bloody hell,RonInDune,1
"yup, no afk",Pentan,1
i'm very proud of my terraria hours lol,Pentan,1
it might also be the only steam game that i have every achievement in,Pentan,1
Woah,RonInDune,1
wait is that ur hours?,Buttkikker,1
So many punched trees,Samakain,1
I don't think my entire steam inventory combined can go that high,RonInDune,1
yup that would be correct,Pentan,1
ive got 1671,Buttkikker,1
damn you,Pentan,1
f,Buttkikker,1
Bloody hell,RonInDune,1
My top games are dota and dark souls and I haven't played either of those in years,RonInDune,1
got a buddy with almost 3k hours on csgo,Pentan,1
My top is gtav with 359,Arixama,1
See that's fairly understandable,RonInDune,1
I've got 900 some active in d2 tho,Arixama,1
Can anybody actually log into Destiny?,Samakain,1
"I'm around 700 in destiny which is probably the highest ever, other than the games from before steam etc.",RonInDune,1
nice,Buttkikker,1
"Link me that, Ron",Arixama,1
I don't think anyone can sign in,RonInDune,1
@Arixama https://www.wastedondestiny.com/4_4611686018475931494,RonInDune,1
😮 i'm at 797,Trissin,1
Only at 538,Oathbreaker,1
But that's on PC alone,Oathbreaker,1
738 for me,Buttkikker,1
621,Samakain,1
"and then my top steam is gtav at 527, but a **lot** of that is loading screens/afk/other garbage",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
lol top steam for me is Civ5 at 768. Man that's a lot of spearmen.,Samakain,1
so many spearmen,Pentan,1
"makes me really appreciate destiny loading screens, you can still play with your inventory, look at pursuits and map, do other stuff",Trissin,1
yes destiny definitely does loading screens the best,Pentan,1
Yeah that's a killer feature of D2,RonInDune,1
oh man look at those old d1 emblems,Trissin,1
What were those emblems for? do you remember?,RonInDune,1
i know the osiris one was for going flawless,Pentan,1
"Yep, Trials Flawless emblem",Oathbreaker,1
the 3rd one was something to do with prison of elders,Pentan,1
House of Judgement emblem,Oathbreaker,1
i think it was ranking up Variks?,Oathbreaker,1
Looks something like that,Trissin,1
Other one was a House of Wolves emblem relating to Skolas,Oathbreaker,1
I miss D1,Oathbreaker,1
Had some real good shit,Oathbreaker,1
yeah i know a lot of people say this but it would be so nice if they just release a dlc that had all the old raids,Pentan,1
"I never played it, but I keep thinking i should. No idea how well that'd actually turn out.",Samakain,1
i'll join you sam,Trissin,1
lets go play d1,Trissin,1
It's a step backwards in some aspects but a step forward,Oathbreaker,1
You guys on PS or XB for that?,Oathbreaker,1
im on ps,Trissin,1
"Ah, damn",Oathbreaker,1
"wait, that would mean i gotta go buy ps+ again",Trissin,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
PS+ is a killer.,Samakain,1
Fuck I miss my Lord High Fixer..... Luna's looks similar but like.... LHF was SO GOOD. Sureshot/Outlaw/Rifled Barrel/Luck in the Chamber,Oathbreaker,1
I miss this guy,Trissin,1
Hung Jury too,Oathbreaker,1
fatebringer,Trissin,1
chaos dogma,Trissin,1
Longbow Synthesis,Oathbreaker,1
Matador,Oathbreaker,1
Saladin's Vigil,Oathbreaker,1
can we have all these weapons back pls bungo,Trissin,1
Treads Upon Stars,Oathbreaker,1
"^^
that was good",Trissin,1
First Curse,Oathbreaker,1
No Land Beyond,Oathbreaker,1
i do not miss nlb,Trissin,1
lmaooooo,Trissin,1
"Skilled hands, good weapon",Oathbreaker,1
"in my hands, unusable weapon",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
i was real bad with it,Trissin,1
856,Arixama,1
Are you ready for the real kicker though?,Arixama,1
453 of that was on my warlock I deleted.,Arixama,1
oooooooooooof,Buttkikker,1
Because he looked dumb,Arixama,1
my titan looks dumb,Trissin,1
its why the helmet is never off,Trissin,1
loool,Trissin,1
"I couldn't do it. Plus with my original warlock not being awoken and not getting the special little dialouge in DC, it hurt me",Arixama,1
still can't log in :(,Pentan,1
What do we think odda are they'll bring back khvostov for new light?,Arixama,1
it'll probably just be traveller's chosen,Oathbreaker,1
we could use another exotic sidearm,Trissin,1
"idk what khvostov is but traveller's chosen is the sidearm from the intro, right?",Pentan,1
yeah,Oathbreaker,1
shh! do NOT ask for more sidearms,Pentan,1
khvostov was the Destiny 1 starting gun,Oathbreaker,1
more than anything theyre boring,Buttkikker,1
oh right,Pentan,1
"I think it'd be cool if they used khvostov, and then gave you the quest for the exotic once you got to tower",Arixama,1
the new emote looks pretty cool,Trissin,1
also it seems the menagerie chest bug is getting patched july 9,Trissin,1
farm your legendary shards now boys,Pentan,1
Oh man that emote is the greatest,RonInDune,1
I'm getting it for sure,RonInDune,1
still can't log in,Pentan,1
trissin that pic earlier was the scout from vog right? i also miss it :(,Pentan,1
One of my most asked for features in destiny is a Mirror of transformation like option to change our appearence,RonInDune,1
My hunter looks like she did her makeup in the dark,RonInDune,1
loool,Trissin,1
"Yep, slot a single rune in and just do the chest glitch",Oathbreaker,1
get yourselves a shitton of shards,Oathbreaker,1
She looks like she wanted to go full goth but lost interest halfway through her face,RonInDune,1
does anyone here really need more legendary shards though,Trissin,1
wait do you not have to keep reslotting runes every time you open it?,Pentan,1
Yeah you do,RonInDune,1
"i mean i'm sitting at 700 shards rn, but it takes a bit of effort to keep that up. also if i have more i can spend them on enhancement cores and whatnot",Pentan,1
oh yeah you might wanna farm some shards then,Trissin,1
I used some 10000 gunsmith tokens to go up to 2000 shards and I hover around that most of the time,RonInDune,1
that's a pretty solid amount,Trissin,1
Yeah and masterwork cores are not as rare as they used to be I feel like,RonInDune,1
I always have 250 or so,RonInDune,1
😮,Trissin,1
i need more masterwork cores,Trissin,1
Do the bounties!,RonInDune,1
Easy 9 cores every day,RonInDune,1
yes i started doing the bounties about a week ago they give a lot,Pentan,1
also the wanted bounties from spider,Pentan,1
oh my god,Trissin,1
that is a lot,Trissin,1
I'm at 1700 shards,Oathbreaker,1
what do you guys spend shards on???,Trissin,1
If you do the Gunsmith bounties right you get a stupid amount of cores per week,Oathbreaker,1
Well,Oathbreaker,1
I don't,Oathbreaker,1
lmao,Oathbreaker,1
?? what the heck,Trissin,1
It's mostly just in case Xur starts selling more stuff in the engram,Oathbreaker,1
maybe its cuz i dont visit xur,Trissin,1
Or to farm cores from Vance by having an overstock of Sim Seeds,Oathbreaker,1
lol,Trissin,1
"so the heroice menagerie bosses apparently drop unique swords that look like reskins of the class exclusive swords from year 1
there's also a ship and of course catalyst for izanagi's",Pentan,1
"I just logged on by the way, no issues.",Trissin,1
those are some cool beans,Pentan,1
"Just letting people know, seems like login is fixed",Trissin,1
ok so the swords all have new unique perks but the warlock sword has both perks from the hunter and titan swords for some reason?,Pentan,1
although the titan sword has heavy gaurd,Pentan,1
hunter sword it by far the worst imo,Pentan,1
it's worth mentioning that i'm talking about curated rolls,Pentan,1
"Let's see if we can do crown, heroic menagerie, shattered throne, etc. today if people are interested",Trissin,1
Whatever people need,Trissin,1
I'd definately like to run shattered throne. Still need that damn ship,Samakain,1
!lfg create,Pentan,1
uh oh,Pentan,1
whoops,Pentan,1
LOL,Trissin,1
😂 i just cracked myself up,Pentan,1
you should have left it there so people could laugh at it lol,Pentan,1
let me see if i can do it right this time,Pentan,1
!lfg create,Pentan,1
is there not one for shattered throne?,Pentan,1
no way,Trissin,1
there isn't,Pentan,1
oh well,Pentan,1
wait is it 6 or is it 3,Pentan,1
it's 3 😛,Samakain,1
yeah i quit,Pentan,1
"i mean, the both of you are online right now and ron and I are happy to help",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
I was about to say if we are all good to go we can knock it out now haha,Samakain,1
it's worth mentioning that i'm gonna eat dinner in about 45 minutes,Pentan,1
how long is it?,Pentan,1
"we can get it down in under 40 i think, right Trissin?",Samakain,1
yeah,Trissin,1
I think you can do it in around 6 minutes easy,RonInDune,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfSqHd4jWaA,RonInDune,1
do you need anything from shattered ron?,Trissin,1
Nah,RonInDune,1
but aren't there side bosses and whatnot?,Pentan,1
Only if you're after wishender,Samakain,1
"like i've never ran it before and only seen short clips, going in mostly blind",Pentan,1
i am definitely after wishender i don't have it yet,Pentan,1
it's ez clap,Trissin,1
aight whatever whoever wants to go just hop in voice ig,Pentan,1
"Cool, well Doing throne for the first time is a good reason to do throne imo. haha.",Samakain,1
I'm in orbit and good to go,Samakain,1
Hope you don't get the ship on your first encounter,Arixama,1
well you'll never guess what happened,Pentan,1
"Yeah, about that",Samakain,1
haha,Samakain,1
You gunna have some salty sues in here,Arixama,1
lol,RonInDune,1
"Well the ship drop rate is now 20%, so it's pretty high chance of getting it in your first run",RonInDune,1
First run is different than first ever encounter tho 🤣🤣,Arixama,1
True true,RonInDune,1
i also got the ship last encounter,Pentan,1
!spider,Trissin,1
is that glimmer for shards??,Trissin,1
does anyone know if the nessus barge chests are per character or account,Trissin,1
Per account,RonInDune,1
So are we raiding tonight?,RonInDune,1
yes,Trissin,1
Nice!,RonInDune,1
Also asking that makes me feel like a Viking about to attack some English towns,RonInDune,1
lmaoooo i know what you mean,Trissin,1
what raid are yall doin?,Arixama,1
"I was thinking crown, we could do something else tho",Trissin,1
"i wont be around, was just curious what you were going for",Arixama,1
crown has my vote,Pentan,1
I'm ok with crown or scourge,RonInDune,1
YA BOIS BACK WITH A VENGENCE BABY,Arixama,1
oh dang,RonInDune,1
hell yessss brother,Pentan,1
That looks like something from the Matrix,RonInDune,1
no more shitty grainy gameplay for me,Arixama,1
ok so i need to complete a heroic public event for this quest but of course the quest doesn't bother to tell you that you can't solo it because you need to be in two places at once so i just waited 15 minutes for the event to spawn and now i have to wait again,Pentan,1
"yeah thanks ghost, thanks for the level up, that really helps",Pentan,1
you can't solo it?,Trissin,1
"like i said, you have to be in two places at once",Pentan,1
which public event?,Trissin,1
i mean it's probably possible but really difficult,Pentan,1
it's the spire defense in the hallows on nessus,Pentan,1
you have to stand on a plate for like a minute to make it heroic and also guard the spire on the other side of a rather large wall,Pentan,1
"oh, that one",Trissin,1
"damn, that sucks yeah",Trissin,1
someone mind hopping in voice so you can join me the next time the event pops up?,Pentan,1
@Trissin could you just join me real quick or are you busy? event is about to start,Pentan,1
i'd like to nominate trissin for best clan leader NA,Pentan,1
did you get it?,Arixama,1
"yes, thankfully",Pentan,1
it's really not hard except for the being in two places at once part,Pentan,1
just needed somebody to stand on the other side of the room,Pentan,1
i know its also timed,Arixama,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
Seems we're missing 2,Trissin,1
"it would appear that way, yes",Pentan,1
Sup. raid time?,Morton,1
"Just gonna do a quick easy crown, get the challenge done as well. Feel free to join us!",Trissin,1
Oops,Trissin,1
LOL,Trissin,1
where is the voice channel?,Morton,1
"Sorry, Morton, we're actually full haha",Trissin,1
well your loss,Morton,1
😉,Morton,1
We're in the voice channel @Buttkikker @RonInDune,Trissin,1
this is awful what is this,Pentan,1
Basically it's just a run of Leviathan with a team that knows you want to kill the watchers; it can be done in a single go,Thawxtem,1
well yes but what is the quest for?,Pentan,1
key for box that has Izanagi's Burden,Thawxtem,1
"if the material only comes from the watchers, then where does calus get materials for the watchers? from other watchers? where did those watchers come from? is it some element like vibranium and calus just has a monopoly on it and decided to put ALL of it in silly little alarm turrets?",Pentan,1
i bet it's the jelly,Pentan,1
"Nah, Ana-1 is just lazy. We're killing watchers and stealing their no-longer-needed lenses. She doesn't want to build any lenses herself",Thawxtem,1
"You don't even actually need to run leviathan, you can just go into the raid, and go directly into the underbelly and farm engine room",Arixama,1
Engine room farm is stupid fast,Oathbreaker,1
"thunderlord is random loot pool, right?",Pentan,1
yup,Buttkikker,1
i don't have it and just pulled an exotic i already had out of xur's engram,Pentan,1
might be post forsaken loot,Buttkikker,1
xur still only has forsaken and earlier,Buttkikker,1
"Same here, regarding the engram. second week that it's refused to give me the loot I don't have, and it's a non-quest helm from Warmind",Thawxtem,1
are you collecting the engram as  a titan?,Buttkikker,1
"Hunter, which I need the helm for",Thawxtem,1
oh duno why i thought titan,Buttkikker,1
what helm?,Buttkikker,1
Thunderlord is festival of the lost which could be a weird loophole,Arixama,1
that's true,Pentan,1
it's funny how i walked away from festival of the lost with horror story and not thunderlord,Pentan,1
i'm really smart,Pentan,1
Also that you didn't grab it during arc week,Arixama,1
i wasn't playing during arc week :(,Pentan,1
i dropped the game during festival of the lost until a couple weeks ago,Pentan,1
Thunderlord was stupidly time gated,Arixama,1
thawx if its wormhusk crown its from zavala after beating the warming campaighn,Buttkikker,1
cant spell,Buttkikker,1
Started last week of fotl and was just go check out some lost sectors for 3 weeks,Arixama,1
"Wormhusk is the only hunter helmet exotic from warmind, so that's what it is",Arixama,1
It didn't work like the aeons where if you got one you could get the others as a random drop on your other characters,Arixama,1
oh whatt did you have to do for the first one?,Buttkikker,1
been awhile,Buttkikker,1
First aeon was for completing curse of osiris,Arixama,1
ah,Buttkikker,1
that would explain it; it just never says in the description that it was tied to a quest,Thawxtem,1
"Yeah, it's stupid. Its because I can drop from the world after you complete warmind",Arixama,1
so if you complete warmind can xur then drop it?,Pentan,1
"Yup, and it can drop from engrams and shit",Arixama,1
"Xur can't drop opulence exotics, right?",Trissin,1
nope,Buttkikker,1
Nope. Only forsaken or earlier,Arixama,1
"damn, i want peregrine greaves :((",Trissin,1
Good for trying to get random rolls though,Arixama,1
I didn't know until recently that exotic engrams usually come from prime engram drops,Arixama,1
"Play lots of menagerie/blind well, somehow that's where I've been getting most of my exotics",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I gotta play some menagerie",Trissin,1
High enemy count plus lots of orange bars,Arixama,1
"Speaking of which, I'm clearing my DC, then heading to menagerie probably. anyone care to join?",Thawxtem,1
i wanna run menagerie to farm shards but i need more runes for austringer as well,Pentan,1
"^
I'm gonna be farming austringer as well",Trissin,1
Make sure to get your 200 rune triumph done before the 9th!,Arixama,1
right!!,Trissin,1
y?,Thawxtem,1
theyre fixing the multiple chests thing,Buttkikker,1
!!!,Thawxtem,1
"lol, i love the emotion conveyed by just !!!",Trissin,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
what's the 200 rune triumph?,Pentan,1
exactly what is sounds like,Trissin,1
so does putting worthless runes in slot 3 count toward progress or does it only count items made like black armory?,Thawxtem,1
I'm pretty sure it's just slot,Trissin,1
you get 3 runes of progress if you have all slots filled,Buttkikker,1
"It's runes used, not items collected",Arixama,1
So fill up all three for max progress,Arixama,1
Apparently the new sword from heroic menagerie can roll some pretty crazy stuff,Trissin,1
Shattering Blade + Counterattack,Trissin,1
i think its the titan one,Buttkikker,1
"Yeah, that's the one",Trissin,1
Throne Splitter,Trissin,1
I think it's void as well,Trissin,1
ooh,Buttkikker,1
good for COS 3rd encounter,Buttkikker,1
"Guys I have a bunch of humble bundle keys being wasted for a while now, does anyone want any of these games?",RonInDune,1
"I saw a video from aztecross recently, apparently throne splitter with tractor cannon, shattering blade, and counterattack buffs stacked together is like 5.6x one heavy swing damage",Trissin,1
testing on greg was like 45000 damage,Trissin,1
which is actually just insane,Trissin,1
Poor greg,RonInDune,1
insert flextape meme*,Buttkikker,1
so uh... i think i just skipped a quest step?,Pentan,1
i still have the black armory key mold. haven't even been to leviathan since i got it last night. a black armory key just dropped from a forge ignition though and it looks like the blueprint on the key mold quest,Pentan,1
"Just for reference, a whisper headshot on greg is like 8.5k",Trissin,1
that's a lot of damage,Pentan,1
who is greg and why do we hate him?,Pentan,1
lost sector boss on titan used for a standard damage reference,Buttkikker,1
yeah him,Buttkikker,1
oh hey greg,Pentan,1
anybody have any idea what's going on with the quest i mentioned?,Pentan,1
@Pentan I haven't heard of it before,Trissin,1
what key dropped,Buttkikker,1
^,Trissin,1
theres 3 keys they have very simmilar models,Buttkikker,1
ok yeah,Buttkikker,1
thats one of four,Buttkikker,1
the quest is just for the last one,Buttkikker,1
I dont even remember how this all works,Trissin,1
There's so much stuff,Trissin,1
the shield drones need to be destroyed at each forge on the second wave for a chest to spawn at the end giving you a key,Buttkikker,1
or the quest if its from bergusia,Buttkikker,1
ohh ok,Trissin,1
and tangerine doesn't have the box yet?,Trissin,1
guess not,Buttkikker,1
its hidden near volunder,Buttkikker,1
"apparently i do not have a yellow box, no",Pentan,1
oh youre gonna want to grab that,Trissin,1
i see,Pentan,1
you can then insert the keys,Buttkikker,1
once its filled you get the next step towards the exotic,Buttkikker,1
"Also, @RonInDune , those are some pretty good games! You should try them out for yourself!",Trissin,1
I already have them all! got them again in bundles so they're sitting there being wasted...,RonInDune,1
ohhh didn't realize you already owned them lol,Trissin,1
Yeah these bundles can get too much sometimes lol,RonInDune,1
anyone know where the ascendant challenge is this week?,Thawxtem,1
!weekly,Trissin,1
thx,Thawxtem,1
!daily,Arixama,1
finally got mah title!,Thawxtem,1
"ooh, congrats!!!!",Trissin,1
Congrats!!!!,RonInDune,1
"that makes two, what next?",Thawxtem,1
Welcome to the Lore Nerds Clubs,RonInDune,1
Dredgen/Wayfarer,RonInDune,1
Those are the only kinda easy ones remaining,RonInDune,1
I wouldn't say dredgen is easy,Trissin,1
"I am going to try to finish u[p Dregen this season, just got the three resets left",Nahkriin,1
It's easier. Protect the runner is probably the roughest part of it.,Arixama,1
"Wayfarer is something I'm stuck on until the right situations come; I'm missing Warmind nightfall gun, Ikelos shotgun & 1 of the guns from the nodes",Thawxtem,1
"Do I need to be the runner protected, or just someone on my team?",Thawxtem,1
Just on your team,Arixama,1
"I know I need it too, so if we could get a team together to try for it tonight, I'd be down for that",Arixama,1
"I'm off today, so I'd love to!",Thawxtem,1
i'm in,Pentan,1
!lfg create,Thawxtem,1
"I'm not sure when I'll be available, but the earliest will be 530 but probably after 6",Arixama,1
I can be on in about 20 min,Nahkriin,1
Do we have a collector?,Arixama,1
I can try; we don't have only one attempt,Thawxtem,1
I play collector but I won't be available at 6. If you don't get it tonight I can help tomorrow though.,Nahkriin,1
@Trissin would you be available later?,Arixama,1
"Not today, sorry",Trissin,1
"I might be on tonight, but it would be a lot later",Trissin,1
"If you guys are still on and looking, I'll definitely help out yeah",Trissin,1
lol aight,Pentan,1
i just got the exotic bow along with my first blast furnace,Pentan,1
the black armory exotic bow that is,Pentan,1
Lemon arc,Arixama,1
"^
i like it a lot",Trissin,1
lol yes that's the one,Pentan,1
"took me a minute to translate ""lemon arc""",Thawxtem,1
underrated exotic tbh,Trissin,1
The lemon is magnificent,RonInDune,1
i mean i don't really use bows all that much,Pentan,1
is it good in crucible or something?,Pentan,1
_Several people are typing..._,Trissin,1
It's pretty good in gambit and crucible honestly,RonInDune,1
sounds like Thorn II - The Bow,Pentan,1
would bows be too slow to protect the runner?,Thawxtem,1
"Yeah, sorta. If you like bows for PVP, then lemonade is good",Trissin,1
It's thorn before thorn was in d2 basically,Arixama,1
"I like how satisfying it feels too, a very heavy *thunk*",RonInDune,1
I'm just not fast enough with aiming for lemonade to be good for me in straight pvp,Thawxtem,1
Plus it takes out invaders in two hits,RonInDune,1
I'm excited for whatever the heavy bow is gunna be,Arixama,1
"It's got pretty good single target damage as a bow, but the exotic perk also offers ad clear",Trissin,1
"my first blast furnace has accurized, zen moment and rampage",Pentan,1
not that bad,Pentan,1
Hunter + edz duds + 3 bows = Green Arrow,Thawxtem,1
Not bad at all,Trissin,1
We need goatee option during character customization to go full green arrow,RonInDune,1
the character customization is pretty derpy in destiny honestly,Pentan,1
i just keep my helmet on,Pentan,1
no use outside tower/farm,Thawxtem,1
other than cutscenes,Thawxtem,1
thank goodness too because most characters don't look that great,Pentan,1
I'm so disappointed we won't see Zachary Levi as green arrow,Arixama,1
"True, but I like the swirly awoken effects, makes me look like an Asari",RonInDune,1
"Also, we need to have a private gambit match as a clan of 8 members for a triumph sometime",Thawxtem,1
"Oh yeah, I was wondering if people would be interested in something like that",Trissin,1
that's gonna be intense,Pentan,1
clan gambit/pvp/whatever,Trissin,1
I didn't know there was a triumph for it,Trissin,1
"I love zen moment in auto rifles, turns them into a trace rifle like laser",RonInDune,1
do you have horror story?,Pentan,1
because it's pretty great for an auto rifle and it comes with zen,Pentan,1
Nah I didn't like the Halloween event much so I didn't grind,RonInDune,1
Breakneck/misfit are my fave autos,RonInDune,1
"I miss valakadyn, from like year 1",Trissin,1
Scathelocke best auto 2k17,Arixama,1
don't forget uriel's gift,Pentan,1
I miss my y1 loadout.,Arixama,1
"Scathelocke, mob Justice, perfect paradox",Arixama,1
ok i'm running 3 heavy ammo finder and i can use nothing but sword and GAIN ammo,Pentan,1
that's crazy,Trissin,1
"i've always felt heavy ammo finders are weird tho, they aren't always reliable",Trissin,1
like it's very inconsistent,Trissin,1
yeah i think it's because even with the ammo finder it's still a low drop rate but once you have 2 or more i notice a HUGE difference in heavy ammo most* of the time,Pentan,1
also blast furnace is ridiculous,Pentan,1
like the stability is absurd,Pentan,1
"oh yeah, you still need outbreak",Trissin,1
the range is absurd,Pentan,1
the gun is a laser,Pentan,1
Yeah blast furnace is my fave legendary,RonInDune,1
and yes i should grab outbreak really quick thanks for reminder,Pentan,1
i'd recommend bringing a fireteam for zero hour,Trissin,1
uh yes i could use some help lol,Pentan,1
"The Halo MCC flight has begun, did anyone here get in?",RonInDune,1

It looks so good in motion!  For a 10 year old game especially,RonInDune,1
"Watching a stream, it kinda feels like Destiny",RonInDune,1
god has it been 10 years,Pentan,1
"I thought it was 2009 but it's actually 2010, so it's been 9-ish years",RonInDune,1
nah i didn't get in. from what i hear the selection at the moment is extremely narrow,Pentan,1
supposedly this first flight is to make sure the flighting system works lol,Pentan,1
"Makes sense, Microsoft flights are very heavily regulated",RonInDune,1
"Oh man the scout rifle the dude is using is so good, that's what D2 scouts should feel like",RonInDune,1
who are you watching?,Trissin,1

lmaoo same,Trissin,1
oh man that looks fun,Trissin,1
Man I forgot you could fly in Halo,RonInDune,1
finally got another roll on retold tale and it has the EXACT same perks as my current,Pentan,1
"Wow, Nighthawk is OP in Osiris story. One-shot the boss (from strike, not penoptis)",Thawxtem,1
nighthawk is just op in general but yes,Pentan,1
is there a way to re-post the lfgcreate down here?,Thawxtem,1
Oh man the systems I'm working with right now has SLI-d Titan Xp and I'm so tempted to install Destiny to see how high the frames can go,RonInDune,1
I think the lfgcreate warns people when the time is nigh?,RonInDune,1
I just figured there was an hour left and I wanted to refresh the lfg down here so we could maybe get a 4th,Thawxtem,1
an hour left? i thought it was about to start,Pentan,1
i was off by an hour i guess,Pentan,1
7pm CST which is 8pm EST,Oathbreaker,1
gonna need to push it back just a tad in that case,Pentan,1
yeah i could have sworn it said 6pm for me (cst),Pentan,1
i'm just blind,Pentan,1
!lfg alert 538,RonInDune,1
@Thawxtem you can do !lfg edit 538,RonInDune,1
!lfg edit 538,Thawxtem,1
@RonInDune that did nothing,Thawxtem,1
do the alert thing again,Pentan,1
see if it has updated time,Pentan,1
"wait, what are you trying to do?",Thawxtem,1
what am i trying to do?,Pentan,1
!LFG search 538,Arixama,1
i'm just probably gonna eat dinner at about 7 but it won't take long,Pentan,1
that's what I was trying to achieve. thanks,Thawxtem,1
i mean if you really don't want to wait then go ahead without me if you have someone else,Pentan,1
did we need to change times?,Thawxtem,1
just by like 20 minutes? maybe 30 tops?,Pentan,1
later?,Thawxtem,1
yes 20-30 minutes later,Pentan,1
!lfg edit 538,Thawxtem,1

Do we have enough people to try for a heroic menagerie later tonight?,RonInDune,1

film grain,Pentan,1
skip to 1:35 if the link doesn't for you,Pentan,1
I remember film grain in Mass Effect made the game look so weird in indoor settings sometimes,RonInDune,1
Especially during the elevator sequences,RonInDune,1
yeah that's the game i mentioned earlier to thawx to try to give an example lol,Pentan,1
I remember the first Max Payne had it too I think? But it looked so cool I didn't care,RonInDune,1
it was really obvious in the citadel and on that tropical planet,Pentan,1
I've basically been playing destiny with film grain at max for the past 3 months.,Arixama,1
you poor soul,Pentan,1
And now everything is clear,Arixama,1
"I can see clearly now, the grain is gone 🎵",Pentan,1
My most important destiny setting is the fov,RonInDune,1
I found 105 FOV  to be the best,RonInDune,1
i might have to leave the clan because you guys barely laugh at my jokes and that's just a deal breaker,Pentan,1
but yes fov is super important,Pentan,1
"Alright i'm back, what shall I do tonight",Trissin,1
I think i'll play some destiny :)),Trissin,1
"To get the triumph for doing menagerie with the full armour set, do we have to keep wearing it throught the encounter?",RonInDune,1
I'm not sure :S,Trissin,1
How was gambit?? Did you guys get the triumph??,Trissin,1
"Yeah, first match",Arixama,1
"Holy cow, congrats",RonInDune,1
"holy crap, nice!!",Trissin,1
!!!,RonInDune,1
We were able to pull matos,Arixama,1
"ah, that's good",Trissin,1
I literally have never changed my fov,Arixama,1
you should do it,Trissin,1
Initially it feels like you're running faster,RonInDune,1
But you get used to it,RonInDune,1
"Hey @Pentan , i dont really have anything im doing right now - want to grab outbreak?",Trissin,1
"i really appreciate the offer but i gotta leave in about 7 hours, already up way too late 😂",Pentan,1
gn lads,Pentan,1
night!,Trissin,1
This roll has been my white whale for a while now... Sureshot/Ricochet/Zen Moment/Outlaw with Range MW,Oathbreaker,1
This is replacing JQK3 for my energy slot HC now,Oathbreaker,1
:o,Trissin,1
It feels so crisp,Oathbreaker,1
Damn that's a solid roll,Trissin,1
Zen Moment fixes the weird Vigil recoil too so the bounce is minimized and it's just so fucking good,Oathbreaker,1
Congrats!!!!,Trissin,1
"Hmm I'll see if I can get those same rolls for an Austringer, I've been grinding that and Beloved for a while now",RonInDune,1
Still chasing my Beloved roll,Oathbreaker,1
I accidentally sharded a No distractions/Moving Target roll and feel pretty bad about it,RonInDune,1
I'm looking for Snapshot/Quickdraw,Oathbreaker,1
i got an okay Snapshot/Moving Target one but really want to minmax it lol,Oathbreaker,1
Why quickdraw? Is the timing that helpful?,RonInDune,1
For Beloved it just makes the gun feel super snappy,Oathbreaker,1
If I need to quickly swap to snipe then other snipes take a long time to draw out,Oathbreaker,1
"Quickdraw makes it very, well, quick. Pair that with the 2nd lowest zoom scope and a good AA value, Beloved is a great snipe for me",Oathbreaker,1
Also TLW can be paired with it,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh that's a good combo, never thought about that pairing",RonInDune,1
I paired TLW with a pulse,RonInDune,1
i got in a fight with a lake today,Pentan,1
i lost btw,Pentan,1
many different parts of my body are red for many different reasons,Pentan,1
Uh.... I have questions?,Oathbreaker,1
shoot,Pentan,1
How and why?,Oathbreaker,1
mostly tubing,Pentan,1
got rubbed raw in several places by this awful tube,Pentan,1
"also i got several sunburns, mostly on the backs of my legs. never been burnt there before, but it's bad",Pentan,1
and falling off the tube while going about 30mph hurts a lot if you didn't know,Pentan,1
my muscles are also no longer working properly until further notice,Pentan,1
i was on the water for about 6 hours and probably spent more time on the tube than in the boat,Pentan,1
This is what you get for going outside. Honestly.,Samakain,1
"I'm not gonna be on destiny for a while, will be visiting some family.",Trissin,1
I'll be online on discord and stuff though,Trissin,1
"Sounds good man, have a good time!",Oathbreaker,1
"Currently on a road trip until the 10th, but I've got my laptop with so I'll be able to do some stuff in a pinch",Arixama,1
Have fun @Trissin ! I'll look after the kids for ya!,RonInDune,1
time to start the rebellion,Pentan,1
:BAguns:,Arixama,1
Who among us shall lead the rebellion?,Oathbreaker,1
:sepiksgoogly:,Arixama,1
i could use some help with either the outbreak quest or the bow quest in the shattered throne,Pentan,1
i have the 3 tokens or coins or whatever and i think the next step is in the shattered throne,Pentan,1
nobody wants to help me 😢,Pentan,1
"@Pentan I may have someone, including myself, could you enter voice chat?",Thawxtem,1
@Thawxtem yeah sorry i stepped away for a minute but i'm good now,Pentan,1
i'm in voice,Pentan,1
Sorry I'm hanging out with friends,Oathbreaker,1
"Don't worry Oath, we got his outbreak",Thawxtem,1
yeah i got outbreak now,Pentan,1
that was a lot harder than i expected,Pentan,1
Nice congrats!,RonInDune,1
from what i hear the masterwork is a pain,Pentan,1
Don't forget to start trying to masterwork it!,RonInDune,1
yeah...,Pentan,1
"Not really, it's just a bit tedious and you'll need 3 people to do it fast",RonInDune,1
how do i get masterwork to drop exactly? do i need a quest or what?,Pentan,1
Nah you have to run the mission 3 more times on 3 different weeks on heroic,RonInDune,1
"You'll have to pick up a mission item at the start of the run, follow a slightly different path, and have to solve a *long* puzzle at the end",RonInDune,1
Did you get to do it blind @Pentan ?,Trissin,1
yup,Pentan,1
Perfect!,RonInDune,1
trevor is now my least favorite person,Pentan,1
lmao,Trissin,1
Doing it blind alongside @Trissin was one of my fave destiny experiences,RonInDune,1
You know true fear,Trissin,1
OH MY GOD,Oathbreaker,1
I CAN SHOW MY BUDDY TREVOR,Oathbreaker,1
YOU GUYS HAVE JUST MADE MY NIGHT,Oathbreaker,1
yw,Pentan,1
thanks for the help tonight thawx. we'll have to keep going another time,Pentan,1
i'm exhausted and i've gotta be up tomorrow,Pentan,1
🇨🇦🇨🇦HAPPY🇨🇦🇨🇦CANADA🇨🇦🇨🇦DAY🇨🇦🇨🇦,Arixama,1
":o lumina is going live today, isn't it?",Trissin,1
"No, tomorrow",Trissin,1
lmk how it goes!,Trissin,1
i need some help with shattered throne before reset kicks in,Pentan,1
need to finish up my bow quest,Pentan,1
Sure I can help tonight,RonInDune,1
anybody else?,Pentan,1
ill likely be available,Buttkikker,1
coolio beans,Pentan,1
Far enough south to be hearing those southern accents,Arixama,1
no idea what you're on about mate,Pentan,1
i just got the new warlock exotic helmet as well as huckleberry catalyst from the same daily heroic adventure,Pentan,1
:o,Trissin,1
go do huckleberry catalyst!! It's a good gun for pve,Trissin,1
I'm traveling. 😂,Arixama,1
"Huckleberry is real good, and the catalyst is super easy to do",Arixama,1
cool beans,Pentan,1
now the only warlock exotic i don't have is getaway artist,Pentan,1
"Yeah finish up the Huck catalyst ASAP, it takes the gun from being merely pretty good to absolute god-tier",RonInDune,1
i don't have enough weapon parts to pull it from collections lol,Pentan,1
Oh dang,RonInDune,1
Weaponsmith parts is one thing I have way to much of,RonInDune,1
This Wendigo quest is silly. 1500 is just too damn high.,Samakain,1
**AGREE**,Trissin,1
"Running 3 grenade launchers is the way to go honestly, even then it's such a chore",RonInDune,1
I mean it finally gives me an excuse to grind out my fighting lion catalyst but still. Urgh.,Samakain,1
yeah it's bonkers,Pentan,1
i was just running a heavy launcher and lion because that's all i have,Pentan,1
i've always just turned in my weapon parts because i never thought they'd be good for anything except maybe getting a good roll on something,Pentan,1
and then i learned about black armory,Pentan,1
now i turn them into mod components,Pentan,1
@RonInDune @Buttkikker you good to go for shattered throne in like 10 minutes?,Pentan,1
Oh sorry no I'm still at work for another couple of hours,RonInDune,1
Let me finish this strike and i'll run throne.,Samakain,1
alright good stuff,Pentan,1
im good to go,Buttkikker,1
👍,Pentan,1
"give me a few, taking care of my doggo",Pentan,1
@Buttkikker we're ready,Pentan,1
who should i join on?,Buttkikker,1
"if anybody has sudden onset feelings of self hatred and wants to do the heroic mission for outbreak, then @me",Pentan,1
@Pentan I can be on in a minute,Thawxtem,1
My only condition is to suffer through Menagerie once with me,Thawxtem,1
id love to get a heroic menagerie going before reset,Buttkikker,1
I'll be in fireteam chat,Thawxtem,1
idk i just started playing stardew and kinda crashed. i really didn't get much sleep last night after our shattered throne run,Pentan,1
don't really have the emotional energy to put myself through heroic menagerie rn lol,Pentan,1
I wasn't asking heroic,Thawxtem,1
i'm just gonna chill for the rest of the night. thanks anyway thawx,Pentan,1
k,Thawxtem,1
gravitation lance catalyst!,Thawxtem,1
Nice!!!!,RonInDune,1
im so sorry for you,Buttkikker,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
it suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks to do,Buttkikker,1
what is it,Thawxtem,1
I've heard masterworking is an excellently pleasant experience,RonInDune,1
you need 1000 kills with the cosmology perk,Buttkikker,1
I remember it was horrible in y1 but I think it's much better now,Trissin,1
was it even worse then?,Buttkikker,1
don't even know what that is... haven't used it in so long,Thawxtem,1
when you kill somthing little particles fly out and explode,Buttkikker,1
it can cause a chain reaction to very low hp enemies but your average acolyte is fine,Buttkikker,1
Farm it either in Blind well or the whisper mission infinite thrallway,RonInDune,1
Lucked out and randomly qued in a group farming Wendigo in blind well. So thats done now at least!,Samakain,1
Congrats!,Oathbreaker,1
How's the lumina quest???,Trissin,1
just started,Buttkikker,1
its interesting so far,Buttkikker,1
"Also, strange terrain is a nightfall this week for those who need it!",Trissin,1
It's osprey week,Trissin,1
Heard it's a long and grindy go,RonInDune,1
But I couldn't log in at all due to saxophone errors so I'll see later tonight,RonInDune,1
Ooh ok,Trissin,1
Also the grimoire vol 2 is for sale now,RonInDune,1
I'll order asap,RonInDune,1
I heard there's a discount with the emote,Trissin,1
Yah but I couldn't log in so that'll have to wait,RonInDune,1
"yeah i got the message on login. @RonInDune @Trissin if you buy the new emote, you get 20% off the grimoire",Pentan,1
i spent so much time grinding for light when i did most of my playing in year 1 and early forsaken that it feels weird to not care about weekly reset for any reason other than raids,Pentan,1
the emote cost $10 worth of silver though lol RIP,Pentan,1
Eh considering how cool it looks I'm fine with it,RonInDune,1
yes it looks great but i'm not paying $10 for an emote,Pentan,1
"like if i was gonna get the book too, then sure because it probably almost cancels out",Pentan,1
i'll just get it from loot pool eventually,Pentan,1
Ah I see yeah I'm definitely getting the book so it makes sense for me,RonInDune,1
dreaming spectrum best shader,Pentan,1
I don't think itll be in the loot pool tangerine,Trissin,1
never?,Pentan,1
"also yes, dreaming spectrum best shader THANK YOU",Trissin,1
probably never,Trissin,1
well damn. i'll just live without it,Pentan,1
Dreaming Spectrum is not the best shader,Oathbreaker,1
what's better,Trissin,1
"Midnight Smith, Meyrin, Cinderchar, one of the new Gambit ones I can't remember, Metro Shift, Gift of the Nine are just some examples",Oathbreaker,1
"Dreaming Spectrum is good, don't get me wrong, but those IMO are better",Oathbreaker,1
Spectrum shades weird on a lot of things,Oathbreaker,1
gift of the nine is also pretty great,Pentan,1
but it's no dreaming spectrum,Pentan,1
"Gift shades damn near everything without any issues, Spectrum has issues",Oathbreaker,1
"aight fine, broken combos aside, dreaming spectrum is the shit",Pentan,1
which is dreaming spectrum all i can think of is blueshift dreams,Buttkikker,1
i think it's from last wish?,Pentan,1
"Still disagree, the when spectrum looks good others still look better IMO",Oathbreaker,1
Not trying to knock the choice or anything lol,Oathbreaker,1
Very nice shader when it works,Oathbreaker,1
I really do like the new opulence shaders as well,Trissin,1
But that's a big *when*,Oathbreaker,1
ok i just got it off of a bad chattering bones roll,Buttkikker,1
Imperial dress is pretty cool,Trissin,1
ill have to take a look at it,Buttkikker,1
Man I want trials to come back,Trissin,1
yes please,Pentan,1
Not that I'm good at PvP in any capacity,Trissin,1
But the loot is cool,Trissin,1
i dunno im not a huge fan of the color purple in the first place but it looks really good on threat level,Buttkikker,1
and on the COS armor,Buttkikker,1
Imperial dress looks really wonky on some things lol,Trissin,1
oh i meant dreaming spectrum dont think i have imperial dress,Buttkikker,1
oh ok ok,Trissin,1
Trissin,Oathbreaker,1
i see the appeal just the purple is too dark,Buttkikker,1
Why did you have to mention Trials,Oathbreaker,1
Now I'm sad,Oathbreaker,1
:c,Trissin,1
i just realized i never got the ascendant chests around the dreaming city,Pentan,1
The best is the bright pink shader on the fluffy balloon like spire armour,RonInDune,1
Actually turn into the creature from Ghostbusters,RonInDune,1
Nebula rose?,Arixama,1
Yup,RonInDune,1
just got boss spec from a world drop misfit,Pentan,1
boss spec or boss resist,Trissin,1
boss spec,Pentan,1
I suppose a weapon can't drop with a resist mod....,Trissin,1
I'm dumb,Trissin,1
lol,Pentan,1
"That's nice I guess, but can't you buy those from Banshee?",Trissin,1
oh idk,Pentan,1
"i thought it was the rare one, but what do i know",Pentan,1
"Yeah, pretty sure boss resist is the rare one",Trissin,1
It has a tiny chance to come on reckoning gambit armor,Trissin,1
i guess that makes more sense :derp:,Pentan,1
"alright. for the record, i just counted and double checked my glimmer, and there are 15 chests on the barge. total cost to open all of them is 75k glimmer",Pentan,1
How many Imperials do u get from it?,Trissin,1
150 per chest,Pentan,1
2250 then?,Trissin,1
yup,Pentan,1
33.333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333 glimmer per imperial,Pentan,1
I like the precision,Trissin,1
thank,Pentan,1
"i wanted to do more but there's a 2,000 character limit on discord messages",Pentan,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
lol,Trissin,1
crazy,Matos,1
you guys had a ted talk on shaders,Matos,1
and bergusian night nor artic pearl were mentioned,Matos,1
what a world,Matos,1
Tru bergusian night is a good one,Trissin,1
rasmussen clan is better imo,Buttkikker,1
but arctic pearl idk 🤔,Trissin,1
but like i said not one for purple,Buttkikker,1
pffft,Matos,1
PFFFFT,Matos,1
how's the Lumina Quest?,Matos,1
Apex season 2 starts today so  that will keep me busy,Matos,1
lumina quest is a bit grindy so far but enjoyable,Buttkikker,1
"wouldn't know, i'm forever grinding for a god roll retold tale",Pentan,1
Apparently the tracking on the healing ball is insane,RonInDune,1
It'll literally do a 180 to track someone,RonInDune,1
"I just started it, and the second step is 250 orbs generated. I'm already half way through that.",Arixama,1
ez on blind well,Buttkikker,1
i did it with a masterworked riskrunner,Buttkikker,1
I loaded into a public event on titan and got 100,Arixama,1
Lumina is stupid busted in PvP,Oathbreaker,1
20% damage buff,Oathbreaker,1
For both people,Oathbreaker,1
Plus instant healing,Oathbreaker,1
"Lumina/Shotgun is gonna be the one meta setup, TLW/Snipe will be the other",Oathbreaker,1
Whoa,Trissin,1
20% damage buff?,Trissin,1
so are we gonna have somebody in every raid running melting point/tractor cannon AND lumina?,Pentan,1
"I think it depends on damage output, because buffing all other 5 players by 20 is equivalent to just doing damage directly",Trissin,1
Yeah it's like middle tree void titan with the shield,RonInDune,1
"We'll see how long the buff lasts, if it's easy to do, and whether or not we'll actually need the healing during damage phase",Trissin,1
The real question,Arixama,1
Is does lumina trigger benevolent dawn?,Arixama,1
The Warlock ability regen? If it does it'll be crazy,Trissin,1
So much healing,Trissin,1
my god,Pentan,1
"i really doubt it, but that would be busted",Pentan,1
the description just says healing or buffing allies,Buttkikker,1
"i mean, if the ability works exactly as described, then yes, but i still really doubt it",Pentan,1
"To trigger a noble round it's the same as thorn, right? Kill something, pick up the remnant, and the next hip-fired round is noble?",Trissin,1
"The warlock healing rift is hilariously busted in the shattered throne with the right mods, I left a trail of rifts almost all the way around the room",RonInDune,1
Lool,Trissin,1
It's be fun to try the gun there,RonInDune,1
In the morgeth fight,RonInDune,1
ron what are you talking about?,Pentan,1
"""what are healing rifts? I only know empowering rifts""",Trissin,1
lol,RonInDune,1
"If you have some Taken Invigoration mods, stack them and then kill some yellow or orange bars",RonInDune,1
you get your rift back instantly,RonInDune,1
damn,Pentan,1
"If you have more than one person with you, then even one mod is enough",RonInDune,1
or you could do the same as hunter and get your dodge back instantly! that would be so crazy! imagine having dodge up 24/7! :travelergoogly: :ecksdee:,Pentan,1
i always have dodge up 24/7,Buttkikker,1
cus i never use it,Buttkikker,1
i really do feel bad for hunters though,Pentan,1
aside from the one tree where they proc camo on dodge it's pretty useless,Pentan,1
yeah honestly it's pretty easy to perma invis most of the way through throne,RonInDune,1
"my buddy Littlepants did that for PvP, he put on sixth coyote and a bunch of Paragon mods",Trissin,1
pair that with lord of wolves (or any shotgun really) and that's pretty terrifying,Pentan,1
looks like i've got a bit of time to hop onto destiny,Trissin,1
"Oh cool, when will you be on?",RonInDune,1
Anybody up for a 50k nightfall quick?,Arixama,1
I need to farm Strange Terrain for Wayfarer,RonInDune,1
But I can't come right now sorry,RonInDune,1
Good luck,RonInDune,1
i might be able to help out ari,Trissin,1
Awesome. We should get you to that step first though,Arixama,1
sure thing,Trissin,1
"i just picked up the quest in edz, gotta do the lost sector",Trissin,1
Has anyone figured this out yet?,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/Cozmo23/status/1146169065745989632,RonInDune,1
😮 i wonder what it is,Trissin,1
@Oathbreaker tell us!!!!,RonInDune,1
Honestly have no clue,Oathbreaker,1
"Might be bows, could be damn near anything",Oathbreaker,1
"The 20% buff makes things pretty strong, Ace can 2 tap with Mori active",Oathbreaker,1
Hmm hmm a likely story,RonInDune,1
It also makes Thorn ticks do 9 damage instead of 7 with its buff active,Oathbreaker,1
would 20% be enough for fusion grenade one hits?,Pentan,1
been a long time since i've even tried them,Pentan,1
I don't think so,Oathbreaker,1
anybody wanna play some comp? haven't touched it since season 2 and one match by accident a couple days ago,Pentan,1
i'm not sure if i want to so i'll let you guys decide. anybody wanna run last wish?,Pentan,1
Got work tomorrow morning so I'm out for that,Oathbreaker,1
yeah it doesn't look like anyone wants to,Pentan,1
just carried a comp match so hard. had a kd of 4.0 with 32 kills and my teammates kds were .47 and .53. both teams only had 3 players the whole game,Pentan,1
we won 45-44,Pentan,1
Holy cow,RonInDune,1
just published a novel in general chat,Pentan,1
Ah truly the GRRM of our times,RonInDune,1
What the heck why are shipping costs so high on the bungie store!!!!,RonInDune,1
😮,Trissin,1
thats so expensive,Trissin,1
wait did you get the discount from the emote?,Trissin,1
These rates are insane!,RonInDune,1
Yeah I did,RonInDune,1
wow what the heck,Trissin,1
Are these normal rates do you know?,RonInDune,1
Cause I never actually bought anything physical from the bungie store,RonInDune,1
Last time I got the grimoire from amazon at half the cost,RonInDune,1
"Oh, I don't know! I don't think I've bought anything from the bungie store",Trissin,1
Shipping was okay for me I guess the last time I ordered from them,Oathbreaker,1
Hmm,RonInDune,1
See all this was much easier when I was in India,RonInDune,1
The shops just refused to sell at all,RonInDune,1
Lol,Trissin,1
Anyone down for grinding Strange Terrain for a bit?,RonInDune,1
Also finish up the ||Rose quest step||,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune you still up for Strange Terrain?,Thawxtem,1
Sure,RonInDune,1
Gimme a sec to log in,Thawxtem,1
We'll need one more,RonInDune,1
"Also, for lore hunters, I think ||using Rose, even the unfinished version, gives lore drops. Just like Thorn||",RonInDune,1
"Also for lore hunters, Tangled Shore is flashpoint, which unlocks some lore for Chronicler title for this week only",Thawxtem,1
@RonInDune mind entering chat?,Thawxtem,1
"RonInDune and Thawxtem are in fireteam chat, ready to do strange terrain, but we need 1 more",Thawxtem,1
@WookieeEater Icarus?,Trissin,1
IT WORKS WITH BENEVOLENT DAWN!!!!!!!!,Buttkikker,1
Holy crap,Trissin,1
Congrats btw!,Trissin,1
gg ez,Pentan,1
dawnblades have infinte grenades now,Pentan,1
"going to see spider man, i'll let ya'll know how it is",Pentan,1
i'm sure it's great tho,Pentan,1
Make sure to buy some glimmer from him,RonInDune,1
😂 that's the dumbest joke i've heard this week but i actually laughed,Pentan,1
good stuff,Pentan,1
Hey anyone down for grinding Strange terrain nightfall for a bit?,RonInDune,1
With me and @Thawxtem,RonInDune,1
I can help,Arixama,1
Perfect thanks a lot ari!,RonInDune,1
Let me finish this forge and I'm ready,Thawxtem,1
We're Clan Level 5!!!!!!,RonInDune,1
Time for getting ALL THE CATALYSTS!,RonInDune,1
wait what does the level 5 perk do exactly?,Pentan,1
if it gives you catalysts that's actually busted,Pentan,1
Increases Crucble and strike catalyst drops when doing them with a clanmate,RonInDune,1
that's pretty nice,Pentan,1
Someone on reddit said it's a 30% increase but I don't know how that works,RonInDune,1
@Buttkikker that's a good game you got there. before Penitent Tangerine my name on all my platforms was either BloonsDestroyer or Bloons113744 since i was like 10 years old,Pentan,1
its fun,Buttkikker,1
coop just came out so im playing a ton,Buttkikker,1
What kind of game is it?,RonInDune,1
tower defense and strategy primarily,Buttkikker,1
i suppose,Buttkikker,1
yeah its really well made for a tower defence game,max?,1
"huh I'll try it out then, the only tower defence I played for any stretch was Sanctum 2",RonInDune,1
defense*,max?,1
yeah i recommend it,max?,1
"for those that don't know, bloons tower defense (btd) started out as a flash game on ninja kiwi. other sites hosted it like coolmathgames so as kids most of us played it during computer time at school. i think btd4 was the last flash version of the game and btd5 and 6 are both steam games",Pentan,1
5 was both,Buttkikker,1
"looks like it's part of the summer sale. btd6 is 30% off, but you could probably get it cheaper on g2a or kinguin if anyone was interested",Pentan,1
Btd was my childhood,Trissin,1
I think I started with 2,Trissin,1
"Hey so I think @WookieeEater asked me yesterday, but here's a complete collection of all the lore books from Forsaken in a neat, well-formatted pdf file:",RonInDune,1
||https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqbBrqa9oh_ZuWE9hdObpAw8CCW8oYFW/view?usp=sharing||,RonInDune,1
Anyone down to farm strange terrain maybe this weekend?,Matos,1
Anyone on the Lumina step wher you have to do activities with Rose equipped?,RonInDune,1
I'd load into lake of shadows. I know I did and ended up running into a fireteam of 2 doing it that I was able to join up with and finish that step,Arixama,1
Good idea that,RonInDune,1
The step after is super easy too,Arixama,1
Nice,RonInDune,1
im trying to get the 200 runes slotted before the thing is patched,Trissin,1
but it's slowwwww,Trissin,1
What're you at?,Arixama,1
Currently 96,Trissin,1
I'm on 91,RonInDune,1
But I only have 2 slots lol,Trissin,1
You got a few more days. How you doing on imperials?,Arixama,1
Low :(((,Trissin,1
Oh dear,Arixama,1
What do I need Imperials for?,Trissin,1
To kill the stormcloaks,RonInDune,1
(also to upgrade chalice to 3rd slot),RonInDune,1
^,Arixama,1
kill stormcloaks? What,Trissin,1
Makes the 200 go faster,Arixama,1
Skyrim joke 🤣,Arixama,1
Ouuuu lmao,Trissin,1
Hmm so I had an interesting rumble game,RonInDune,1
Literally all bots,RonInDune,1
Wow,Trissin,1
That's crazy,Trissin,1
Did you get the triumph trissin?,RonInDune,1
I'll do some mengerie with you later otherwise,RonInDune,1
"No not yet, I went to go take a shower lol",Trissin,1
I think I'm at 140 or something now,Trissin,1
That pretty close!,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I'll get it before it's patched I think",Trissin,1
"I'm done for today but I might be on tomorrow or something, we'll see",Trissin,1
When does it get patched?,RonInDune,1
next reset,Trissin,1
I'll grind it out tomorrow then,RonInDune,1
the 9th,Trissin,1
Perfect,RonInDune,1
I'm actually pretty close to shadow!,Trissin,1
a lot closer than I expected,Trissin,1
Oh woow,RonInDune,1
"I'm still yet to do heroic menagerie though, so I don't know how difficult that will be. Do you need to 3 man it for the title?",Trissin,1
Noope,RonInDune,1
oh what,Trissin,1
Just need to kill all 3 bosses without anyone dying,RonInDune,1
ohh that's not bad at all,Trissin,1
okay cool,Trissin,1
damn i'm also yet to run crown this week... gotta do that 3 times before the reset,Trissin,1
hope i can pick up tarrabah,Trissin,1
We'll see if I can get it before you Trissin,Oathbreaker,1
You're on,Trissin,1
Can we do a couple of Crown runs this weekend? I really want the final Chronicon lore piece!,RonInDune,1
Hmm I didn't know The Big Show was a hunter main. This changes everything.,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/WWETheBigShow/status/1136739551534358536,RonInDune,1
i'm down for crown,Pentan,1
"good news: I ordered an SSD, and if all goes as planned I shall no longer have the potato computer!",Thawxtem,1
I don't think I'll be able to run Crown until monday,Trissin,1
but good luck you guys!,Trissin,1
ssds are life,Pentan,1
sadly like 2/3 of the load times in destiny are server related,Pentan,1
"but i only very rarely have to load new zones when sparrowing around on ssd, and spawning in out of orbit after the ships fly down is instantaneous. those are the 2 big differences i think",Pentan,1
"also some menu stuff probably, like checking different parts of your inventory and character screens",Pentan,1
although that might be in RAM 24/7,Pentan,1
Anybody for a Nightfall?,Samakain,1
Ooooh next week is mayhem,Trissin,1
Time to pull out the colony,Trissin,1
"Also, not sure if you're still looking @Samakain but I just logged in",Trissin,1
Gimme 5 and i'd love to,Samakain,1
Ready to go whenever bud.,Samakain,1

Citadel is hands down worst map in the game,Oathbreaker,1
Lol getting lumina bugged out my kinetic slot,RonInDune,1
It's now empty,RonInDune,1
what happens if you switch to kinetic?,Pentan,1
It equips,Arixama,1
if all of your kinetic slots are full it adds one for it,Buttkikker,1
Holy crap this nova clip I just found on Reddit,Trissin,1
😂 😂 😂,Pentan,1
those things are relentless 😂,Pentan,1
So I've been farming Beloved and is no distractions/moving target with drop mag/extended barrell good enough to keep?,RonInDune,1
"Also have a snapshot sights/rampage, but that doesn't seem right",RonInDune,1
Maybe take a look at this? https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/06/29/the-god-rolls-you-should-be-farming-before-destiny-2s-menagerie-chest-dies/,Thawxtem,1
disagree with the shotty roll tho,Buttkikker,1
Hmm,RonInDune,1
Also @Trissin just finished the Rolling Deep triumph for 200 runes slotted,RonInDune,1
Probably shouldn't have done that during blackout but whatever,RonInDune,1
we gonna raid any time soon? need me some crown stuff,Pentan,1
I'm good monday,Trissin,1
If not a raid then do we have people for a heroic menagerie?,RonInDune,1
im down,Buttkikker,1
About to do scrims 😦,Oathbreaker,1
You guys could probably do a raid as well I think !,Trissin,1
"So there was one extra person in the scrims, so I've stepped out. Would anyone be interested in doing a Mindbenders 100k Nightfall? Trying to farm without the 100k bonus makes me sad because of RNG being cruel",Oathbreaker,1
I can join in in about 10 minutes,RonInDune,1
Sounds good,Oathbreaker,1
Might have a group,Oathbreaker,1
finally finished the 200 runes triumph,Trissin,1
Hmm.. how do you get the opulent menagerie armor?,Trissin,1
Is it a recipe?,Trissin,1
Yeah,RonInDune,1
"ah okay, I see",Trissin,1
https://imgur.com/gallery/NRvSeJQ,RonInDune,1
"ooh okay, thank you!",Trissin,1
"Bottom row, not the exodus down stufd",Arixama,1
"So I need the armor, a few weapons, and the flawless heroic menagerie bosses, and next week's crown challenge",Trissin,1
Ooh what was this week's challenge?,RonInDune,1
I think that'll be it for shadow!,Trissin,1
Dang man,RonInDune,1
This week's challenge is total victory,Trissin,1
"So that's for the 3rd encounter, the deception",Trissin,1
I'm pretty sure you have to break the deception's shield 5 times in a single damage phase,Trissin,1
(anarchy mwahahaha),Trissin,1
Oh okay then I'm definietly doing it with you on Monday lol,RonInDune,1
lool yes let's do it,Trissin,1
World's first shadow let's go!,RonInDune,1
😄 gotta wait for the heroic menagerie flawless bosses though,Trissin,1
"Also for the menagerie, after grinding for so many hours, it honetly felt like the charts were much easier to use than the app",RonInDune,1
Like I can see what going on here here at a glimpse: https://imgur.com/a/U1b3PfP,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I think so too",Trissin,1
ron why can i not help but read all of your messages in your voice,Pentan,1
lol thanks,RonInDune,1
i don't think there's a single other person on the planet that i read their messages in their voice,Pentan,1
no one comes to mind anyway,Pentan,1
my brain really goes out of it's way to to weird shit to me without me signing a consent form,Pentan,1
Oh man I was looking at GuardianCon footage and there's so many easter eggs!,RonInDune,1
"Lots of exotics hidden everywhere, according to reddit.",RonInDune,1
"like someone found ""no time to explain""",RonInDune,1
:o,Trissin,1
I saw photos of the new exotic lmg,Trissin,1
"don't ask me why i played during the halloween event and didn't get thunderlord, because i don't have an answer to that question",Pentan,1
"i can confirm, however, that it will not drop from fated engrams",Pentan,1
@Pentan does that mean you have to get it from just random exotic drops??,Trissin,1
"Also, not sure if people have seen the announcement for Bungie Day and upcoming moments of triumph: http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/47975",Trissin,1
"@Trissin yup, world drops only",Pentan,1
Guys you can get Hive Armaments from the menagerie!!!,RonInDune,1
Get tae farming,RonInDune,1
WHAT,Trissin,1
OH MY GOD.,Trissin,1
oh wow,Buttkikker,1
It's from power and efficiency 3,RonInDune,1
Holy crap,Trissin,1
Only off powerful drops though,Arixama,1
Ohhh,Trissin,1
So nine shots at it a week plus raid drops,Arixama,1
That's still pretty good,Trissin,1
Yeah cause there are only so many mods available,RonInDune,1
Wish there was something like this for the fallen,RonInDune,1
You can get fallen armaments from scourge,Trissin,1
They're really useful lol,Trissin,1
Yeah but I've done scourge thousands and thousands of time and still haven't got any,RonInDune,1
I got my first set of taken armaments pretty recently,Trissin,1
"Ok checking raid report i've done it twice, but eh close enough",RonInDune,1
Looool,Trissin,1
I really want the sparrow,Trissin,1
"Not only does it look cool, but it's actually better than other ones too",Trissin,1
So the only things I want left from Menagerie is armor,Oathbreaker,1
I still haven't completed the race section even once,RonInDune,1
:o sword @Oathbreaker ?,Trissin,1
Managed to get a Quickdraw/Snapshot Beloved,Oathbreaker,1
THE HELL IS WITH ALL YOU GUYS AND SWORDS,Oathbreaker,1
NO,Oathbreaker,1
NEVER,Oathbreaker,1
@Arixama,Trissin,1
I HAVE POCKET DAWNBLADE AND THAT'S THE ONLY SWORD I'LL EVER *WANT* TO USE,Oathbreaker,1
LMAOO,Trissin,1
But I'm pretty sure you need the sword for the collections badge,Trissin,1
and you need that for Shadow,Trissin,1
_and also hey it's not a bad sword so_,Trissin,1
"Shadow requires a sword? No thanks, I'll pass",Oathbreaker,1
lool,Trissin,1
It's for completing heroic managerie,Arixama,1

Swords rule! Guns drool!,RonInDune,1
Have you guys seen anything about vicious circle?,Arixama,1
what's vicious circle?,Trissin,1
The rooster teeth thing?,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, basically four people are fighting to collect 75 things, and one person plays a giant chicken monster trying to kill all of them.",Arixama,1
"Either everyone gets killed by the chicken and the chicken wins, or one person is able to evac and win the round. Rinse and repeat for 5 rounds.",Arixama,1
"Hmm, looks kinda like a mixture of Evolve and Overwatch",RonInDune,1
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfhJHM1HLzU||,RonInDune,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
OH RIGHT,Arixama,1
"If you die, you can still go out and kill the other players and take over their bodies",Arixama,1
"It looks real fun, but I didn't actually get a chance to play it",Arixama,1
@RonInDune Tomorrow I'll be doing my strnage terrain farming if you're still up for it,Matos,1
"Ari helped me and thawx grind it out already so I'm good, but I can help you!",RonInDune,1
Also I'd really love to do the raid and the challenge tomorrow,RonInDune,1
"^
Yep, I'm still on for that. When are people free?",Trissin,1

"I am possibly available, I'll have to see how my connection is at the hotel and when we get there",Arixama,1
why is getting blue runes so difficult,Trissin,1
are they extra rare or something?,Trissin,1
I asked that at the beginning; I believe it’s because they give you the new/rarer gear,Thawxtem,1
I just want a good Erentil Bungie,Oathbreaker,1
Is that so much to ask?,Oathbreaker,1
doing strange terrain farm if anyone is down,Matos,1
Alright I'm logging in now for the raid!,RonInDune,1
Do we have enough?,Trissin,1
im ready to go,Buttkikker,1
"Ari's online, so it seems we have 4",RonInDune,1
but as far as i know were short,Buttkikker,1
@PC Crown of Sorrow + Challenge!,Trissin,1
"Hesitant to join any Crown of Sorrows till Trissin gets his Terrabah, till he gets one I don't do Crown.... I remember what he said about me and potentially getting Anarchy before him monkaS",Oathbreaker,1
LOL,Trissin,1
Thawxtem and Ron both have it,Trissin,1
hahahaha,Trissin,1
It's ok I'll personally make sure he doens't get one,RonInDune,1
Yeah but you didn't say anything about kicking them if they got raid exotics before you,Oathbreaker,1
I have 4 other people who heard you say that about me 😃,Oathbreaker,1
"it's all good oath, i got my anarchy",Trissin,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
hahaha,Trissin,1
if youre busy tonight or if you just dont feel like joining its all good lol,Trissin,1
no obligations or anything,Trissin,1
"(If I wasn't clear I'm joking)

~~not really~~",Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah maybe, had a long shift today but might be able to join",Oathbreaker,1
I want to finish this managerie run I'm doing quick to make sure I'm actually stable,Arixama,1
lol all good,Trissin,1
btw do you need the bounty for the challenge or do you get the triumph regardless,Buttkikker,1
I believe you need to turn in the bounty to get the triumph,Trissin,1
ok good to know,Buttkikker,1
Just turned on my computer after putting in SSD for the first time,Thawxtem,1
i trust it was enlightening,Pentan,1
"Well, all I’ve done is slot it in. It’s still blank. I still have to re-install battle.net on it in order to use it for Destiny, yes?",Thawxtem,1
Did you have to fully reinstall windows?,Arixama,1
"Hmm, maybe it'd be better to do another time",Trissin,1
The raid?,RonInDune,1
Yeah,Trissin,1
Man I really want the challenge lol,RonInDune,1
Do we have 5?,RonInDune,1
"Not sure, I think it depends on thawx's computer",Trissin,1
Worst case scenario is we can do the challenge the next time it comes around,Trissin,1
what challenge?,Jump,1
This week's challenge for crown of sorrow,Trissin,1
I can just load slow Destiny I guess. Just a little hyped about new drive,Thawxtem,1
You can just move destiny to the new hard drive,Arixama,1
"""You can just copy paste the destiny folder on the SSD, and locate the install folder afterwards from the bnet launcher.""",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, you should just be able to migrate D2 over to the new drive no issue",Oathbreaker,1
According to reddit,RonInDune,1
I've played off of an external hard drive before,Arixama,1
"Yeah it's a simple move, nothing can possibly go wrong",RonInDune,1
If thawxtem joins us we've got 5,Trissin,1
"If Oath joins, then 6?",RonInDune,1
That would be correct,Trissin,1
Seems that we don't have enough people,Trissin,1
I think i'm just gonna log off for tonight,Trissin,1
ok night,Buttkikker,1
Ah well we'll try again this weekend,RonInDune,1
G night,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, sounds good",Trissin,1
"Sorry, been messing around with my keyboard",Oathbreaker,1
If you guys want a 6th I'll be in,Oathbreaker,1
Oh,Trissin,1
@Thawxtem @Arixama are you guys good to join?,Trissin,1
1 min. If this doesn’t work I’ll just join on and save drive for later,Thawxtem,1
"I should be able to, just won't be able to talk.",Arixama,1
That's fine,Trissin,1
Go ahead and join up on me when youre ready then,Trissin,1
"Yeah it's all good, we did nightfalls without voice after all",RonInDune,1
What class is needed?,Oathbreaker,1
"I don't think it matters too much, as long as we have 1 warlock we are ok",Trissin,1
Dibs,Thawxtem,1
I'll go Titan then,RonInDune,1
I'll also be running warlock,Arixama,1
We're in the voice channel ari,Trissin,1
@Thawxtem see this: https://www.bungie.net/en/Forums/Post/239471195,RonInDune,1
"ship load times are server loads,and after that is hard drive based",Arixama,1
"so when we were running nightfalls the other night, i had a black screen for a bit while we were waiting for you to load in",Arixama,1
"ship load times will be pretty much the same, but after that your zone load time will definitely be improved",Arixama,1
Does that translate to strikes as well?,Thawxtem,1
"partially.  once the ships zoom down to the planet, thats when youll see the improved load times",Arixama,1

||It's a chest by Werner not one of the main ones||,Oathbreaker,1

holy crap,Trissin,1
"Very spoilerific: ||To start Bad Juju""You need to complete and place a total of 18 tributes in the tribute hall - including the 5 doggo tributes you get by filling the hall.

||Such a weird looking gun: ||,RonInDune,1
wow,Trissin,1
||people have already acquired it??||,Trissin,1
Yeah,RonInDune,1
||It's no outbreak sadly||,RonInDune,1
||I'll try to get that done soon then||,Trissin,1
||I hope it's as good as it was in d1||,Trissin,1
"||Not meant to be a boss killer, it's always been meant for hard add clear||",Oathbreaker,1
"||Requires a **lot** of planetary mats though damn, no way I'm finish the gun and the catalyst anytime soon||",RonInDune,1
"||oh crap, how many mats are we talking here||",Trissin,1
!spider,Trissin,1
||A stupid amount. Like thousands. But if you do the 4 bounties Calus offers it lowers the cost by a percent per bounty.||,Oathbreaker,1
||holy crap||,Trissin,1
Yeah DIM's down as well,RonInDune,1
!dance,Arixama,1
||Got it! It feels realllyyyy goood :))||,Trissin,1
Holy cow,RonInDune,1
Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
Amazing did you really have so many mats???,RonInDune,1
I had a lot of tribute hall stuff already,Trissin,1
thats pretty cool,Jump,1
Oh man can get some people to just run all the raid once today? That gives some tributes I think,RonInDune,1
i dont think u have to do it all in one day,Jump,1
and im pretty sure those are retrospective,Jump,1
I know but ..........,RonInDune,1
?,Jump,1
I want it now lol,RonInDune,1
^^^,Trissin,1
LOL,Jump,1
i mean id be down to run a few not sure about all,Jump,1
it looks really cool in game,Trissin,1
wat armor set is that?,Jump,1
are those transmats?,Jump,1
or ornaments,Jump,1
rather,Jump,1
The armor is from Y1 solstice of heroes,Trissin,1
"I just did some testing with ||bad juju||, it's kind of insane.",Trissin,1
ahh,Jump,1
im excited to see wat the solstice armour is gonnebe thise year,Jump,1
"||So here's how it is. The string of curses perk stacks up to 5x, and the more stacks you have, the more super energy generated per kill.||",Trissin,1
"|| Naturally I went to the thrallway to see how strong it is. I popped my super and then wiped to reset my super bar to 0. I cleared 2 waves of shadow thrall in 27 seconds, and my super was full.||",Trissin,1
"|| I counted 31 kills, but this was all at 5x string of curses (except for the first 4 kills, of course)||",Trissin,1
"Hmm, wonder if masterworking improves that even more",RonInDune,1
I really wonder what the catalyst will do,Trissin,1
It's already very strong,Trissin,1
"Gladd's about to get it, I'll check and tell you",RonInDune,1
wait how do you get it,Trissin,1
what,Trissin,1
45 tributes,RonInDune,1
||go talk to mecha calus||,RonInDune,1
that's not too bad. I'll get that done soon,Trissin,1
@Jump spoiler tags,Trissin,1
Its a spoiler?,Jump,1
wait wut,Jump,1
||Is bad juju the new weapon?||,Jump,1
||so the catalyst extends the duration of string of curses||,RonInDune,1
I JUST GOT UP AND MISSED THIS,Buttkikker,1
WHY BUNGIE WHY,Buttkikker,1
@Trissin ||people are saying there's a secret firefly effect on bad juju did you notice that?||,RonInDune,1
||https://clips.twitch.tv/EntertainingSpikyHareNerfBlueBlaster||,RonInDune,1
||the catalyst makes string of curses last a couple seconds more||,RonInDune,1
seems kinda underwhelming,RonInDune,1
might be godly in the crucible though hmm,RonInDune,1
But also generates orbs of light and gives you more time between kills if you need it,Arixama,1
yea i hope its good for crucible,Jump,1
Can't wait to get home and grind it out!,RonInDune,1
for sure,Jump,1
"It's designed for ad clear, I don't think it's gonna be popular for pvp",Trissin,1
the bounties arent that bad,Jump,1
sad,Jump,1
well a ||pulse rifle|| for pve is still good with me,Jump,1
Also I didn't get the random firefly to proc @RonInDune,Trissin,1
maybe its a bug?,Jump,1
^^,RonInDune,1
I doubt that,Trissin,1
We'll see I guess,Trissin,1
had an animation that ive not seen before,Buttkikker,1
I mean i have yet to get the weapon and try it out,Jump,1
so we'll see,Jump,1
you guys really like your black ink don't you,Pentan,1
nO sPOilErS,Trissin,1
yikes...,Jump,1
what exactly is a yike,Pentan,1
and why are they only seen in groups,Pentan,1
So the With Both Hands challenge is pretty easy,RonInDune,1
what do you need to do?,Buttkikker,1
One person shoot one hand during final boss,RonInDune,1
So the two people in each team just shoots one hand each before dps phase,RonInDune,1
And what about during damage phase?,Trissin,1
"Everyone shoots one hand I think, but it's a bit confusing still",RonInDune,1
||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8SrJgVKwA0||,RonInDune,1
Okay I got it,Trissin,1
Can we try tonight?,RonInDune,1
so for the new triumphs (specificly the collections and triumph score ones) do you need to do it again if you have already done what it says?,Buttkikker,1
im down to try @RonInDune,Jump,1
Yeah if we get enough people we can teach @Jump crown,Trissin,1
im down,Buttkikker,1
thank you sir,Jump,1
im gonna power level now then,Jump,1
You're fine,Trissin,1
I think 710+ when you start is fine,Trissin,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
exotics dont have random rolls right,Jump,1
armor does,Buttkikker,1
so if i have a duplicate i should dismantle it right?,Jump,1
oh,Jump,1
rip,Jump,1
Its probably not going to matter in September anyway,Arixama,1
thats true,Jump,1
i havent really bothered with armor rolls as i have with weapon rolls,Jump,1
Can we do 9:30 for the raid?,Jump,1
I can’t make 9 even 9:30 is a bit of a question mark,Jump,1
@Trissin,Jump,1
"Time is flexible, we'll see if that works for others",Trissin,1
I'm down whenever,RonInDune,1
OK the solstice vehicles don't look nearly as good this year,Arixama,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1
There were amazing last time round,RonInDune,1
I guess they're the moments of triumph ones technically,Arixama,1
Has the armour been upgraded?,RonInDune,1
"Solstice stuff isn't available yet, but the final tier this year has a slightly different model",Arixama,1
Ok let’s do a little past 9:30,Jump,1
Any chance you wanna join us @Nahkriin ?,Trissin,1
So are we starting an hour from now?,RonInDune,1

What was the 540 trials pulse?,Trissin,1
Blast Furnace and Go Figure don't even have drop off except in PvE instances (with the exception of maybe 2 lanes),Oathbreaker,1
I forgot the name,Trissin,1
Darkest Before,Oathbreaker,1
that,Trissin,1

"i had on geomags, but other than that yeah. id suggest using all opulence stuff if you can, because for some reason oath didnt get it and he had all but 1 calus themed as well, so it might be finicky for some reason",Arixama,1
Ive got three of us that havent done any of the new raids and need to do them for Triumphs if you ahve room for raids,Sabre,1
I''m sure we do!,RonInDune,1

"been helping someone else, what's been going on here?",Thawxtem,1

fyi: trying to get Luna,Thawxtem,1
either that or I need a lot of help getting to fabled,Thawxtem,1
me and ron are going to be doing some comp if you would like to join us,Buttkikker,1
when?,Thawxtem,1
some point tommorow,Buttkikker,1
"mmm kay, I'm going to a movie with family, but other than that I should be free",Thawxtem,1
ok cool,Buttkikker,1
"also, hand cannon suggestions?",Thawxtem,1
austringer is very good and versatile,Buttkikker,1
but other than that i think its more based on what you have because it can be hard to get some of the hand cannons,Buttkikker,1
for example spare rations ive heard is good but its hard to farm for,Buttkikker,1
"thanks, I'll look at what I've got tomorrow. good night!",Thawxtem,1
night!,Buttkikker,1
Man i'd kill to be able to solo que in strikes,Samakain,1
"Austringer, Ace, Thorn, Waking Vigil, Jack Queen King 3 are kind of my go to PVP hand cannons",Oathbreaker,1
I highly recommend Ace is you don't normally use hand cannons,Oathbreaker,1
"It's got 5 perks rolled into one single gun. 

Third eye, High Cal Rounds, Firefly, Outlaw, Kill Clip for 6 bullets rather than 4 seconds",Oathbreaker,1
"It has the longest range of any hand cannon barring Not Forgotten on it's new Mag Howl bullet, some of the highest flinch values in the game due to High Cal, has extremely high bullet magnetism and aim assist",Oathbreaker,1
Austringer you need a fairly specific roll to be a good hand cannon for PvP. Hammer Forged or Full Bore/Accurized Rounds/Eye of the Storm/Rangefinder or Opening shot with Range MW,Oathbreaker,1
"Thorn has different recoil but if you get used to it, the gun becomes super lethal in lower comp levels.",Oathbreaker,1
"Waking Vigil has maybe 2 usuable rolls, period. All are gonna need Sureshot/Ricochet Rounds/Range MW. Your combo is basically gonna need to be Zen Moment and something else in this slot like Slideshot or Outlaw for this roll. Basically, where I normally wouldn't recommend Zen Moment on any gun, Waking Vigil has this weird bounce to its recoil that is mitigated by Zen Moment. Your next roll would be something like Opening Shot with Slideshot, Outlaw, or Snapshot sights.",Oathbreaker,1
"Don't bother with Spare Rations, getting Rose from collections is x100000 more time efficient due to how Reckoning weapon drops work. First, it's a layer of RNG to see if you get a gun. Second, it's another layer of RNG to see if you get the gun you want, third it's a layer of RNG to get good perks",Oathbreaker,1
"Last Word is also extremely good within its 25m range before dropoff, the issue is that if you don't know how to use it (tap firing instead of holding down the trigger for the most part), TLW suffers hard from accuracy issues.",Oathbreaker,1
"If anyone has any PvP questions I'd be more than happy to answer them, whether it's about weapon rolls, strategies, armor perks, literally anything.",Oathbreaker,1
"If you guys want gameplay to see what I do when I'm having a good day so you have something to try and learn from, just let me know as well.",Oathbreaker,1
"As I've said a few times, I play way too much PvP for my own sanity.",Oathbreaker,1
"I'll be playing some comp soon as well, gotta climb back up",Trissin,1
"Another small perk of Ace is the radar stay up when you aim, which can be a life changer. 

Wish the snipers did that too but it'd probably be  bit too OP.",RonInDune,1
@Oathbreaker what's your opinion on curated nation of beasts for pvp,Pentan,1
"Better rolls exist. Not the worst gun to use but getting a different roll, such as Hammer Forged, AccRounds, Outlaw, Kill Clip with Range MW is probably gonna be you best bet for Nation",Oathbreaker,1
"It's not bad, but it could be much better.",Oathbreaker,1
whatever i'll take it lol,Pentan,1
i've been using that and ace mostly for pvp as far as hand cannons go,Pentan,1
"Kindled Orchid is also an okay PvP hand cannon, might not be what I prefer but it's a good energy slot option.",Oathbreaker,1
"thanks, i'll look into it the next time i'm on destiny",Pentan,1
No problem,Oathbreaker,1
i'm just sad that blast furnace is a thing now. i have an actual perfect roll on go figure,Pentan,1
"got a pretty good blast furnace now too, but still, sad",Pentan,1
"If you prefer Go Figure, use it. Sometimes it's about the feel of the weapon too.",Oathbreaker,1
nah i definitely prefer my blast furnace. the thing is a laser. i was just proud of my go figure,Pentan,1
It's why I can't stand Kindled Orchid. Something feels off about it. I prefer other Hand Cannons to it for some reason that can't be explained lol,Oathbreaker,1
Fair enough,Oathbreaker,1
the two weapons in question,Pentan,1
"Honestly, could be a slightly better roll if I'm being real nitpicky for both. Go Figure you want Hi-Cal, Outlaw, Kill Clip but the roll you have is decent. Your Blast Furnace.... Not the best. Zen Moment by far is not a good perk on most guns with *some* very slight exceptions. Rampage is okay for PvE but for PvP it's by far miles better. No need to stack to get max damage.",Oathbreaker,1
"like i said, my blast furnace is *alright*",Pentan,1
"Oh yeah, both guns are good, just could be better lol",Oathbreaker,1
I'm a perfectionist so I always look for the best possible rolls and all that unfun theory crafting stuff,Oathbreaker,1
i mean yeah that'd be nice but i just don't have the time and i definitely don't have the luck required to get those rolls,Pentan,1
"i make what i have work pretty damn well for myself i think. like you said, it's about the feel",Pentan,1
Isn't ricochet strictly better than accurized @Oathbreaker ?,Trissin,1
"It gives more range, just doesn't show it on the stat bar",Trissin,1
i looked into that and i don't think so but i'm by no means an expert,Pentan,1
I don't remember if Ricochet can roll on NoB,Oathbreaker,1
I do personally prefer Ricochet,Oathbreaker,1
Give me a second,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah it can't,Oathbreaker,1
I remember seeing it somewhere that ricochet secretly gives more range than accurized,Trissin,1
So that's why you want Acc Rounds,Oathbreaker,1
It does kinda. Like maybe a meter at most. It also slightly increases zoom,Oathbreaker,1
"In theory the pure range roll for Nation of beasts would be Full Bore, AccRounds, Opening Shot, Kill Clip",Oathbreaker,1
good stuff,Pentan,1
Getting that exact roll is a stupid amount of RNG though so,Oathbreaker,1
just wanna be able to re-roll weapons like we did in d1,Pentan,1
I don't want that again.,Oathbreaker,1
yeah i guess it is better now i'm just being lazy,Pentan,1
It would be the part of House of Wolves I hated. Needing to reroll to get the *perfect* roll just to be able to compete.,Oathbreaker,1
wat about better devils?,Jump,1
i quite like that one,Jump,1
still prefer ace over it but still,Jump,1
"hasn't been relevant since season 1 that i've heard, but really i'm no expert",Pentan,1
"There are better options than Better Devils, but regardless, big range roll would be Sureshot, AccRounds, Rangefinder, Opening shot",Oathbreaker,1
anyone wanna run a nightfall,Jump,1
i gotta get the weekly rewards and lumina,Jump,1
Outlaw or Rangefinder are your two best first column perks while Opening Shot or Kill Clip are your two best second column perks,Oathbreaker,1
"So, I discovered that there was lore hidden in the Reckoning. I want to get it all, but I don't want to abandon my teammates. Is there a group here that would be interested in doing Reckoning for lore? Most is still on board the ship, 10 pieces, and it only goes up to tier 2",Thawxtem,1
Oh yeah for sure,RonInDune,1
Plus the Dust lore pieces are fascinating,RonInDune,1
ill join as well,Jump,1
also @Jump I would be willing to do nightfall if you're willing to do the Will of Thousands. I wanted the projection,Thawxtem,1
"@Thawxtem the nightfall exclusive isn't a projection, it's a transmat effect",Trissin,1
"that what I meant, sorry",Thawxtem,1
I know ghost projections didn't exist back then,Thawxtem,1
"So it turns out that going on the ship for the Nine quests still bring up the lore pieces, and the others can be easily obtained without interfering with the Reckoning match",Thawxtem,1

"Eh Scourge doesn't take longer than an hour usually, we can do last wish after",RonInDune,1
Unless something goes terribly wrong,RonInDune,1
"^
Scourge should be pretty quick, I don't mind doing last wish afterwards",Trissin,1
Want to join us in voice @RonInDune ?,Trissin,1
So Drewsky just said there's a crucible cheese with the *tarrabah* where you can self inflict damage so you can instantly get the perk active,RonInDune,1

@Oathbreaker Hey! D2 pvp is stupid.,Matos,1
We keep getting that bug where we don't respawn.,Matos,1
In comp.,Matos,1
"Go to pursuits and see if you can complete a bounty, otherwise try swapping weapons",Oathbreaker,1
I think that's the temporary fix,Oathbreaker,1
Did they fix Lord of wolves?,Matos,1
It's not doing much for me.,Matos,1
You’re joking right?,Pentan,1
I had to sit out the entire last game except the first round and right before I spawn in on the next game my power goes out,Pentan,1
Idk what they broke but that's the current situation,Oathbreaker,1
"And no, Lord of Bullshit still exists",Oathbreaker,1
Do we have enough poeple to run last wish today?,RonInDune,1
Or heroic menagerie,RonInDune,1
im so down for either,Jump,1
"yeah, let's do last wish",Trissin,1

!lfg create,Pentan,1
!spider,Arixama,1
Go get your tributes boiz,Arixama,1
tributes?,Pentan,1
For the tribute hall. The ones that cost planetary materials,Arixama,1
tribute hall?,Pentan,1
The stuff that dropped this week.,Arixama,1
apparently there's some stuff i need to catch up on. i haven't been paying that much attention,Pentan,1
I sadly resorted to cheating and kept the game open on 100 power in the forges and woke up with enough planetary mats to buy all the tributes,RonInDune,1
wait 100 power?,Pentan,1
how does this mat farm work?,Pentan,1
That's not cheating.,Arixama,1
You go on at a low power and the Forge ends before you get kicked for being afk,Arixama,1
"Yeah so go in with as low power as you can, I used my starting damaged traveler's chosen gear",RonInDune,1
You get matched with other powple also AFK farming so noone gets hurt,RonInDune,1
what makes it end quickly?,Pentan,1
Only works for dusklight and data lattice,Arixama,1
The timer on the Forge is only a minute,Arixama,1
"And nobody is doing anything, so it finishes in 1:10, puts you into matchmaking again which resets the timer.",Arixama,1
"My game kept disconnecting so I tried it last night, didn't work 😦",Oathbreaker,1
wait no,Pentan,1
how do i make it show up again,Pentan,1
thanks,Pentan,1
thank you warmind,Pentan,1
you asked for it :BAguns:,Arixama,1
I think warmind is turning into Rasputin,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune @Buttkikker @Arixama @Trissin are we go? i'm in raid chat,Pentan,1
I'll need like 20 more minutes sorry,RonInDune,1

I'm loggin in now,RonInDune,1

I’m down but for later,Jump,1
"maybe @Arixama , dont have an answer for you just yet",Trissin,1
"sorry, I don't think i'll be joining for scourge tonight",Trissin,1
@max? @Jump  have you run scourge before?,Arixama,1
phase has he helped clear adds on map mostly however,Buttkikker,1
yeah,max?,1

Huh someone solo-d Riven,RonInDune,1
i thought gladd did that during revelry,Trissin,1
i guess without those buffs?,Trissin,1

Yeah did it today it seems,RonInDune,1
Never heard of this streamer before though,RonInDune,1
||https://twitter.com/Baxlyy/status/1150568506892550144||,RonInDune,1
@Oathbreaker  how is this for crucible?,Buttkikker,1
(range masterwork hammer forged riffling),Buttkikker,1
"One of the best rolls you can get, hands down.",Oathbreaker,1
"Rangefinder is more consistent than opening shot but OS doesn't give extra zoom, outlaw is always nice and the range trifecta is great.",Oathbreaker,1
I personally think opening shot is  better tbh,Jump,1
As long as you can consistently hit the precision shot,Jump,1
nah i'd much rather have rangefinder,Pentan,1
I guess its a oreference thing,Jump,1
i dont like the extra zoom either,Jump,1
Rangefinder adds maybe 1-2m of additional range. OS matches that and gives extra AA on first shot.,Oathbreaker,1
^,Jump,1
I have Eye of the Storm and OS and it's just dumb the AA I have.,Oathbreaker,1
Hey @Oathbreaker do you know a better handcannon that has a similar recoil and firepattern to the IKELOS handcannon?,Jump,1
AA?,Pentan,1
"Aim Assistance. Really, on PC with M&K it's bullet magnetism",Oathbreaker,1
LOL,Jump,1
True term lmao,Oathbreaker,1
It works,Oathbreaker,1
ah,Pentan,1
"As for the hand cannon, not many 180s left that are ""good""",Oathbreaker,1
"Two immediately come to mind, one is not a big pain but the other is.",Oathbreaker,1
Service Revolver and Trust,Oathbreaker,1
OOF i dont like trust,Jump,1
It doesnt feel as tight as IKELOS,Jump,1
i just really like the recoil on IKELOS,Jump,1
Trust is mediocre but easily farmed from Menagarie. Service Revolver is currently unobtainable due to it being a Season 6 triumph but Bungie are working on it from what I understand.,Oathbreaker,1
okie,Jump,1
thanks!,Jump,1
No problem.,Oathbreaker,1
"Three months ago I would have said Luna's lol but seeing as though it got nuked into oblivion, there's now like 3 180s that are decent",Oathbreaker,1
Yea luna's feels really tight too,Jump,1
i liked it,Jump,1
but BIG rip,Jump,1
They butchered the Magnificent Howl guns.,Oathbreaker,1
Yea,Jump,1
"Absolutely destroyed any use with them, barring the range of Not Forgotten but even then, I'd rather have other less difficult to obtain options.",Oathbreaker,1
Tru,Jump,1
you know Bungie should just introduce the pistol from halo,Jump,1
so OP would solve all the problems,Jump,1
optional scope like no recoil,Jump,1
2 shots hunters,Jump,1
ez pz,Jump,1
The 150rpm archetype is the closest match.,Oathbreaker,1
No hand cannon will 2-tap standalone,Oathbreaker,1
Rampage Duke will,Oathbreaker,1
I believe in halo's  handcannon,Jump,1
#IDontKeepItLoadedSon,Pentan,1
and when i meant hunters i meant covenant hunters XDXD,Jump,1
bitch it one shot hunters,Pentan,1
i remember tht,Jump,1
the first time i saw that i was like why?,Jump,1
Bullet would ricochet off their armor,Oathbreaker,1
That and the sniper would do massive damage because of their bullets ricocheting off the hunter armor as intended but on the inside (where it was not intended to ricochet),Oathbreaker,1
lol,Jump,1
i miss HALO,Jump,1
juju catalyst almost doubles the length of string of curses,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
Did you get the weird firefly explosions ari?,RonInDune,1
Haven't played with it enough yet,Arixama,1
According to reddit you get it between 40 and 150 kill intervals,RonInDune,1
anybody wanna play some crucible?,Pentan,1
"either way, i'll be in voice chat in a few minutes. just hop in and i'll get you in after i finish whatever match i'm playing",Pentan,1
"just now noticed it says published by bungie. idk how long it's been like that, but it feels good to see",Pentan,1
@Pentan  how long are u going to be playing for?,Jump,1
I'd be down to join u later,Jump,1
for the foreseeable future,Pentan,1
But i have to do some work rn and still have to eat dinner,Jump,1
Can u do around 10ish?,Jump,1
absolutely,Pentan,1
Maybe a tad bit later,Jump,1
sounds good,Jump,1
i'm actually gonna do a couple menagerie runs and try to get a better austringer until someone else joins or i run out of runes,Pentan,1
I have to do that too,Jump,1
my austringer has a garbage roll,Jump,1
And i also have to get all the opulent gear still 😦,Jump,1
yeah i haven't gotten any opulent gear. not really worried about it,Pentan,1
Its just for the triumphs Im really behind on them?,Jump,1
When does the tribute hall thing end?,Jump,1
i'm not the person to ask,Pentan,1
i assumed the tribute hall is here to stay though,Pentan,1
huh,Jump,1
somebody please tell me if i'm wrong,Pentan,1
"Yeah Tribute Hall is forever, moments of triumph is temporary",RonInDune,1
"||ALso, apparently a couple of D1 exotics are coming back in shadowkeep||",RonInDune,1

That's a lot of stats,RonInDune,1
OH I GET IT,Arixama,1
"||each mod is going to have a point value similar to scrabble, and then youll have so many points to spend (which looks like it can be upgrades up to 10)||",Arixama,1
||ooooh nice observation!!!||,RonInDune,1
||looks like the point value is determined by mod rarity/power||,Arixama,1
"||greens are 1, blues are 2, purps are 3, but there are also 5 purps||",Arixama,1
Dang Ari well spotted!,RonInDune,1
"||i'd put money on enhancement cores being used to upgrade the energy bar for the armor, since there doesnt seem to be a masterwork slot and the energy bar appears to go up to 10. i wonder if chests will have more energy because they currently have more perks on them?||",Arixama,1

So I just totalled up my play time across destiny versions. I've got over 1200 hours.,Arixama,1
Minus maybe 36 for afk farming mats overnight a couple of times.,Arixama,1
Dang!,RonInDune,1
Anybody want an emblem of the synth?,Arixama,1
Is that the one from buying something from the store?,RonInDune,1
Yup,Arixama,1
"I still haven't received mine from pre ordering the Grimoire Vol 2. I raised an issue with customer service, no help yet...",RonInDune,1
I know it was a seperate email with a link where you have to go download a pdf.,Arixama,1
Huh I hope it didn't get swallowed by the spam filter,RonInDune,1
"From bungie store digital product, and it's a different email address",Arixama,1
You planning on getting a mot shirt?,Arixama,1
Nah shipping is too high,RonInDune,1
What's the shipping?,Arixama,1
It was something ridiculous like $16 for the book,RonInDune,1
Cheapest,RonInDune,1
Book is heavier than a shirt,Arixama,1
Hmm I might look it up then,RonInDune,1
Shipping on my shirt was like 5,Arixama,1

@Trissin want to finish our reckoning for the helmet? my reaper head bounty will expire in 14 hours,Matos,1
@Oathbreaker wats a good roll for the erentil,Jump,1
"Range, range, and more range",Oathbreaker,1
I want to pair it with ace,Jump,1
Did I mention range,Oathbreaker,1
So wat perks rangefinder and?,Jump,1
"Not rangefinder actually, for the theoretical perfect roll",Oathbreaker,1
Hold on I'll get the list lmao,Oathbreaker,1
Oh,Jump,1
Lol,Jump,1
We can run menagerie for it right?,Jump,1
Yes,Oathbreaker,1
Long Range Scope/Projection Fuse or Particle Repeater/Under Pressure/Tap The Trigger is what you want with Range MW,Oathbreaker,1
I basically have that roll with Stability MW instead,Oathbreaker,1
I can hit consistent 45m 1HKOs,Oathbreaker,1
It's dumb,Oathbreaker,1
And that's unbuffed,Oathbreaker,1
So the first one?,Jump,1
That’s insane,Jump,1
Stand in an empowering rift and I would hit 55m shots,Oathbreaker,1
62m is technically possible with empowering and lunafactions but then it comes down to spread,Oathbreaker,1
Huh I actually preferred having backup plan and snapshot sights for the quick takedowns,RonInDune,1
Also an okay roll,Oathbreaker,1
Wat would be the right play style for such a roll?,Jump,1
But backup plan has a weird activation time and fucks with your cadence on non-backup shots,Oathbreaker,1
"Literally play cover, look to get a pick on someone being aggressive",Oathbreaker,1
The idea is to pre-charge and anticipate when someone will push,Oathbreaker,1
Punish accordingly,Oathbreaker,1
Got it 👍,Jump,1
Thanks!,Jump,1
Np,Oathbreaker,1
"Pair with Ace or Thorn, maybe Rose or if you have a good Spare Rations",Oathbreaker,1
Austringer also works,Oathbreaker,1
I like to run ace,Jump,1
Is thorn really that good?,Jump,1
Yes,Oathbreaker,1
Why would u pick thorn over ace?,Jump,1
"With perk active, I believe it 2 taps to the head with someone not at 6 resilience",Oathbreaker,1
Ace you need to keep it out to have perk active,Oathbreaker,1
Yea,Jump,1
Thorn helps with chaining kills and not losing perk,Oathbreaker,1
Got it,Jump,1
"Oh crap, sorry I just saw your message now @Matos , do you still need help with reckoning?",Trissin,1
"I'll be on tomorrow morning if you need, just give me a shout",Trissin,1

how are you gonna call jade a sleeper when cerberus+1 exists,Pentan,1
"rat king, sweet business",Pentan,1
Because those are niche,Oathbreaker,1
Jade on long range maps its legit,Oathbreaker,1
and jade is better than niche,Pentan,1

"i'll take ""only long range"" over niche any day",Pentan,1

rest is not too important,Trissin,1
I'm tired as hell so that may be a dumb question but I'm asking it anyways,Oathbreaker,1
Quick Launch or Hard Launch/Spike Grenades/Field Prep/Quickdraw would probably be the theoretical best roll,Oathbreaker,1
"With a range mw, yeah?",Arixama,1
Velocity,Oathbreaker,1
From memory the higher the velocity the better,Oathbreaker,1
massive f for the other team,Jump,1
wat about the barrel n stuff?,Jump,1

Quick launch/hard launch,Trissin,1
so wats the full roll?,Jump,1

"So it seems like one of the requirements for masterworking solstice gear is a ||200,000 nightfall||",Arixama,1
how do i get solstice gear?,Pentan,1
Ooof,RonInDune,1
Step one is wait for solstice to start,Arixama,1
oops,Trissin,1
!!!!!,Trissin,1
there,Buttkikker,1
Congrats!!!!!,Trissin,1
Niiiiice,Arixama,1
😄,Buttkikker,1
Oh wow congratulations!!!!,RonInDune,1
That's amazing,RonInDune,1
The real question is how many enhancement cores did you gain from it?,Arixama,1
congrats man!,Oathbreaker,1
lol i randomly just got borealis,Jump,1
Nice it's a pretty good one,Arixama,1
"another week, another couple sad retold tale rolls",Pentan,1
what happens if i have an ornament on weapon and i dismantle the weapon?,Jump,1
does the ornament go away permanently,Jump,1
Ornaments are permanently unlocked,Arixama,1
nah it'll still be there if you pull weapon from collections,Pentan,1
ornaments work the way shaders should work,Pentan,1
oh so i dont have to reaquire the ornament seperately?,Jump,1
Nope!,RonInDune,1
The only thing you lose is your kill streak counter if it's masterworked,RonInDune,1
oh so once i get an ornament i should just equip it immediately,Jump,1
theres no point in holding onto it,Jump,1
exactly,Pentan,1
Nah shaders are fine now with the way collections work,Arixama,1
"are they much improved? yes. do they still leave plenty to be desired? yes. am i gonna complain until i don't have to go dig through collections, find the shader, spend legendary shards, and then find the shader again to equip it? yes.",Pentan,1
"Do they need better organization in collections? Yes. If legendary shards were any sort of scarce resource then it'd be a problem that the cost shards, but they're not. Also finding the shader to equip is a non issue after you have it, especially in the scenario you presented because the shader interface armor automatically sorts by newest, so it's the first slot.",Arixama,1
i think right now the biggest problem facing destiny isnt even the content,Jump,1
its the UI,Jump,1
its really really frustrating,Jump,1
too many tabs with multiple panels and a lack or organization,Jump,1
"The only real problem I see with the ui is the pursuits tab, and that's because there's no shortcut to get to it",Arixama,1
Yeah somehow Bungie made one of the best and the worst UIs in gaming,RonInDune,1
"well i still get to bitch about only having 50 inventory slots for shaders, and you can't take that away from me",Pentan,1
ideally i think we should just be able to equip them straight from collections,Pentan,1
I'd like an auto dismantle for picked up shaders.,Arixama,1
Like at this point any shader I pick up gets dismantled and then I just print the ones I want when I want them,Arixama,1
yes please,Pentan,1
also we're never gonna get it but auto dismantle for blues would be great,Pentan,1
at least in d1 they had a chance to be legendary,Pentan,1

"Whoa, lots of people online. Anybody want to run a raid or something?",Trissin,1
Haven't been to do one in a while,Trissin,1
there's a 7 person limit in each channel?,Jump,1
"sorry, they dragged me in here",Thawxtem,1
lol sorry that was me,Trissin,1
u should remove the 7 person limit,Jump,1
especially sincec we r a clan,Jump,1

"That's where I need to shoot, right?",Thawxtem,1
How long does it take an inexperienced person to get 300 pvp sniper kills?,Thawxtem,1
depends on how many bots you match with in rumble,Arixama,1
finally perfected the Chalice,Thawxtem,1
Dang congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
Now we gotta do the heroic mengaerie,RonInDune,1
First I need Izanagi's Burden. I want to get that before doing heroic,Thawxtem,1
"Yeah good idea, what do you have left?",RonInDune,1
stuck finding a rare bounty :nkoCry:,Thawxtem,1
Oh noo yeah that's super annoying,RonInDune,1
Don't forget to do the augmented weapon bounties as well!,RonInDune,1
https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48006,Arixama,1
Armor looks good! The super grindy sparrow seems okay too,Trissin,1
Yeah this is pretty god :||the Solstice of Heroes armor set the first armor 2.0 set you will receive||,RonInDune,1
you can pair the sparrow with the ship from last year,Arixama,1
indeed,Trissin,1
im excited to start grinding,Trissin,1
"It starts next week, yeah?",Arixama,1
yep!,Trissin,1

That's pretty good,RonInDune,1
"""pretty good""",Arixama,1
thats almost perfect,Arixama,1
"after tonight i won't be on for about 4-5 days, just fyi",Pentan,1

||The Laser Tag Weekend emblem is sooo good||,RonInDune,1

I like it a lot,Trissin,1
I'm sad I wasn't there,RonInDune,1
I'm glad they're releasing an emblem for it,Trissin,1
What??,Trissin,1
Oh noooo,Trissin,1
wish I could have been there,Thawxtem,1
^^,RonInDune,1
honestly sounds like fun. almost even a clan activity,Thawxtem,1
I didn't have Destiny then (and only even had a vague idea about its existence),RonInDune,1
We could do a clan event with only laser guns,RonInDune,1
Except Oath is only allowed swords,RonInDune,1

Yo I love the new wolfenstein,Arixama,1
Is it a DLC to 2 or a full new game?,RonInDune,1
Full game. Similar to like far cry blood dragon. $30 for new areas and content but same engine,Arixama,1
"Cool I never got around to playing 2, but 1 was amazing. Especially when you randomly ||go to the moon!||",RonInDune,1
"I'd say definitely play through 2, especially if you've got the game pass ultimate subscription because it's on there.",Arixama,1
"Huh I might try it out, I remember AssCreed Origins launched at the same time as Wolf 2 and took all my attention",RonInDune,1
"I don't remember why, but when new blood first came out I watched a playthrough of it and it didn't really catch my interest, but then I picked it up for some reason and loved it.",Arixama,1
They do a really good job of melding a good story with over the top fps gameplay,Arixama,1
"Yo, Youngblood is Rad. I can confirm.",Samakain,1
Pin finally came in today!,Thawxtem,1
Oh woah they look great!,RonInDune,1
Very nice!,RonInDune,1
"When I get the last Mars weapon from Ana, I’ll be ordering 2 more",Thawxtem,1
Huh apparently longer shotgun barrel lengths gives a minuscle damage bonus,RonInDune,1
It's dumb,Oathbreaker,1
But it's such a *Bungie* thing,Oathbreaker,1
Chap ornament gives like 4 extra damage at 14m which allows for longer range 1-shots,Oathbreaker,1
It's why Botheration maps people while being absolutely mediocre,Oathbreaker,1
I'm so tired of being put in Izanami forge by myself,Trissin,1
The other forges I can handle solo,Trissin,1
but Izanami is the only one that I can't,Trissin,1
just because of how it's laid out,Trissin,1
PaY tO wIn,Arixama,1
We can do it together as a caln later,RonInDune,1
I need izanagi's burden kills for the triumph,RonInDune,1
ohh yeah,Trissin,1
Is anyone going to be playing IB around 10:00 CT tonight? I’ve just about had it with random groups,Thawxtem,1
Apparently No Feelings with box is crazy @Oathbreaker ?,Trissin,1
I'm very interested,Trissin,1
Three tap if procced,Oathbreaker,1
But it's a scout so just about everything beats it in the sandbox,Oathbreaker,1
"Not a horrible pick though, right situation it's downright scary",Oathbreaker,1
Are there any legnedary scouts that are as stable as MIDA?,RonInDune,1
"I like the raid scout, but it feels like it has way less impact",RonInDune,1
Yeah but it's a 180 rpm,Trissin,1
That can 3 tap,Trissin,1
0.67 ttk,Trissin,1
Right?,Trissin,1
got redrix finally,Buttkikker,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
That's probably the longest grind in the game!,RonInDune,1
definitely up there,Buttkikker,1
just glad to have the collection for crucible done mostly,Buttkikker,1
"has anyone here tried flawless Crown yet? if so, know which strategy might be best/worked for you?",thegoaliebear,1
Did Flawless crown the other night. Took us 2 tries. We did GLs at final boss with a Well right underneath him,Oathbreaker,1
"And yeah Trissin, those values sound right",Oathbreaker,1
team composition?,thegoaliebear,1
"I think it was 1 Titan, 2 Hunters, and 3 Warlocks",Oathbreaker,1
"Titan for melting point, Hunters were just kinda there, Warlocks for well",Oathbreaker,1
cool👍,thegoaliebear,1
"I think team composition isn't actually very important, you just need minimum 3 warlocks",Trissin,1
"And yeah, definitely grenade launchers for damage. (+ 1 tractor)",Trissin,1
Just fyi to whom it may concern im going to be gone for about a week,Buttkikker,1
but after that way to much solstice for my own well being,Buttkikker,1
Let us know if you need any help with the solstice gear!,Trissin,1
will do,Buttkikker,1
Grinding activities are always better in a group,Trissin,1
definitely,Buttkikker,1
"Oh my god, auto rifles are SO BAD",Trissin,1
There's nothing worse,Trissin,1
For the ib quest?,Arixama,1
Yes,Trissin,1
Cerberus is your friend,Arixama,1
I don't think there's anything I wouldn't use over an auto rifle,Trissin,1
Cerberus????,Trissin,1
I've been using suros,Trissin,1
and valakadyn,Trissin,1
and ringing nail,Trissin,1
"Shotgun type damage, auto rifle class",Arixama,1
hmm,Trissin,1
i'll give it a go,Trissin,1
so far it's not doing too hot,Trissin,1
So apparently i was already at like 90% when I put cerberus on,Trissin,1
wait how did i leave for 48 hours and suddenly cerberus is relevant,Pentan,1
someone please explain,Pentan,1
Iron Banner AR final blows,Trissin,1
"I was struggling with suros, ari recommended cerberus",Trissin,1
turns out it didn't really matter because I only needed like 5 more,Trissin,1
lol,Pentan,1
Dunno if cereberus is any good though,Trissin,1
"Everyone I was with said Suros. Also, asking for friend, anyone know if you can still get MIDA if you skipped the main story?",Thawxtem,1
i'm sure you can,Pentan,1
i don't see why not,Pentan,1
You just gotta do the earth blue flag mission,Arixama,1
*purple,Pentan,1
There was no flag mission on the map,Thawxtem,1
Have you talked to devrim?,Arixama,1
I will advise them to do so. Anyone up for IB? I just need a 2 or more win streak so I can cheese the final quest,Thawxtem,1
i just need stupid sword kills,Pentan,1
it's actually the worst,Pentan,1
"pshht it's not that bad, nothing's worse than AR kills",Trissin,1
"don't forget you can whack people with the hilt for kills too, they don't have to be powered kills",Trissin,1
that's even worse 😂,Pentan,1
i used to use swords quite a bit in early d2 but i have no idea how i managed it,Pentan,1
can't do it any more,Pentan,1
What class you running?,Arixama,1
warlock,Pentan,1
Black talon,Arixama,1
If you've got it,Arixama,1
yeah i pulled it from collections last night planning to try it out today,Pentan,1
thanks though,Pentan,1
If you were running hunter I'd suggest quickfang,Arixama,1
Cause it still is pretty good,Arixama,1
can't believe i'm taking advice on SWORDS,Pentan,1
what have i come to,Pentan,1
A loot whore,Arixama,1
@Arixama you going to be around today?,Matos,1
Possibly. What's up?,Arixama,1
just looking to do stuff on D2,Matos,1
"I'll shoot you a message when I know for sure, but it'll be after 5 that I'll be on",Arixama,1
Would anyone be interested in doing the Niobe's Torment mission tonight?,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah sure,RonInDune,1
Anyone else?,Oathbreaker,1
what is that again?,Thawxtem,1
That's the puzzle activity added in Black Armory,Oathbreaker,1
Beat 7 waves of enemies and do a puzzle to get an emblem and a ghost,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh cool, could I try?",Thawxtem,1
"Need to have a Hammerhead, Tatara Gaze, and Spiteful Fang to do it though",Oathbreaker,1
"I know to bring any BA weapons I have, but that's about it",Thawxtem,1
"Yeah, the three I listed are the ones you'd need",Oathbreaker,1
"One's the machine gun, the bow, and the last?",Thawxtem,1
The sniper,RonInDune,1
Sniper,Oathbreaker,1
"k I don't think I have the sniper hanging around, but I could forge one real quick",Thawxtem,1
"I can do sniper, I have the positions and stuff down from my last try",RonInDune,1
You can do bow or mg,RonInDune,1
I'm fine with either,Thawxtem,1
"Would be my first attempt. I can run either bow or MG, I will be swapping off of it though because screw using a bow constantly lol",Oathbreaker,1
"Oath you might like the mg most then, cause you'd need great aim",RonInDune,1
@Trissin always did mg during our attempts,RonInDune,1
Can run MG then,Oathbreaker,1
"Okay, I got to see Spider's goods for the Drifter's side of the storyline from last season for the first time today, and one of the items he sells that you're not supposed to get cost 5 override frequencies. Knowing you should only be able to hold one at a time, there is actually a way to make multiple of them at a time if your inventory is full and they are sent to the postmaster. Has anyone actually tried to buy the item from Spider this way, or would it break Destiny?",Thawxtem,1
"Wait, here's a really stupid thing, but would I have to do the quest that requires Izanagi's burden or is that something separate?",Oathbreaker,1
No way possible Thawxtem,Oathbreaker,1
What do you mean?,Thawxtem,1
People have tried but you can't actually do what you want to try if I remember correctly,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah Thawx people tried all sorts of ways, including deleting and making new characters to get more overrides to access it.",RonInDune,1
worth a shot. oh well.,Thawxtem,1
"I don't think you have to do Izanagi's, that 's part of the mysterious data pad quest",RonInDune,1
Yeah. Was wondering just because I don't really have much of a clue for that lol,Oathbreaker,1
"I got Izanagi's, was more wondering for the rest of that quest",Oathbreaker,1
"anyone know how to actually do the puzzle, or are we freehanding/googling it?",Thawxtem,1

Alright no worries,RonInDune,1
Anyone doing stuff tonight?,Matos,1
Still on,Thawxtem,1
I feel like there's not much to do actually :(( so I logged off,Trissin,1

"I mean, today would be the day.",Nahkriin,1
"What is today’s buff? Haven’t been able to check, at work",Thawxtem,1
Arc.,Matos,1
It buffs your speed and melee damage.,Nahkriin,1
so i'm now part of the build team for the remake of my all-time favorite minecraft mod,Pentan,1
"the mod was thaumcraft, but the dev discontinued it like a couple years ago. a group is remaking it and calling it Arcana and i get to be a part of it",Pentan,1
😮,Trissin,1
"that's actually pretty cool, congrats!",Trissin,1
For once I actually know what that is. Good luck with the project!,Thawxtem,1
"Thanks guys, i'm really excited to get to work on this",Pentan,1
OK but which thaumcraft we talking,Arixama,1
https://twitter.com/deej_bng/status/1156974754907033600?s=21,Arixama,1
Ooh I like the name of the new raid: ||Garden of Salvation||,Trissin,1
I'm excited for cross save and having a few more weeks to do solstice stuff,Arixama,1
@Arixama wym which thaumcraft,Pentan,1
We talking thaumcraft 3? 4?,Arixama,1
Like which iteration are you basing off of?,Arixama,1
"well 5 was the last official release, and 6 was in beta when development stopped",Pentan,1
they're basing it primarily off of 4 it seems but taking influence from all the versions,Pentan,1
"4 had the hex puzzle, right?",Arixama,1
"yup, but that's not how they're doing research",Pentan,1
@Trissin as long as it's nothing like ||Pleasure Gardens|| i'm ok,Pentan,1
it was a nightmare year 1,Pentan,1
"Man, getting 100 miniboss kills takes a while, I wish it was as a fireteam.",Nahkriin,1
I agree,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
Looks like emblems are out!!,Trissin,1
"Also yeah, 100 miniboss kills is super annoying",Trissin,1
Apparently there is a way to cheeses the miniboss kills.  If you get the cabal version of EAZ you can kill 2 out 3 bosses. Every 45 seconds an engineer will spawn. Everyone can get progress for it if they all land a shot on the engineer.,Nahkriin,1
Oh is that so,Trissin,1
But that's like 1 every 45 seconds.. I feel like it'd be faster to just run the EAZ,Trissin,1
"Maybe, I haven't tried it yet",Nahkriin,1
"Whoa, it looks like theyre making mountaintop and wendigo easier to get?!?!?",Trissin,1
and I JUST,Oathbreaker,1

"That sucks, sorry to hear that.",Nahkriin,1
"lol no need to be sorry, ill give you a heads up if I get it working again",Trissin,1
Ok,Nahkriin,1
I can run some for sure,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
If we do end up trying the cheese we probably want a third. We can just do some normal runs until then though.,Nahkriin,1
Alright. I'm just finish my current one first,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
Ok,Nahkriin,1
Just pop me an invite whenever you are ready.,Nahkriin,1
Im down to do it if you dont have 3,Baconman700,1
"Ok, we would be glad to have you.",Nahkriin,1
@Trissin I'm stuck on initializaing too!,Matos,1
guess back to the new fortnite season,Matos,1
this is actually so annoying,Trissin,1
i gave up and went to go play smash instead lol,Trissin,1
You play smash?!,Matos,1
I am probably going to get a switch and smash when I get my next paycheck.,Nahkriin,1
Yes!!,Trissin,1
I love smash,Trissin,1
And also hero came out a couple days ago,Trissin,1
"Yeah, I was playing with my brother yesterday. Hero seems pretty good.",Nahkriin,1
I know buttkikker also plays some smash.,Nahkriin,1
We should add each other on switch,Trissin,1
"Yeah, and maybe create a smash text channel on the server.",Nahkriin,1
My code is SW-3402-1268-5037,Trissin,1
Anyone else here with a switch should feel free to add me!,Trissin,1
I will definitely have to practice. I have played maybe 10 hours of smash. I will probably have to ask for your code again when I get my switch.,Nahkriin,1
Course!,Trissin,1
bro I love smash me and nakriin play all the time,max?,1
well recently we've been playing alot,max?,1
im gonna friend you so we can play sometime,max?,1
yessss 👍👍,Trissin,1
also my destiny fixed itself!,Trissin,1

How are they linking the current destiny 2 account to steam to transfer data?,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
Don't know yet,Oathbreaker,1

"Dang Ari, congrats!",RonInDune,1
don't know what that is but it looks impressive so congrats,Pentan,1
Anybody want to run last wish later tonight?,Trissin,1
Yes!!!,RonInDune,1
@Matos does,Arixama,1
"I haven't logged into destiny since before reset, so I have a lot of catching up to do",RonInDune,1
oooh yea there's a lot going on right now,Trissin,1
solstice of heroes!,Trissin,1
Yeah I'm going to go hard this weekend on finishing up atleast one set,RonInDune,1
@Arixama not a bad roll,Matos,1

holy crap,Trissin,1
rumble is interesting...,Matos,1
Im finally back and ready to grind!!!!,Buttkikker,1
Let's go!! Glad youre back,Trissin,1
It's certainly a grind,Trissin,1
i got to start a couple days ago for a few hours before leaving again to i have some progress,Buttkikker,1
but yeah its alot,Buttkikker,1
let us know if you need a hand with anything!,Trissin,1
will do!,Buttkikker,1
btw when does solstice end,Buttkikker,1
August 27 last I heard,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
ok thanks,Buttkikker,1
@Matos,Trissin,1
@Trissin What are you and Matos doing?,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
We were just doing some solstice stuff,Trissin,1
Taking a short break atm but we'll be back at it later,Trissin,1
ok,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
"I'd like to do a raid tonight, I wonder if there's enough interest in that",Trissin,1
"It's been pretty quiet lately, not a lot of people online",Trissin,1
uggg i waaana raid but solstice,Buttkikker,1
conflicted feelings,Buttkikker,1
Lool understandable,Trissin,1
"Unfortunately I don't think I'll be playing much destiny this weekend, I missed my flight and things are a bit hectic",RonInDune,1
"Good luck, and I hope you guys get enough people for the raid!",RonInDune,1
I'd be up for a raid tonight.,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
Oh no! Hope things work out smoothly @RonInDune !,Trissin,1
So do we have enough interest in a raid tonight?,Trissin,1
@Trissin you're wrong,Arixama,1
"Just got home lol, if you're wanting to do another one afterwards and have a spot open let me know!",zetaa,1
@RonInDune Are you maining Titan in Shadow keep? I heard crazy rumors.,Matos,1
*maining,Trissin,1
What time were you guys looking to raid/ do you still need more people?,Thawxtem,1
Anybody for Heroic Mengarie?,Samakain,1
"Ah, we just did some last wish yesterday night @Thawxtem",Trissin,1
"Also absolutely, would love to do heroic menagerie @Samakain",Trissin,1
Just checked this now sorry @Trissin  Let me know if you wanna throw a group together if not now then later!,Samakain,1
"Course, will do!",Trissin,1
Finally got my Switch!,Nahkriin,1
Alright!!!,Trissin,1
"I usually play through the story for the first time on my warlock, @Matos",RonInDune,1
Also guys is there anything that I can only get this week? I don't think I'll be playing much if at all,RonInDune,1
nothing specific for this week,Matos,1
just solstice and moments of triumph but those are going for some time,Matos,1
"Ah perfect, thanks",RonInDune,1
I didn't realise I was supposed to dislike Soltice until I checked the subreddit. Thankfully I have been informed that everything is in fact awful and my enjoyment is flawed. Lucky break there.,Samakain,1
"my team had 2 afk, other team had 1 afk",Matos,1
ran out of time but still won 2v3,Matos,1
Holy crap,Trissin,1
Bloody hell,RonInDune,1
yeah gambits a bit of a mess with the afks,Buttkikker,1
What's going on? Why are people idling?,RonInDune,1
Solstice requires some gambit matches completed,Trissin,1
id guess because they dont want to do gambit but need progress,Buttkikker,1
Solstic gear requires Gambit match completion,Oathbreaker,1
Performance is irrelevant,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Ahhh,RonInDune,1
Damn,RonInDune,1
really sucks,Buttkikker,1
"I mean, it's kind of annoying
But going AFK for this is just like.. why",Trissin,1
Especially in a team mode,RonInDune,1
This is like the 3rd time,RonInDune,1
I've reported more people this week then I have in the last two months.,Samakain,1
😮,Trissin,1
f,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
Holy crap the EAZ looks so cool,RonInDune,1
I hope it stays around after the event,RonInDune,1
sadly I don't think it will 😦,Trissin,1
Friendly reminder it is curse week!,Trissin,1
Make sure to get in your solo or duo shattered throne this week,Trissin,1
"Hope everyone else is having a better day than myself, because I had a dog pee on me at work 🙃",Oathbreaker,1
"@RonInDune too many functions of the EAZ are directly tied to/dependent on the SoH, such as the prizes, floating crystals that drop elemental orbs and the Taken that appear during the final boss fight.",Thawxtem,1
Oh no @Oathbreaker! Assert dominance by doing the same!,RonInDune,1
Oh yeah @Thawxtem that does make sense now that I think about it. It's a shame,RonInDune,1
"Okay, it's a Rumble match and there are literally only two of us who aren't bots. When I realize this, I stop attacking the other guy and just go for easy snipes. He apparently never got the picture and constantly went after me even though I wasn't shooting at him and was just running. He was in the lead anyway, what benefit does he have of chasing me?",Thawxtem,1
Man that's unfortunate,RonInDune,1
how many slots are left in the clan? i've got some people from my old clan that are getting back into the game and want in,Pentan,1
Plenty of space! Lol,Trissin,1
As long as they are xhill,Trissin,1
*chill,Trissin,1
Feel free to invite them,Trissin,1
"yes chill can be confirmed, thank",Pentan,1
@Trissin can i have an invite code for the discord?,Pentan,1
of course,Trissin,1
whoops,Pentan,1
"i just sent a request to join the clan i'm already in, didn't know you could do that",Pentan,1
lol what,Trissin,1
me neither,Trissin,1
"alright well i just sent him the info but he's not normally online until the afternoon so we'll see when he joins. idk what his battle.net is, it's been a while since i've played with him, but his discord is Chance",Pentan,1
"I found a map of the EAZ chests on reddit, for reference: https://imgur.com/a/0Yw9Sce",RonInDune,1
all three armor sets majestic,Matos,1
Holy cow,RonInDune,1
Nicely done,RonInDune,1
:o,Trissin,1
Congrats!!,Trissin,1
Pick up that sparrow?,Trissin,1
"Can get 3 volunteers for like an hour of your time? Prior warning, this is Crucible oriented",Oathbreaker,1
It does involve private matches so not anything involving QP or Comp,Oathbreaker,1
"I was out earlier, but do you still need people @Oathbreaker ?",Trissin,1
Not really. Wanted to test a concept for an event I'm running on Friday but I'll be gaming with a bud of mine soon. Idk if I'll have time to tonight,Oathbreaker,1
"Ah, okay",Trissin,1
Well let me know if u need a hand!,Trissin,1
"Not quite as fast as Matos, but just finished my 3 sets and got the sparrow!",Trissin,1
Damn you guys can grind!,RonInDune,1
"I started yesterday and I still haven't finished even one, I'm getting burned out lol",RonInDune,1
I'm close to my third as well,Arixama,1
"Protip to anyone who hasn't started, or is still on greens: stockpile bounties.",Arixama,1
I'm just at the end of my second and I cannot see myself doing a third.  I have died and my corpse is a EDZ patrol marker.,Samakain,1
What character you have left?,Arixama,1
@Trissin you around today for that concept testing?,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah!,Trissin,1
Okay. Car is currently in the shop and idk how long I'll be but I'll message you when I'm home. We'll need two other bodies as well,Oathbreaker,1
"Okay, np",Trissin,1
"Just let me know, I'll hop on",Trissin,1
@Trissin Available in about an hour and a bit?,Oathbreaker,1
"I should be, yeah",Trissin,1
"Not sure exactly what we're doing, but do you have enough people?",Trissin,1
"currently, no lol",Oathbreaker,1
Now that I'm thinking about it it might be okay,Oathbreaker,1
So no worries if you can't or whatever,Oathbreaker,1
"Aha no worries im still down to help out however I can, just kind of curious what we're up to",Trissin,1
I can explain it to sate your curiosity hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
"It's like a custom game, yeah?",Trissin,1
Yeah,Oathbreaker,1
Did you go with specific loadout? Or something different?,Arixama,1
Something different,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh nice the steam migration is on October 1st, and we can sign up for it from August 20th",RonInDune,1
Apparently it's so easy even a Titan can do it,RonInDune,1
@Trissin @Matos theyre reducing the miniboss amount and making the bosses count as 5,Arixama,1
yeah,Trissin,1
i saw,Trissin,1
"@Arixama Just titan, and with those changes I guess i'll give it go.",Samakain,1
oof,Matos,1
Titan is pretty easy honestly. The io patrols are probably the easiest of the three planets in my opinion,Arixama,1
"That would be true, but...then you're on Io. And Io is made of butts.",Samakain,1
Anybody want to run a raid or something?,Trissin,1
"I'm thinking crown, but whatever works",Trissin,1
Sure yeah I'm down for all,RonInDune,1
I'm getting off in 20 minutes 😦,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
aw 😦,Trissin,1
I can tomorrow night though,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
"oh okay, maybe then",Trissin,1
It seems like everyone is busy working on their solstice armor,Trissin,1
not much other activity lol,Trissin,1
we might have a group @RonInDune,Trissin,1
Oh nice i'll log in give me a sec,RonInDune,1
"so it looks like we've got 7 in total, but you are free to take my spot ron",Trissin,1
Ah no then it's fine,RonInDune,1
I have work to do lol I'd just do the raid and quit,RonInDune,1
I'll join in tomorrow!,RonInDune,1
"oh, are you sure??",Trissin,1
Yup yup it's all good,RonInDune,1
Have fun!!,RonInDune,1
okay!,Trissin,1
"thanks ron, we'll have you for our next raid",Trissin,1
"maybe tomorrow, we'll see",Trissin,1
Have fun!,TheArchSpider (D Cane),1
"@Oathbreaker the weekly comp bonus is 160 if you didn't leave any games, right?",Matos,1
Up to but not including Fabled,Oathbreaker,1
Past Fabled it drops,Oathbreaker,1
To 80 up until Mythic and like 40 up to Legend?,Oathbreaker,1
Wait,Oathbreaker,1
Bonus is 120,Oathbreaker,1
Not 160,Oathbreaker,1
"So if I'm on 1278, can I still get it purely through the bonus this season?",RonInDune,1
"If the season starts October 1st or whenever Shadowkeep actually launchers, possibly? Let me work out the math on that",Oathbreaker,1
damn i'm so close to recluse,Matos,1
i thought it was 160 which would give it to me,Matos,1
won 12 games in comp in a row but lost my last one,Matos,1
"Damn @Matos, you're really good",RonInDune,1
I played 6 games over the last couple of weeks and lost 5,RonInDune,1
Really gets me down that lol,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune If you win 2/3 of your games for the next 5 weeks you will get Fabled assuming no win streaks.,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh woah, thanks @Oathbreaker !!!",RonInDune,1
"Considering my usual records that seems completely impossible, so oh well",RonInDune,1
Anything less than a 50% W/R will not get you to Fabled,Oathbreaker,1
Makes sense,RonInDune,1
50% takes 300 something games with your Glory landing *exactly* on 2100,Oathbreaker,1
Dang this is one of the best pieces of lore in the game: ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/ghost-fragment-fallen-4#harbingers||,RonInDune,1
"I wish more of the Destiny 1 lore stuff was easily available, but I guess that's what they're doing with the Grimoires",RonInDune,1
"Also, this makes the Harbinger's Seclude in the dreaming city so much more eerie",RonInDune,1
Sparrow aquired,Arixama,1
😴😴😴😴😴,Arixama,1
Nice!! Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
finally,Matos,1
Brilliant!,RonInDune,1
Welcome to the gang,Trissin,1
😿 😢 😿,RonInDune,1
Man Unbroken players are way too good,RonInDune,1
This dude complete destroyed us,RonInDune,1
"That guy is in Primal, one of the leading PvP clans",Oathbreaker,1
Ahh no wonder,RonInDune,1
Unbrokens aren't anything great generally,Oathbreaker,1
But there are some clans who play PvP more than anything else,Oathbreaker,1
Are they a streamer clan?,RonInDune,1
"Primal, BSK, iAM, K9, T1, they're all big name clans. They have some streamers and some people who don't stream but are all about as equally crazy players",Oathbreaker,1
Is there a Destiny tournament scene? Something I can follow?,RonInDune,1
Yeah. I'm working in the morning so I'm gonna get some sleep but I'll post a shitload of links to channels to watch for sweats and tourneys,Oathbreaker,1
Oooh nice that's be very appreciated,RonInDune,1
All I know is cammycakes and drewskys,RonInDune,1
"Oh, also Encore is another clan that's well known. CammyCakes, Drewsky, Sidezz, among others are in Encore",Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, I'll get links in here tomorrow night",Oathbreaker,1
Thank you!!,RonInDune,1
"I'm trying to practice to see if I can get to Fabled, so trying out the meta builds and all that",RonInDune,1
just got my sparrow for solstice!!,Buttkikker,1
Congrats @Buttkikker !! That's quite the grind!,RonInDune,1
"Met another unbroken player,  which is better than lobbies full of bots I suppose",RonInDune,1
hey is anyone down for 2 man shattered throne and/or 200k nighfall?,Buttkikker,1
"Sure, when do you want to do it?",RonInDune,1
the sooner the better basicly,Buttkikker,1
"I don't want to do it on arc, so maybe tomorrow?",RonInDune,1
ok sure,Buttkikker,1
i should be able to do it most of the day,Buttkikker,1
also is it safe to put mods on the majestic gear or will they be deleted on shadowkeep?,Buttkikker,1
or do we even know,Buttkikker,1
I don't think we know for sure how they'll work,RonInDune,1
ok im mostly just worried about losing my armament mods but id love to optimize my set,Buttkikker,1
Dismantling gives you back all mods,RonInDune,1
Oh yeah taken armaments is super useful in throne,RonInDune,1
the main thing is im not sure if the shadowkeep majestic is its own thing or if your current set is changed,Buttkikker,1
not too big of a deal currently though,Buttkikker,1
No I think they said we'll get a new set,RonInDune,1
Oh ok then I’m definitely going to have double mods on the full set,Buttkikker,1
"Okay Ron, about to dump a whole bunch of Twitch streams",Oathbreaker,1
"http://www.twitch.tv/velm
http://www.twitch.tv/potatoe_aimer
http://www.twitch.tv/panduh
http://www.twitch.tv/lil_sonic",Oathbreaker,1
Those guys are 4 streaming a current tourney that plays on weekends,Oathbreaker,1
There are others that currently aren't streaming it but should be playing?,Oathbreaker,1
I'll list them without links,Oathbreaker,1
Tournaments for Destiny 2 Crucible or games in general?,Matos,1
Crucible,Oathbreaker,1
When I get home I'll mention more names,Oathbreaker,1
anyone for a bit of comp?,Jump,1
"Twitch Name - Clan
Wallah - BSK
Foxpax - iAM
Benny - iAM
Lambie - iAM
nferraiu - BSK",Oathbreaker,1
These guys are some of the other players who stream scrims/sweats and tourneys,Oathbreaker,1
"Cerridius also streams them occasionally but not as often, he's more of a QP monster than anything",Oathbreaker,1
Those streams would be the ones I keep an eye on for watching sweats,Oathbreaker,1
Thanks for the list oath!,RonInDune,1
Cammy casted one of the previous weekend's tourneys but I don't know if he plans on continuing,Oathbreaker,1
I saved it in a sticky for later!,RonInDune,1
"I highly recommend watching nferraiu, dude is super educational and on arguably the best team right now",Oathbreaker,1
"Masterworks done, baby! Solstice complete",Arixama,1
I am finally levelling up my other characters. Time to go baron hunting.,Nahkriin,1
@RonInDune I'm finally on sorry for the delay my internet has been out all day basically,Buttkikker,1
"It's all good, can we try tomorrow morning maybe?",RonInDune,1
I still haven't gotten the majestic set on any char yet soo,RonInDune,1
Or if anyone else is down go for it!,RonInDune,1

Dude the reveal was really cool,Jump,1
It was! The news that all legendary gear acquired after shadowkeep will be Armor 2.0 is fantastic news as well.,Samakain,1
ABOUT DAMN TIME,Chance,1
now raise the inventory and shader cap,Chance,1
it also gives nice incentive to run old content. Leviathan gear can be relevant now...same with EP gear.,thegoaliebear,1
im gunna stock pile some alkane dust and get me a good titan warlock helmet,Arixama,1

The news has freed me from the Soltice grind. Been wearing masterworked EP amor on my titan since year 1. So now I can EP in my EP while i grind for more EP.,Samakain,1
"haven't watched this yet, but it looks like it's worth linking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4d9lRPyBY8",Pentan,1
@Chance you were asking me questions that this video will answer,Pentan,1
Oh yeah i watched this earlier,Chance,1
pretty excited for armor 2.0,Chance,1
but the perk stacking might be pretty cancer in pvp,Chance,1
are they still giving bright engrams out like they used to ornah?,Jump,1
Stupid question: do u have to use the same color glow as ur subclass?,Jump,1
Or I can just buy the one I like the most and use it all the time,Jump,1
"you can apply any glow ornament to your armor, but if you match it with your subclass then the effects are stronger and more noticeable",Trissin,1
@Pentan,Trissin,1
oh so the effects look cooler when they match>,Jump,1
Just somewhat brighter,Arixama,1
"Save your materials, everything is jumping up to 750 when shadowkeep launches.",Arixama,1
Cool. Not gonna infuse anything,Oathbreaker,1
"Best part to me is they're not making Armor 1.0 obsolete, the armor will remain decent but once you can get the proper 2.0 sets you're good to go",Oathbreaker,1
One of the main things I'm concerned about is if the Iron Banner armor I've been collecting will ever be available at least as an ornament for 2.0 armor,Thawxtem,1
"Depends on if it still drops in shadowkeep. They haven't talked about whether old sets of activity armor is going to be dropping from sources at all, other than that faction and trials stuff isn't currently going to be 2.0 because there's no way to obtain them in game currently other than collections",Arixama,1
i'm pretty sure that all 1.0 armor will be available as an ornament when shadowkeep drops,Pentan,1
i'm almost certain i've heard or read that from bungo,Pentan,1
yea and make sure dismantle every eververse item since all of it can be pulled for legendary shards from your collection,Jump,1
"ok the power sources part has me confused. So there's a hard cap to 950 from regular power sources, and we have to do pinnacle activities to get higher?",RonInDune,1
That feels like D2 Y1 doesn't it?,RonInDune,1
Nope. The way you gained power from year 1 to 2 stayed the same.,Arixama,1
950 is the new max,Matos,1
960 will drop from pinnacle activities,Matos,1
as like an exra flex,Matos,1
"Year 1 you had the soft cap, then had to do weeklies and stuff to get to max.",Arixama,1
The only exception being the very end of year 1 where the only way to get to 400 was to do eow and SOS prestige,Arixama,1
"Hmm, well we'll see how that works in practice",RonInDune,1
its already been done,Matos,1
Yeah that's what I confused it with ari,RonInDune,1
the 960 stuff is just something to chase for those that want it,Matos,1
Surely the max power would be 1000?,RonInDune,1
"So soft cap is going to be 900, with the hard cap being 950. Then you'll have  the max at whatever that ends up being.",Arixama,1
What was the max power at the end of D1?,RonInDune,1
400,Arixama,1
Huh that's lower than I expected,RonInDune,1
"I mean, once they started the new system, they only had one additional dlc, and then revamped content for the last year",Arixama,1
Also this a gorgeous emblem and I want it so bad:,RonInDune,1
What was the old system? I though Power/light level was there from the start?,RonInDune,1
It was level based,Oathbreaker,1
Light would increase your level past 20,Oathbreaker,1
Cap became 34 with the best gear,Oathbreaker,1
"Once TTK started it swapped from Level 34 = Light 170, progressing up to 320, April update brought that to 335, RoI brought that up to 400",Oathbreaker,1
Interesting. Feels like Bungie was literally learning how the game should work as they went along,RonInDune,1
"Kinda. Remember, Bungie doesn't have any RPG experience prior to Destiny",Oathbreaker,1
That's true. I vaguely remember the Myth games and Oni was mostly pure action,RonInDune,1
And they've only done Halo and Destiny since,RonInDune,1
can you remove and reapply mods without any penalty? or does it cost you shit every time?,thegoaliebear,1
I think it's 500 glimmer??,Trissin,1
i think you just replace it for 500 glimmer,Teddy,1
That's what they said at least. Seems like the main cost is unlocking it,Arixama,1
"Yeah, they specified small cost:",RonInDune,1
okay that's not bad then. especially with the new cap lol.,thegoaliebear,1
anyone want to do last wish? need 3,ovenjohnson,1
I'd like to do some crown,Trissin,1
"I'd love to do any raid honestly, haven't done one in weeks",RonInDune,1
"i was also thinking about some heroic menagerie, i think some people still need to do that",Trissin,1
Yes!!!,RonInDune,1
i'm game for crown,ovenjohnson,1
crown me,Chance,1
We have 5 then?,Trissin,1
well our 3rd isn't 740 minimum,ovenjohnson,1
"I think as long as youre above 730 by the end, it's fine",Trissin,1
that's after collecting 2 pieces of powerful loot,Trissin,1
he said he's down to try,ovenjohnson,1
"If we've got 6, then I'm down",Arixama,1
he's 725 atm,ovenjohnson,1
so we'd have 5,ovenjohnson,1
he said he's down to try at least,ovenjohnson,1
He's 725 right now? that's more than high enough,Trissin,1
awesome,ovenjohnson,1
"Cool, I'm 6th then.",Arixama,1
"Great, let's start soon
How long do we need until we're ready?",Trissin,1
I'll need 30ish minutes,RonInDune,1
"chance and i are ready whenever, our other player is in a comp game of overwatch i think so it'll take a minute",ovenjohnson,1
"Okay, that's fine. 30 mins enough for you @Arixama ?",Trissin,1
@Pessaschitt,ovenjohnson,1
"Yeah, definitely",Arixama,1
I'm ready whenever,RonInDune,1
Same here,Trissin,1
same,ovenjohnson,1
where's arixama?,ovenjohnson,1
Go ahead and join on me when ready,Trissin,1
just finishing a gambit,ovenjohnson,1
Wow I’ve been so stupid,Jump,1
Hand cannon loader and small arms loader do the same thing XD,Jump,1
Wat a waste of armor pieces,Jump,1
I believe that hand cannon loader is faster because it's more specialized.,Matos,1
Based on the directors cut it seems like they are the exact same,Jump,1
So can we finish up Crown today?,RonInDune,1
oh y'all were doing crown? i missed out rip,Jump,1
"Anyone willing to try an experiment with me? For Warlock blue solstice armor, I have to kill 200 enemies with Arc super. I need 3 others to help get to phase 2 in the Reckoning, at least past the first bridge point (without me using Well). My goal is not to win Reckoning, but to blast an insane number of shadow thralls and see if it counts toward the Solstice armor.",Thawxtem,1
"Shadow thralls do count, but I finished it pretty easy in the whisper mission",RonInDune,1
Takes less time too,RonInDune,1
"Where are said shadow thrall in whisper? I cannot find them anywhere, and just keep dying",Thawxtem,1
It's in the big room where you have to take a shortcut,RonInDune,1
Just fall down it,RonInDune,1
I can log in and show you?,RonInDune,1
"You don't need to, but I still don't understand the room. It's been a while, and I'm unfamiliar with whisper again. It's near the end?",Thawxtem,1
"Yeah it's almost at the end of platforming, but before the big jump down",RonInDune,1
The big white room with all the ledges,RonInDune,1
...all the rooms are big with ledges...,Thawxtem,1
Alright I joined in,RonInDune,1
Oh oops wrong character,RonInDune,1
"Thought so. couldn't start it. Heroic, right?",Thawxtem,1
yup yup,RonInDune,1
alternatively you can do blinding well,ovenjohnson,1
@PC anyone down for some raids tonight?,RonInDune,1
I'm down for a couple raids! Won't be on for around another hour though,Peronix,1
"@Trissin was going through old D1 videos and found this LOL
https://twitter.com/lgbtholliday/status/1162922945746001920?s=19",thegoaliebear,1
Aww that's the saddest flop,RonInDune,1
it wasn't enough to just die on the totem. had to fall too lolol.,thegoaliebear,1
sadly i missed out on year 2 of d1 but i definitely recognize ~~my favorite scout~~ the objectively best scout in the series @thegoaliebear,Pentan,1
VoC was great but once I got Burning Eye that was it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Why is everyone doing EP again? Did I miss an announcement?,RonInDune,1
Armor drops for shadow keep,Arixama,1
Hmm I though they didn't drop powerful rewards,RonInDune,1
Maybe I'll start doing em too then,RonInDune,1
After shadowkeep they'll drop the 2.0 versions,Arixama,1
Ohhh right I forgot about that,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune round two of trying to get folks for raid? at least to finish crown or last wish,ovenjohnson,1
wtb fireteam to finish raid,Chance,1
5 gp,Chance,1

pretty sick,Jump,1
and they revealed details about the raid and all,Jump,1
pretty cool,Jump,1
"Yeah I've started to filter out all news now, too many spoilers",RonInDune,1
yea im def not reading too much of it,Jump,1
like they are showing vids of the first strike and story mission and im not gonna watch those,Jump,1
at that point ur just telling us whats gonna happen,Jump,1
i'm late to the solstice armor grind and it's a pain,Pentan,1
like i'm still not even done with the green. almost there tho,Pentan,1
Yeah it's a grind lol,Trissin,1
Let us know if u need any help,Trissin,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8mC5GaDoyQ  Season of the Undying Trailer. No spoilers but it looks incredibly dope.,Samakain,1
Time to bounce some juice boxes i guess.,Samakain,1
"well i just got my blue armor and i need 75 solar WEAPON guardian kills. i don't have any solar crucible weapons, so i guess it's time to start running lord of wolves",Pentan,1
"pray for my soul, for this will surely damn it",Pentan,1
Lmaoooo I promise it's not as bad as u think,Trissin,1
"Maybe do your gambit games first, I think it counts teammate kills and invaders might use solar weapons",Trissin,1
Fireteam member kills count,Arixama,1
That means invaders running fixed odds will make progress,Trissin,1
"thanks for the advice, will do",Pentan,1
sadly i **REALLY** hate gambit,Pentan,1
i forgot just how much i hated it until today,Pentan,1
but you gotta do the 10 gambits for purples,Arixama,1
"yes i'm aware, thanks ari",Pentan,1
thank you so much for reminding me that i have to play gambit,Pentan,1
i hadn't played gambit for over 3 months until i had to for the solstice gear lmao. playing it only reminded my why i hate it so much.,thegoaliebear,1
okay come on gambit isn't that bad,Trissin,1
"solo queuing with blueberries isn't great, but it's a lot of fun playing with friends in comms",Trissin,1
playing with people makes it bearable. but I'd still rather be doing anything else.,thegoaliebear,1
I'd play pvp over gambit.,thegoaliebear,1
"Hmm, not sure I'd do the same",Trissin,1
Everything's got its ups and downs,Trissin,1
"I kind of like gambit, plus I like how grinding for pinnacles changes up the meta",RonInDune,1
"Getting Hush was a nice experience, the medals part was a bit much but otherwise I loved getting good with Le Monarque",RonInDune,1
"Hush is definitely fun, yeah
I dunno about that journey though",Trissin,1
Plus if @Buttkikker or @Matos is around Gambit becomes easy mode,RonInDune,1
"It was kinda cool to switch up the loadout and use a bow, but after like 2 matches i was more like ""how much longer until I can go back to a real setup""",Trissin,1
Yeah lol,RonInDune,1
It was fun playing gambit without relying completely on Jotunn,RonInDune,1
i feel like season of drifter ruined it for me. I'm all about pve endgame so reckoning was incredibly underwhelming and having everything centered around gambit prime was like...okay.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh yeah I fully agree there, Reckoning was the worst",RonInDune,1
https://tenor.com/view/jean-ralphio-parks-and-rec-the-worst-gif-4963524,RonInDune,1
i got one full notorious set and never bothered with anything else until the Outbreak mission happened lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Atleast it seems like Bunige learned the lesson to not center an entire season around a side activity,RonInDune,1
reckoning was fun the first few times and then it just got stale. but yeah i absolutely agree limiting an entire block of content to something you do on the side was awful.,thegoaliebear,1
"it wasnt really meant to be a side activity though? it was meant to expand gambit and the lore behind it, there just wasnt a lot they could do with the way that stuff was all working together.",Arixama,1
True the lore itself was pretty cool,RonInDune,1
"The environment, as usual, was gorgeous",RonInDune,1
i think reckoning would have been an entirely different creature if we had gotten the super exotic nerfs at the start of jokers wild.,Arixama,1
yeah that's exactly the point of why it flopped so hard haha. gambit prime wasn't *supposed* to be a side thing...but the entire category of gambit *is*,thegoaliebear,1
i did enjoy the lore surrounding the season...but as far as content goes...oof.,thegoaliebear,1
"jokers wild had the revelry, right?",Arixama,1
what was that? lol tells how irrelevant that entire season was.,thegoaliebear,1
"the event, with the verdant forest.",Arixama,1
wait was that just the reskinned halloween forest?,thegoaliebear,1
"basically. different mechanics, but yeah",Arixama,1
ah i remember. the one week event that perfectly corresponded to the week my team was at the NCAA tournament lol.,thegoaliebear,1
i just...didnt give one shit about anything that happened until Outbreak arrived. they had to get people back in somehow😜😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
"i liked the invitations of the nine, it was a cool way to release the lore they wanted",Arixama,1
still haven't finished those,Trissin,1
or the allegiance quest,Trissin,1
I just read them on ishtar collective 😂,thegoaliebear,1
on any of my characters,Trissin,1
"Yeah no matter how boring an event, if they have lore hidden behind it I'll get 'em all",RonInDune,1
you're not missing anything lol @Trissin,thegoaliebear,1
oh lmao,Trissin,1
allegiance quest was decent enough.,thegoaliebear,1
There's something cool about going to some obscure location for a lore piece,RonInDune,1
"the allegiance quest was only really important to have done during season of the drifter, but im hoping that it effects future content as well",Arixama,1
Do I hear people talking smack about Gambit in here?!,Matos,1
yeah it's ass.,thegoaliebear,1
LOL,Trissin,1
😜,thegoaliebear,1
i hope we start getting some new cabal this year. im tired of red legion somehow still being around,Arixama,1
lol same.,thegoaliebear,1
"they never give up, do they?",thegoaliebear,1
Well that was fucking dumb. Just got DDOS'd at 2500 Glory lmao,Oathbreaker,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1
but of course.,thegoaliebear,1
Hope Bungie bans them,RonInDune,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Oathbreaker,1
"Basically fuck all I can do, I don't think I'll get the post game report so can't even report them lol",Oathbreaker,1
"god, stop being so good.",Arixama,1
get bad,Arixama,1
I wasn't even aimbot Oath,Oathbreaker,1
Was a rough game,Oathbreaker,1
come on they gotta guarantee their paid carries by any means necessary😜,thegoaliebear,1
Wouldn't be surprised lol,Oathbreaker,1
people who DDOS are just...sad...lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
a couple of weeks ago i was doing comp with trissin and matos and we got matched into a game with one other person,Arixama,1
and we were all trying to figure out if this dude ddosd the other team when we loaded in. but we just ended up with a free win,Arixama,1
i got ddosd several times back in the trials of the nine days. love to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
but with how much people will pay for Lunas and Not Forgotten recovs...i don't doubt lots of people do that crap. it's unfortunate but...guess realistically it's a small portion,thegoaliebear,1
Just means I'm gonna look into a VPN,Oathbreaker,1
yeah...especially with comp going 3v3 Survival. can imagine that kind of stuff will be a bit more common to experience.,thegoaliebear,1
who tryna finish up that raid we started,Chance,1
"4 stacking in crucible will always be better than 4 stacking in gambit. still not fun, just less awful. end of discussion. good night",Pentan,1
@Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
"I actually like top tree striker with the disco helmet, still pretty strong without being completely broken",RonInDune,1
The only reason that works is no one respects the shoulder charge,Oathbreaker,1
"If someone actually respects that you have it, that tree falls apart",Oathbreaker,1
That is true,RonInDune,1
I wish it had inertia override,RonInDune,1
"Bottom tree is miles better, and OEM just makes the neutral so painful to play against lol",Oathbreaker,1
really hope they just nerf OEM and striker into the ground so people actually have to be good at the game lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
OEM is fine imo if your marked don’t be dumb and peak,Teddy,1
Bottom tree striker tho,Teddy,1
That’s some dumb shit,Teddy,1
"OEM isn't as bad. Just makes it more painful to play against. Got less of an issue with it now unless I see ""Marked for Vengeance x 2"" or ""x 3""",Oathbreaker,1
"I've seen a single ""x 4"" debuff",Oathbreaker,1
I was proud of that one,Oathbreaker,1
IT IS TIME,Arixama,1
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove,Arixama,1
Well that was fairly simple,RonInDune,1
"I can continue to play till then, right",RonInDune,1
"yup,the actual transfer to steam doesnt happen til october",Arixama,1
i love how it doesn't allow me to hit I agree on the page on mobile lmaooo,thegoaliebear,1
is it a scrollable thing?,Arixama,1
It is,Teddy,1
will we be able to predownload,Jump,1
"Yeah that sucks, see if you can force desktop mode",RonInDune,1
might need to scroll all the way through,Arixama,1
i dont want to wait a day on new content day,Jump,1
yeah. so what exactly does this do just allows everything to be transferred to steam but then when cross save happens my PS4 will take over when i select as my primary account yes?,thegoaliebear,1
"Honestly it should be a 1-1 transition, we should be able to swap the game files over",Oathbreaker,1
i believe so. it's mostly important for the people who have been mainly playing on pc up to now. people on ps4 and xbox probably dont have to do it?,Arixama,1
we havent gotten anything specific about preloading @Jump,Arixama,1
well...if i don't do it then i would have to rebuy everything on steam right?,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah it transfers your licenses,Teddy,1
guess it's mainly just so the liscenses transfer?,thegoaliebear,1
its just to ensure u bought the content,Jump,1
"thats probably true. i assume since they can lock you out of using stuff based on platform currently, itll probably be similar with the old expansions if you start playing on a different system",Arixama,1
yeah it makes sense. bc i ain't buying all that again lmao. besides my ps4 will take over for cross save anyway.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh so 960 *is* the new power cap,RonInDune,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
"Yes, but you can only get there by doing prestige activities",Arixama,1
That'll be a fun grind,RonInDune,1
"Hmm this week seems pretty good for Heroic Menagerie, if people want to run it",RonInDune,1
Attrition is kind of annoying,Trissin,1
I'm always down,Trissin,1
"But we never have the interest for it, unfrotunately",Trissin,1
True true,RonInDune,1
I really want to do it but oh well,RonInDune,1
Wait I never checked but are the loadouts locked during the encounter?,RonInDune,1
"No, you can switch throughout the run",Trissin,1
flawless on this boss is fairly easy.,thegoaliebear,1
"ooh nice, what's the strat here?",RonInDune,1
Wells at each spot?,RonInDune,1
3 banner shields and 3 wells. two wells with Phoenix and one with Lunas. banner shields should run ursas. you basically just chain wells and banner shields constantly.,thegoaliebear,1
during damage on the side plates when the cyclops spawn you need one shield facing the boss and one facing middle to block that angle. take your time to take down all cyclops and as many adds as possible and use a well if you have to even if you're not capping a plate.,thegoaliebear,1
is is the ogre this week?,Trissin,1
Nah it's the Hydra,RonInDune,1
Thanks for the strat @thegoaliebear !!,RonInDune,1
Now I really want to try it once,RonInDune,1
I probably won't be playing much more till Shadowkeep so I want to finish up the small stuff,RonInDune,1

u just have to mention it in the chat,Jump,1

"also chance was telling me this but i'm gonna be very upset if i take his word for it and he's wrong, so i'm gonna ask here. i only have to get my solstice armor to purple before event ends and then i'm good, right?",Pentan,1
Yeah that's right,RonInDune,1
You can masterwork later,RonInDune,1
"aight cool, thanks",Pentan,1
"So literally all I have left for Warlock armor is 4 Gambit matches; however, Bungie thought this would be a great time to start giving be BEETs, potentially banning me from gambit until after solstice. any ideas?",Thawxtem,1

Oh well,Oathbreaker,1
do u know where to find a solid group for comp?,Jump,1
"Honestly no. I've been looking for a team lately that I gel with and the LFG Discord is such a shitshow. Solo queue comp is risky but you might run into players you do well with. I know in Nomad's server (the one I admin for and help run events on for PvP improvement) there's an LFG but there will be massive skill variation. I know people have grouped together that way, and stuck as a team but it takes time and a lot of effort",Oathbreaker,1
yea literally me,Jump,1
i remember in smite it took a while to find a solid team,Jump,1
i actually ended up picking players from plat so i could train em and make em work together,Jump,1

@Oathbreaker will u play with me XD,Jump,1
"It'll average out our Glory, and with you being lower compared to me it'll put our glory somewhere around 1900ish? Then it'll expand outwards. Not a good time to play anyways. Midday midweek is not a great time, basically only the people who play 24/7 will be on",Oathbreaker,1
oh lol i was only trolling XD,Jump,1
but yea that makes sense,Jump,1
"Besides, this season I've basically only been scrimming people and haven't really played comp too much, or even QP",Oathbreaker,1
dude i feel u,Jump,1
u need a team so u can just teamshoot,Jump,1
"Last night was my first QP game in a while and I ended up dropping a 33 defeat game with a 5.0KDA (27 kills, 4.5KD)",Oathbreaker,1
90% of the games from last night ended up with around that amount of defeats,Oathbreaker,1
yikes,Jump,1
I mean I have like a 95% win rate in Control and a 85% in Clash,Oathbreaker,1
QP is boring to me these days,Oathbreaker,1
Oh and solstice buffs remain stupid,Oathbreaker,1
i'm at around 2500 glory and i found a group on the100.io to four stack with. got Recluse done in one 2.5 hour session and went 11-0.,thegoaliebear,1
"they do have PC lfg. so i would recommend that site because you might find a group there that's available when you are. i remember when we were trying to coordinate for PS4 but we never found a time where we could just grind it out for a few hours, so that was unfortunate.",thegoaliebear,1
"Still getting BEET gambit matches. I'm playing against bots, for crying out loud, I had better not get banned before solstice ends",Thawxtem,1
the100.io is a good idea. Pretty good group sorting too,Oathbreaker,1
yeah it's a good site. always lots of stuff on there.,thegoaliebear,1
Yep. Found a lot of groups to run with through them back on Destiny 1,Oathbreaker,1
which site?,Jump,1

I’m sorry @Oathbreaker,Jump,1
Yesterday I put my sweatiest shirt on and went from 500 glory to 1950,Jump,1
Was up till 4am,Jump,1
nice!,thegoaliebear,1
"I mean, it's a good climb, I just definitely would not have recommended it because of the slide downwards",Oathbreaker,1
Yea I think looking back I should have realized it was blueberry hours earlier and stopped,Jump,1
Later at night the quality of players on both sides were good so at least lives weren’t being thrown in the toilet,Jump,1

Ooh the Mars community challenge emblem looks pretty fine,RonInDune,1
Also this is new:,RonInDune,1
Has Bungie ever done challenges like these before?,RonInDune,1
the only other one i can thing of is in last week TWAB,Teddy,1
Which is the fashion community challenge,Teddy,1
True but that one's a lot more subjective,RonInDune,1
(I'll go in as a super emo all black hunter),RonInDune,1
i don't think we've ever had one of these before. likely due to SK being delayed so they needed something for us to do haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Huh yeah that makes sense. Easy to implement tasks,RonInDune,1
Also @thegoaliebear are you still sick? Hope you get better soon!,RonInDune,1
LOL nooo I'm a senior in college😂😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
Ohhh,RonInDune,1
sorry I'm dumb,RonInDune,1
hahaha no worries but once i hit spring semester it's gonna be a legit diagnosis😂,thegoaliebear,1
Good luck! I'm sure you'll do well once you're in the thick of it,RonInDune,1
lol,Teddy,1
hoping to win back to back league championships so that will make the depression we go through kind of worth it.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm rooting for ya!,RonInDune,1
"Which sport, by the way?",RonInDune,1
Maybe they need more ghosts for the moon...?,Thawxtem,1
ice hockey as per my discord pic aha @RonInDune,thegoaliebear,1
You can do it!!,RonInDune,1
"I've never played ice hockey, but I *have* seen bits of The Mighty Ducks so I'm pretty much an expert",RonInDune,1
lolol that's all you need to know,thegoaliebear,1
GAAHHH! 1 more gambit match and I still can't get in on a game! I hate beets now.,Thawxtem,1
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do an LW sherpa run tonight? i know a guy hasn't done it yet but would like to. would be around 9:30 EST.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
"sure, why not?",Thawxtem,1
cool. so two more then.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm In,Arixama,1
awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
since i am new to the PC thing do you guys use a discord chat or just game chat.,thegoaliebear,1
We just use the discord channels here,Arixama,1
I'm down to do it,MrTster,1
If there is room,MrTster,1
okay. is it possible for someone not in this server to join the chat @Arixama,thegoaliebear,1
@MrTster yes we have one spot left.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'll do it,MrTster,1
!lfg create,Thawxtem,1
They would have to join the server in order to join the chat Goal,Oathbreaker,1
you could also just do a private call,Arixama,1
That too,Oathbreaker,1
"okay, we can do that then. do you have to be friends with each other on Discord to do it?",thegoaliebear,1
Just the host,MrTster,1
"Yeah, just the host.",Oathbreaker,1
"actually, as long as they are friends with someone, they can be invited in by said friend",Thawxtem,1
"okay, i will send him a friend request then so we can get him in.",thegoaliebear,1
wait goal are you on pc now?,Pentan,1
Crosssave baby,Arixama,1
won't be often but yes i can do up to Forsaken stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
damn aight,Pentan,1
I'm going to attempt this on kb+m but if i suck too much I'll just switch to my controller haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I think platforming might be the only thing that's super challenging,RonInDune,1
i'm gonna recommend that you don't try kbm because once i got used to it i just couldn't go back,Pentan,1
"not because i didn't want to, but because i actually lost the ability to aim with controller",Pentan,1
"i just think kb+m still feels a bit weird for me. and, i don't want to screw things up just because i'm a potato with it currently haha.",thegoaliebear,1
i'll just stick to controller for now.,thegoaliebear,1
"it's definitely an adjustment for the first little while, but a lot better once you get through that",Pentan,1
sticking with controller is probably a good call if you won't be on pc that much,Pentan,1
"If it makes you feel any better, I'll probably be slightly sucking on Saturday on ps4 @thegoaliebear",Arixama,1
haha fair.,thegoaliebear,1
so what do i do with controller just plug it in once I've booted up D2 or can i do it before that?,thegoaliebear,1
Which controller you using?,Arixama,1
ps4,thegoaliebear,1
I would assume it works like the Xbox controllers and just detects when you use it.,Arixama,1
teddy said it was just plug and play for him aha...so should just be that.,thegoaliebear,1
but just wanted to make sure.,thegoaliebear,1
I know when I turn on my controller I have to hit a button to actually get it to recognize I'm using a controller when I do,Arixama,1
okay cool👍,thegoaliebear,1
when you see your characters in 120 fps for the first time:,thegoaliebear,1
!pop,RonInDune,1
@thegoaliebear how many more do you need?,ovenjohnson,1
we have a full group.,thegoaliebear,1
ah gotcha,ovenjohnson,1
"After I finish this public event, I'll be in orbit",Thawxtem,1
im ready whenever,MrTster,1
Yup me too,RonInDune,1
"This may be a bad time to realize, but do I need to do anything for cross platform right now to get tonight to work?",Thawxtem,1
whoever has all of us added should set up the party chat here.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Thawxtem I don't think you need to do anything right now, but don't forget to get the steam migration process rolling",RonInDune,1
one sec i can't hear you guys but I think my mic is working.,thegoaliebear,1
how'd the raid go,Pentan,1
wait ya'll are probably still going,Pentan,1
at vault rn.,thegoaliebear,1
Sweet,Jump,1
I remember vault being really confusing the first time,Jump,1
it absolutely was haha. now it's my fave encounter just for the music lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Lol I’ll save that for riven,Jump,1
Too bad it only takes like a minute to beat her,Jump,1

eyy congrats!!',Jump,1
that was long but fun haha...enjoyed raiding on PC.,thegoaliebear,1
"A bit frustrating at times, but a fun time for sure",Arixama,1
it's definitely the toughest D2 raid to teach I think. just bc of its length. SoS is probs next hardest to sherpa.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm also not the *best* teacher 🤷‍♂️,Arixama,1
You're pretty good Ari!,RonInDune,1
"I'm pretty sure I used ""things"" as a descriptor multiple time in the same explanation multiple times 🤣",Arixama,1
It's a fairly versatile word,RonInDune,1

anyone interested in reckoning in a bit?,Jump,1
i have to do 4 runs for the synth upgrade,Jump,1
Maybe later in the evening for sure,RonInDune,1
sounds good,Jump,1
how many tiers does the synth have,Jump,1
"Also, Xur's selling the Arbalest if anyone didn't get it during the revelery get it now",RonInDune,1
yea he's in nessus at the barge,Jump,1
I just realized my Hunter doesn’t have access to the Whisper Thrall-way. Anyone feel like helping out with normal Whisper mission tonight?,Thawxtem,1
Consider it done,Oathbreaker,1
Sure I can join in,RonInDune,1
Gotta do it on my titan,RonInDune,1
"We can have a team of three; in the worst case, my Titan doesn’t have it either. Also, it’ll probably be about 2 1/2 hours from now at the earliest.",Thawxtem,1
Yeah that's fine wiht me,RonInDune,1
I don't think I can do that. Early start for me tomorrow :/,Oathbreaker,1
"RonInDune and I two-manned it just fine, @Oathbreaker",Thawxtem,1
Finally sat down and got sweaty again. Reached fabled! @Oathbreaker,Jump,1
It really is rough people are carrying god roll spare rations and beloved everywhere,Jump,1
Congrats man!,Oathbreaker,1
anyone down for gambit,Jump,1
i have to finish the malfeasance quest,Jump,1
im on the last step,Jump,1
mostly done just having a tough time with the kill 4 people in one invade,Jump,1
Petition to ban gambit,Pentan,1
denied what's wrong with gambit,Trissin,1
motion passed,Oathbreaker,1
No! I still need gambit for solstice!,Thawxtem,1
"Speaking of which, just got second character done. You guys think it's possible to do a third from green?",Thawxtem,1
Which set you still need?,Arixama,1
Titan,Thawxtem,1
"so mostly depends on how hard you go, but i think you can do it",Arixama,1
the titan set is probably the easiest imo,Arixama,1
Yeah Titan is for sure not very tough,RonInDune,1
"I'm 95% done with it, just need Strike void orbs, which I'll get on void day",RonInDune,1
"I'll save that for last, and do it with you if you like",Thawxtem,1
@Pentan approved.,thegoaliebear,1
👍❤️👌🤘💪🤝,Pentan,1
Lol y the hate on gambit,Jump,1
I quite enjoy it,Jump,1
It’s really fun when u roll a stack with comps,Jump,1
Comms*,Jump,1
"It's an unenjoyable mode that while works in concept falls flat in execution. Very similar to Competitive playlist for PvP.
(All my opinion)
Pros: Interesting concept, decently designed maps, interesting themes, pretty cool gear and guns.
Cons: Horribly designed heavy ammo system, almost always required to stack in order to be most effective, bugs or other issues with the mode that can be solved or may be difficult (but still possible to solve), literally just a boss rush with very basic mechanics at best. Only interaction with the other team is through invading which teammates can hog (unless you stack).

Just off the top of my head.",Oathbreaker,1
Hmm,Jump,1
I agree with heavy,Jump,1
Bugs are in everything so I won’t foul it that much and I haven’t experienced many,Jump,1
I could def see potential to making the boss fight more interesting,Jump,1
However I think ur missing the strategy involved,Jump,1
"What strategy? Get heavy, go invade. Win.",Oathbreaker,1
There’s a lot of strategy in how banking and carrying motes,Jump,1
Blocker strategy? Bah. Spam 5s or 10s at most.,Oathbreaker,1
Timing invades too,Jump,1
I wouldn’t agree,Jump,1
Minimal strategy at best.,Oathbreaker,1
Having a 15 with two 5s is more effective,Jump,1
But then again if ur invading a captain is best,Jump,1
"Most matches I play do so in the exact same method. One team gets heavy, invades, gets the lead, snowballs.",Oathbreaker,1
The 10s,Jump,1
Well that’s cuz the playlist is horribly designed,Jump,1
They shouldn’t mix comp with casual,Jump,1
"If you are required to stack in order to be most effective and to avoid blueberries who don't know what they're doing, the mode is flawed.",Oathbreaker,1
This is also true for Comp.,Oathbreaker,1
If they had a comp playlist I feel more 4 stacks would go and have a better exp,Jump,1
They can release good ad clear weapons as incentive,Jump,1
I don’t agree with that viewpoint,Jump,1
If that were the case then raids are the worst mode,Jump,1
I'm saying with playlist modes.,Oathbreaker,1
Raids are entirely different.,Oathbreaker,1
Then menagerie would be considered bad,Jump,1
I think being more effective as a stack should be true,Jump,1
More teamwork should equal better results,Jump,1
But then again I come from a moba background,Jump,1
Where teamwork is core,Jump,1
Though even halo saw that difference too,Jump,1
"It is, for a number of reasons. Takes too long to get loot, blueberries make it unbearable when they do stupid shit",Oathbreaker,1
Just my view however,Jump,1
"I'm aware teamwork should award better results. I don't disagree. But when it basically becomes the only way to deal with another team, then the mode becomes unfun.",Oathbreaker,1
"Again, this is a flaw with comp as well",Oathbreaker,1
Well I can understand that point but there’s really no way to solve that unless u remove stacking,Jump,1
Any mode that allows pairing will generally benefit from it,Jump,1
I could make that argument for strikes as well,Jump,1
Anyway point is I think gambit is fun and could def get much better,Jump,1
"Strikes are an entirely different thing altogether though? It's only PvE. In a mode where facing a stack and having no way to compete because the blueberries on your team refuse to bank and run past the bank at 15 motes unless you slay out is ridiculous. Making solos have to rely on teammates who don't know what they're doing and hope that they can somehow pull out a win doesn't make sense as a mode.

You yourself were complaining about comp recently. Similar situation.",Oathbreaker,1
Yea however I accept blueberries are bad for any competitive multiplayer mode where stacking is allowed,Jump,1
Anyway I’m trying to brainstorm ideas to make gambit better,Jump,1
And I think the first thing is a way to make boss phases better,Jump,1
"I think heavy ammo is what break gambit more than anything else. 

Having taken/fallen/hive armaments mean people have bascially inifinite heavy",RonInDune,1
So yesterday I actually got to meet the voice actor for Ghaul,Thawxtem,1
!!!!!,RonInDune,1
Woah,RonInDune,1
Congrats,RonInDune,1
Dude that’s awesome!,Jump,1
Did u tell him to I Am GHAAAAULLLLL,Jump,1
That line always gives me a chuckle,Jump,1
finally on to blue titan. 24 hours long enough?,Thawxtem,1
The 50 bounties are the biggest challenge,RonInDune,1
Had 18 saved up,Thawxtem,1
Perfect!,RonInDune,1
"Doing each world bounty gives 25-ish, so you're almost there",RonInDune,1
"Not to mention I haven't done all the planet bounties yet today, so if I do them before bed/reset, I'll have a good number available tomorrow",Thawxtem,1
...I just remembered Banshee had bounties...,Thawxtem,1
Yeah do those every day! You end up with tons of masterwork cores,RonInDune,1
Also eververse bounties don't have a limit on them so you can keep picking them up,Arixama,1
Once you complete them,Arixama,1
"figured I'd pick those up in the background and keep working on them. In the end, they may have to be the same bounties I'm forced to complete over and over due to running out.",Thawxtem,1
i want an ornament that makes the tractor cannon look like a portal gun,Pentan,1
Anyone willing to help get arc kills in the crucible?,Thawxtem,1
sorry. trying to finish up warlock. i need solar,Pentan,1
my recommendation is to do gambit first and hope that your teammates get some arc kills when the invade,Pentan,1
"definitely won't finish the whole thing, but it might help",Pentan,1
Put on an arc smg and you'll get 'em in no time,RonInDune,1
?,Thawxtem,1
riskrunner,RonInDune,1
and misfit,RonInDune,1
"Misfit is super underrated for how good it is, absolutely shreds people",RonInDune,1
who aren't expecting it,RonInDune,1
uh... i just got an invitation from the emperor?? something about a tribute hall?,Pentan,1
I think you just started the Tribute Hall quest?,RonInDune,1
get thee to nessus,RonInDune,1
probably,Pentan,1
i'm on nessus,Pentan,1
Talking to the robot?,Arixama,1
i think i got it when i opened one of the the chests,Pentan,1
By the robot?,Arixama,1
no the ones in the d1 tower,Pentan,1
yes by the robot,Pentan,1
Well for tribute hall there's one right by the robot. Not with the rest of them,Arixama,1
yeah that's what i opened,Pentan,1
"I think there should be a new destination for you now, in the nessus page, right by the Leviathan raids",RonInDune,1
sure is,Pentan,1
"First, visit Werner in the nessus barge, that should properly start the quest",RonInDune,1
http://orcz.com/Destiny_2:_Visit_Werner_99-40_-_Invitation_of_the_Emperor,RonInDune,1
i already started it though,Pentan,1
"Ah I forgot what the exact steps are, just talk to the Calus statue in the Tribute hall next maybe",RonInDune,1
@Pentan do you still need the strike part of the armor?,Thawxtem,1
"nope, i'm done with strikes",Pentan,1
"i need gambit matches, titan scout missions, and one more run on eaz",Pentan,1
everything else should just come naturally,Pentan,1
Let me know when you're up for gambit (hopefully prime) and I'll join you if you like,Thawxtem,1
alright,Pentan,1
"@Thawxtem @Chance let's go, gambit matches rn",Pentan,1
"fighting boss in strike, 1 sed",Thawxtem,1
"@Thawxtem @Chance about to get back on, what did I miss",Pentan,1
almost done with out titan shit,Chance,1
"hey guys, i'm gonna make a poll",Pentan,1
"Is it cannibalism if you eat your own arm? ✅ for yes, ❌ for no",Pentan,1
"You wanna get technical with it, it's auto-cannibalism",Arixama,1
"I just opened like 90 solstice packages and got like, maybe 8 or 9 pieces of solstice armor",Trissin,1
F,Oathbreaker,1
won't matter when 2.0 comes out,Pentan,1
True,Trissin,1
But how many enhancement cores did you get?,Arixama,1
"alright, i finished my solstice grind",Pentan,1
time to not touch this game again until shadowkeep,Pentan,1
tractor cannon + retold tale is my new favorite build,Pentan,1
"oh wait, i have 40 packages to open",Pentan,1
I did...all 3 of my characters,Chance,1
im okay,Chance,1
im fine,Chance,1
my soul has not been completely ripped from my body,Chance,1
lol i literally only did warlock,Pentan,1
haven't played anything but warlock since forsaken. even then i barely touched hunter,Pentan,1
"Trissin and Ari, the absolute madmen, did all 3 the first week",RonInDune,1
i believe it,Pentan,1
"they're nuts, of course, but i believe it",Pentan,1
"I did Warlock and Titan, just trying to get hunter to blue",RonInDune,1
why even go for blue if you know you won't get purple,Pentan,1
literally no point,Pentan,1
not sure lol,RonInDune,1
minor sense of accomplishment?,Thawxtem,1
go to sleep my guy 😂,Pentan,1
Eh I won't be playing much destiny any time soon,RonInDune,1
Control releases tomorrow!,RonInDune,1
by tomorrow I mean today,RonInDune,1
of course,Pentan,1
"i'll tell you one thing. i thought my will to play this game would be completely drained after that grind, and i'm sure it would be  if i did all 3 characters, but now that i have something to show off and since i haven't been completely worn out on it, i find myself wanting to play it",Pentan,1
yeah that's very true,RonInDune,1
i was talking with chance earlier and i wonder how many players will have solstice armor when shadowkeep drops,Pentan,1
how special will we be,Pentan,1
"will my light up sketchers stand out, or will half the playerbase be walking around glowing like it's laser tag",Pentan,1
i really can't wait for armor 2.0,Pentan,1
once i get my 2.0 solstice stuff i'm just never gonna wear any other armor,Pentan,1
alright. gn lads. get some sleep @RonInDune,Pentan,1
Finally finished all Solstice gear & got sparrow. too tired to try it out.,Thawxtem,1
first 3 weeks thats nothing,Chance,1
i did my warlock AND titan IN 4 FUCKING DAYS,Chance,1
Solstice looks pretty ugly imo I’m just gonna slap the eververse ornaments over it,Teddy,1
u say that now but when that sweet new armor from shadowkeep comes out u'll forget about solstice gear real quick,Jump,1
plus the fact that escalation protocol gear is also gonna be 2.0,Jump,1
make sure to get the glows u want i think today is last day,Jump,1
Congrats @Thawxtem and @Chance! That was quite the grind!,RonInDune,1
@Jump,Pentan,1
Gonna be wearing this set forever,Pentan,1
"@RonInDune if you havent started playing control yet, id definitely suggest headphones if you can",Arixama,1
yeah I just started! Headphones are perfect,RonInDune,1
Holy crap the game is soo good,RonInDune,1
It really is,Arixama,1
is it weird that after all that soul rending grind that i want to play the ACTUAL game now,Chance,1
and this week is iron banner....,Chance,1
could go after that swarm of the raven,Chance,1
^^,Trissin,1
Swarm with spikes,Trissin,1
U need it,Trissin,1
"Playing crucible on Titan is one of the last (and worst, for me) things I had to do for solstice. Now it’s IB, and I’m only missing Titan armor. Why do Shaxx and Saladin hate me so much?",Thawxtem,1
Obviously cause you don't like titans 🤷‍♂️,Arixama,1
Easy solution: ||just don’t play titan||,Pentan,1
@Chance I had the same feeling,Pentan,1
Also what’s this control thing everyone is going on about? You mean like the crucible game mode?,Pentan,1
fuck titan,Chance,1
hunter or warlock,Chance,1
just in case any of you haven't done this yet,Pentan,1
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/PCMove,Pentan,1
i'd hate to see anyone forget,Pentan,1
"Control is a game made by Remedy, who I'm pretty sure made Quantum Break, Alan Wake, and the first two Max Payne games. Just got released recently.",Oathbreaker,1
Wait they're fixing both the Wendigo and the Mountaintop questlines?,RonInDune,1
The Wendigo wasn't that bad of a grind was it? I remember finishing it without too much difficulty,RonInDune,1
Hush was way worse,RonInDune,1
It's more of a tedious grind reliant on a pretty tedious activity. They could easily fix wendigo grind by making available in any strikes,Arixama,1
"I almost forgot, Widow's Court is coming back!!!",Trissin,1
That makes me happy,Trissin,1
Thoughts @Oathbreaker ?,Trissin,1
Widows court is?,Arixama,1
I GET TO FUCKING SNIPE AGAIN YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS,Oathbreaker,1
:D,Trissin,1
A map?,Arixama,1
A FUCKING GOOD MAP,Oathbreaker,1
Oh no,RonInDune,1
Love that map,Trissin,1
Are there any others they're bringing back?,Trissin,1
It’s the one with the church in the middle right?,Teddy,1
Yeah,Trissin,1
That map is dope,Teddy,1
One of the better d1 maps imo,Teddy,1
^^,Trissin,1
Oh I remember the clip from the ViDoc,RonInDune,1
i never played D1 but if you say its a sniping map then you have me interested,Chance,1
it's good for sniping and also some nice close range engagements if you're in the church area. but you can basically spawn snipe lol,thegoaliebear,1
"Earlier it seems my message was misread; I don’t hate Titans, it’s just that killing guardians with arc weapons as a Titan that (to me) focuses more on melee attacks and such was the most painful task of all guardians for me, since I was doing it alone when I couldn’t get help (and I’m bad at PvP)",Thawxtem,1
Nah I was making a  joke 🤣,Arixama,1
I was so excited that I finally finished my last guardian legendary solstice set...,Thawxtem,1
I was tired at 3 in the morning...,Thawxtem,1

Not Forgotten. That's it.,Oathbreaker,1
"MIDA Catalyst does come from legend, yes.",Oathbreaker,1
Is the MIDA really that good? I like it but still,RonInDune,1
No lol,Oathbreaker,1
Not even with catalyst,Oathbreaker,1
"fyi guys if you want silver before shadowkeep, you only have until the 3rd to buy it",Arixama,1
"so the one triumph is collecting weapons by reaching fabled in multiple seasons, but does that track the weapons collected, or is it actually gatekept by seasons?",Arixama,1
I think it's just collected,Trissin,1
"so you could get the triumph by getting nf, mountaintop and recluse in a single season?",Arixama,1
Yes,Trissin,1
"You mean Luna's, right?",Oathbreaker,1
yes,Arixama,1
NF is Legend rank and requires Luna's,Oathbreaker,1
Okay good,Oathbreaker,1
Just wanted to double check,Oathbreaker,1
"i mean, if you got nf  you got a weapon by getting to fabled :BAha:",Arixama,1
New raid loot is reskinned eververse armor. Yikers.,Matos,1
we have it in #destiny-spoilers too. hoping it's just a placeholder.,thegoaliebear,1
and it looks like the exotic trace rifle from the raid is part of the collections badge so...lets just hope that's a quest based item and we don't have another 1KV situation💀,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah it fucking sucksss,Teddy,1
and here we were thinking they learned how to structure a good title chase with Shadow lmaooo.,thegoaliebear,1
guess they realized the fact that people still don't have 1KV after 100+ chests was the artificial difficulty we really need.,thegoaliebear,1
They gotta keep you playing the game so they can sell you some eververse stuff lol,Teddy,1
LOL yeah tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"That settles it, I’m starting the unbroken grind. You with me @Oathbreaker?",Pentan,1
Hmm the mountaintop quest changes are very nice,RonInDune,1
that wasn't the raid gear,Jump,1
it was the gear from the new ativity,Jump,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/cxrz0v/i_dont_think_we_should_accept_reskins_as_raid_loot/eyok386?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x,Teddy,1
nope,Teddy,1
wow rip,thegoaliebear,1
The raid weapons look cool.,Matos,1
"Haven't been keeping up, where are you guys finding all of this? Reddit?",Trissin,1
yes dmg confirmed the reskinned eververse set is the new raid armor lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
maybe there will be ornaments or something for it? idk i'm just wishful thinking rn because that's really disappointing lol.,thegoaliebear,1
@Trissin people are putting screenshots from PAX up on the subreddit.,Matos,1
"Ah, makes sense.",Trissin,1
new warlock exotic,Teddy,1
oh my that's crazy,Pentan,1

!lfg create,camembertbear,1
@here,Arixama,1
:o,Trissin,1
I would join but I'm out right now!,Trissin,1
Did you move to PC @camembertbear ??,Trissin,1
@Trissin it's a special case- just to sherpa this 9YO  buddy. but cross save makes it easy. still using a ps4 controller since idkwtf is going on with keyboard and mouse,camembertbear,1
it's quite comical,camembertbear,1
Ouuuu I see,Trissin,1
Sorry I can't help but good luck!!,Trissin,1
thanks!,camembertbear,1
How do I tell if I correctly enabled cross-save?,Thawxtem,1
"If you go in game it should have a ""crosssave enabled"" tag",Arixama,1
Where do I find this tag?,Thawxtem,1
When you mouse over your emblem in the roster,Arixama,1
"Sorry, thought I said that 😂",Arixama,1
"Now I'm worried that I linked it to a non-existent account, because I can't find the tag",Thawxtem,1
"When you log in, on the character select screen there should also be the icon",Arixama,1
Like so,Arixama,1
How long did you wait?,Thawxtem,1
It was pretty much instant. Did you make sure that you authenticated all of the accounts linked to your bungie account?,Arixama,1
"I missed out when they were removed on D2, but could someone explain the benefits/exclusives of the 3 Factions in D1?",Thawxtem,1
faction gear and weapons and an exotic class items quest. and they were accessible constantly there were no faction rallies in D1.,thegoaliebear,1
"Details for the update are out, it might be time to grind some reckoning",Trissin,1
oh whats new?,CrizMobius,1
nice,CrizMobius,1
I'll grid the the gambit armours for sure,CrizMobius,1
"Cool, are you on PC criz?",Trissin,1
Yes just moved,CrizMobius,1
"Nice, welcome!",Trissin,1
thx ^^,CrizMobius,1
"Lately our group has been a lot less active since destiny is kind of on a down right now, since solstice just finished and the season is nearly over",Trissin,1
But I might be on a bit more this week for reckoning weapons and the mars challenge,Trissin,1
That's awesome to hear :).,CrizMobius,1
@Trissin Btw with crossplay being active are you thinking of merging the clan on each platform?,CrizMobius,1
The biggest problem is the size that clans are allowed. 100 members isn't nearly enough for people across all 3 platforms,Arixama,1
ah well thats a bummer,CrizMobius,1
"^^
This is also why we had 2 separate clans for Xbox and PS4 for D1",Trissin,1
You should be able to upgrade your clan to have more members imo,CrizMobius,1
Does Warframe have a limit on their clans?,CrizMobius,1
"No, but requirements for research increase the more members you have",Oathbreaker,1
At this point there's really no reason to have a limit on clan members for Destiny since they already have in game limits on leveling up and stuff.,Arixama,1
"Clans that have 10 members require less resources and such for blueprints, whereas clans with 1000 members or more have massively increased requirements in comparison",Oathbreaker,1
yeah seems like a better system,CrizMobius,1
"I think the only issues with destiny's current system is that it's not super beneficial to be in a small personal clan, and the clan member limit doesn't make sense with their current clan xp system",Arixama,1
"Lunafaction Boots and Rally Barricades look like they're getting tuned: ||they no longer auto-reload, instead increase reload speed||",Trissin,1
Excited for that honestly,Arixama,1
It'll be an interesting change,Trissin,1
"||Loaded Question|| and ||breech-loaded GLs|| are gonna be weaker, but meanwhile this is actually quite a buff for ||Izanagi's||",Trissin,1
can't wait to still never play reckoning lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
@CrizMobius will you be solely on PC now?,thegoaliebear,1
bc your clan is tied to whichever account you set as your primary for your cross save characters. so you can leave the PS4 clan if you will be primarily on PC.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'll probably go 100% PC,CrizMobius,1
I'm addicted to frames,CrizMobius,1
okay cool. so yeah then leave PS4 clan and join PC clan so that way you can get the clan rewards and whatnot.,thegoaliebear,1
"ok so I've been out of Destiny for a week, did they say anything about the Mars resonant stem nodes? Better chance of getting a new one maybe?",RonInDune,1
not really there's a just a community Mars event this week.,thegoaliebear,1
So anyone feel like doing a heroic menagerie one of these days? Apparently the Izanagi Catalyst is going to be super important,RonInDune,1
i still haven't bothered to get that gun lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
It’s really good imo,Teddy,1
It's bit of a grindy quest,RonInDune,1
But the gun feels and works super well,RonInDune,1
i've been just fine without it lol. don't really wanna waste my time.,thegoaliebear,1
doing old content that i didn't find fun.,thegoaliebear,1
Nooo izanagi is so cool,Trissin,1
I like it a lot,Trissin,1
"Not really grindy, just rng based",Arixama,1
yeah that's gonna be a hard no from me.,thegoaliebear,1
after 1KV i will never get hung up on something that requires RNG again.,thegoaliebear,1
Cause you've gotta get one of the rare black armory bounties for it,Arixama,1
"Honestly all of the Black Armory weapons have been excellent, better than aything from the other seasons",RonInDune,1
i legitimately have never had a rare BA bounty drop.,thegoaliebear,1
"so, hard pass.",thegoaliebear,1
the best Original weapons for sure,Jump,1
anyone down for a raid later tonight?,Jump,1
the only BA weapons i consistently use are Jotunn and hammerhead lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Blast Furnace/jotunn was my PvP combo for so long,RonInDune,1
I used Le Monarque for Gambit bow farm for a while,Thawxtem,1
The dad loadout tho,Teddy,1
Exactly lol,RonInDune,1
i never bothered with grinding for a good BF. outlaw/rampage chattering bone is my go-to if I'm not using outbreak.,thegoaliebear,1
top tree titan with hallowfire heart and blast furnace/jotunn/outrageous fortune,RonInDune,1
Yeah chattering bone serves basically the same purpose,RonInDune,1
Though even my best best chattering bone has around half the range of my blast furnace,RonInDune,1
Thing's a laser,RonInDune,1
"I think they only drop from regular ba bounties so if you don't do those, there's no chance for them to drop. The only reason I would do ba bounties now are just for easier bounties to complete",Arixama,1
my loadout for everything has just been outbreak/recluse/outrageous fortune basically lol. sometimes i'll use loaded question or jotunn.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah i haven't done something BA related aside from forging 10 weapon frames for moments of triumph lol.,thegoaliebear,1
@Oathbreaker whats the best masterwork for hammerhead?,Jump,1
and is quickdraw rampage a good roll?,Jump,1
Yes,Oathbreaker,1
Range is likely one of the better rolls,Oathbreaker,1
*Maaaaybe* stability,Oathbreaker,1
i mean i can choose whichever i want,Jump,1
But reload is useless for PvP so,Oathbreaker,1
and which roll is the god roll?,Jump,1
"For Hammerhead? No, RNG on MW",Oathbreaker,1
?,Jump,1
sorry i didnt quite understand,Jump,1
"^
You can't choose whichever MW you want, it's determined by RNG",Trissin,1
Thank you Trissin,Oathbreaker,1
I'm tired lol,Oathbreaker,1
oh yea i see that,Jump,1
i got reload speed rip,Jump,1
well regardless whats the best perk roll for hammerhead,Jump,1
"Anyways. In theory, this is best perks for each slot. Personal pick in italics.

Barrel: *Arrowhead Brake*, Fluted Barrel, Hammer Forged Rifling, Polygonal Rifling
Magazine: High Caliber Rounds or Appended Magazine (no personal favorite)
Perk 1: Dynamic Sway Reduction, *Quickdraw*, Tap The Trigger (DSR and TTT are great options too IMO)
Perk 2: Rampage or *Mulligan*
Preferred MW would be Range personally, though arguments could be made for Stability or Handling",Oathbreaker,1
~~Perk 1~~ Magazine: not _ricochet_?,Trissin,1
You mean for Mag?,Oathbreaker,1
"No, fucks with the FOV",Oathbreaker,1
Wait,Oathbreaker,1
No that's just Rangefinder I think?,Oathbreaker,1
Let me test in a minute,Oathbreaker,1
i rolled full bore/ richochet/ quickdraw/ rampage,Jump,1
"Anyways, personally, Ricochet is *okay* but increased flinch for tilting opponents harder, or having a larger magazine for more rounds of pure tilt is better IMO",Oathbreaker,1
please mark as spoiler!,Trissin,1
@Teddy,Trissin,1
my bad,Teddy,1
all good all good,Trissin,1
new armour set for shadowkeep,Teddy,1
I really like the Titan set but not the helmet,Trissin,1
lol thats what i said to the ps4 guys,Teddy,1
that hunter helmet looks awful too,Teddy,1
And the ||Warlock helm|| really looks like the one from ||last wish||,Trissin,1
No decrease in FOV from RR,Oathbreaker,1
Must be thinking Rangefinder,Oathbreaker,1
"No I think you were right, RR slightly increases zoom @Oathbreaker",Trissin,1
i really like that warlock helmet,Teddy,1
Just not by a lot,Trissin,1
Just compared two screenshots with and without on a JQK3,Oathbreaker,1
"If it does, you're looking at like maybe 5% zoom increase at MOST",Oathbreaker,1
Something that's real hard to see,Oathbreaker,1
Ah,Trissin,1
Other than the ||spooky Astronaut armour|| none of the other sets released so far have looked particularly exciting to me honestly,RonInDune,1
The first one in this collection looks pretty cool : ||https://twitter.com/eclittlejohn/status/1168957647283994625||,RonInDune,1
god that warlock set in the first pic looks like ass,Teddy,1
hahaha deadass.,thegoaliebear,1
Alright there are way too many Destiny trailers.,RonInDune,1
Can anyone help me find the ones where it shows Zavala and co. helping build the Wall and a child Amanda Holliday looking at a ship flying away?,RonInDune,1
https://youtu.be/xI5poBxV_-A,Teddy,1
Ohh thanks,RonInDune,1
Best destiny trailer by far,Teddy,1
It is *so good*!,RonInDune,1
"I didn't realize it was a D2 trailer, do we have origin stories for Ikora/Cayde?",RonInDune,1
Unfortunately no,Teddy,1
"I like the ""what is destiny 2"" trailer",Trissin,1
"Ooo i hadn't seen that one before, yeah it's a nice one",RonInDune,1
Also found a semi-live-action trailer from D1 The Taken King,RonInDune,1
That had pretty good comedic timing,RonInDune,1
"As I said, so many trailers",RonInDune,1
There is a live action one for D1 launch too,Teddy,1
"I know the D2 launch live action one, hmm lemme see if I can find the D1",RonInDune,1
https://youtu.be/ZSWN-VP0lD8,Teddy,1
Ok that's the best one yet,RonInDune,1
They should Duncan Jones to make some Destiny Live action shorts,RonInDune,1
Here the reveal trailer https://youtu.be/gIp7vZuYzoA,Teddy,1
The warlock throws a solar nade and then uses a nova bomb lol,Teddy,1
"Oh man old russia looks so good, loved going there in the Thunderlord mission",RonInDune,1
The patrol zones in D1 are better than D2 imo,Teddy,1
Apart from the Dreaming City,Teddy,1
Yeah Dreaming City and Titan are my fave zones in D2,RonInDune,1
"Wish they did more in Titan though, it's a bit under utilized",RonInDune,1
Especially the arcology,RonInDune,1
Agreed I wish we had a raid or a dungeon on Titan,Teddy,1
I just have bad memories of Titan after this last SoH,Thawxtem,1
The never ending patrols were rough,RonInDune,1
Lol,Teddy,1
That was definitely the worst one out of the three,Teddy,1
I just fell back into the old faction rally route,Arixama,1
Literally did 4 reckoning runs with 4 different sets of fireteams,Jump,1
the level of incompetency is unbelievable,Jump,1
"is exo stranger ever coming back, or are we just pretending that she was ~~nord~~ nonsense and never to be heard from again",Pentan,1
Do you mean the Exo stranger?,Teddy,1
yes exo stranger my bad,Pentan,1
i'm tired alright,Pentan,1
Lol no worries,Teddy,1
We got some stuff in warmind,Teddy,1
yeah i missed warmind. i played seasons 1 and 2 and then came back for forsaken,Pentan,1
and then i was gone again until opulence,Pentan,1
i'll look into it later,Pentan,1
i should go to bed. it's nearly 5am,Pentan,1
"i've never played wow in my life except for the last week, and then my friends gave me a key for a free month of classic. now i don't sleep, and i blame them.",Pentan,1
Riven Cheese might get a wee bit harder now,RonInDune,1
Also the super reduction feels harsh imo,RonInDune,1
Good,Oathbreaker,1
Sick and tired of PvP being super chaining,Oathbreaker,1
I agree,RonInDune,1
lol i bet 60% of players haven't done riven legit,Teddy,1
or know how,Teddy,1
Count me among those who never successfully finished legit Riven lol,RonInDune,1
"my attempts were an absolute nightmare, kept hitting the wrong eye during the final damage phase",RonInDune,1
Been a long time since I have but I could do it.,Oathbreaker,1
Also some of the new armor sets are really good imo,RonInDune,1
Especially like the ||Phenotype Plasticity|| set,RonInDune,1
i love the titan,Teddy,1
the shoulder guards are actual weapons now lol,RonInDune,1
Anyone feel like doing a raid or a nightfall or something tonight? I just finished Control and ready to get back to Destiny...,RonInDune,1
yea i need  to do a mars nightfall still,Jump,1
Does Opening shot on a sniper matter? I'm thinking since you one shot headshot anyway it might be a bit overkill,RonInDune,1
Yes,Oathbreaker,1
Stickier first shot,Oathbreaker,1
More forgiving headshots with Opening Shot,Oathbreaker,1
Thanks oath!,RonInDune,1
I have a nice Sole Survivor with Opening shot and I'm gonna try it out,RonInDune,1
"if you ever get a sniper with opening shot and firmly planted, slap a targetting adjusting on that shit along with some enhanced sniper rifle targetting if you're lucky enough to have that (i do)",Chance,1
you're going to be shooting kitchen appliance sized hitboxes,Chance,1
its dumb,Chance,1

I can raid,CrizMobius,1
im down rn or this weekend,Chance,1
Anyone for a quick 100K nightfall?,RonInDune,1
"Not sure if everyone is aware of this (posted in general chat), but there are now Title roles in our discord! You can head over to the #role-assign channel to pick up your badges and flaunt them in the server. :Cursebreaker:",Trissin,1
"I also want to take a second to apologize for being inactive lately, with solstice being over, Destiny being at a content low, and getting back to school, work, etc.",Trissin,1
"However, with Shadowkeep dropping soon (less than a month!), I will likely getting back into the game, both for prep and also to do current content before it becomes deserted. I'll be around for nightfalls and raids this weekend, so if anyone needs a hand with anything let me know!",Trissin,1
I would like to request one one thousand voices and one anarchy please,RonInDune,1
i could probs do a 3x riven and one queenswalk tomorrow evening. if you want max chances at 1KV.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'm super down for that,RonInDune,1
^ill help out with that too,Trissin,1
"@Trissin not need to apologize, games in a bit of a lull now",Matos,1
what time would you guys be available for LW tomorrow @Trissin @RonInDune . i'm usually able to get on around 9.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah 9 is fine with me, I'll be available most of the day",RonInDune,1
cool.,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do 3x Riven and Queenswalk tomorrow evening for Ron's support network to get 1KV.,thegoaliebear,1
"Goal, your est, yeah?",Arixama,1
i'm down,Matos,1
@Matos do you have 1KV yet?,RonInDune,1
I should be able to be available,Arixama,1
"I don’t have it either. I’ll be available, but I’m only good for one run",Pentan,1
yes i'm' EST.,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune I don't have any raid exotics,Matos,1
"So I was watching some D1 nightfalls, and dragonfly feels like it worked slightly differently there?",RonInDune,1
Firefly was the perk,Oathbreaker,1
Had a bigger radius,Oathbreaker,1
"Interesting, wonder why they changed it then",RonInDune,1
Good question,Oathbreaker,1
so how many do we have for 3x Riven tonight?,thegoaliebear,1
1,RonInDune,1
😦,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear, @RonInDune, @Matos, @Trissin, and me is 5? i dont think we had a sixth",Arixama,1
anyone else then? @Destiny [PC] ^,thegoaliebear,1
"sure, why not?",Thawxtem,1
"Also, is anyone available to do 6 forge runs back-to-back with me? I finally got a rare bounty from Black Armory and can move on with Izanagi's Burden quest if I can finish it",Thawxtem,1
wish i could haha.,thegoaliebear,1
@Thawxtem yeah I'm down later,RonInDune,1
Need to do a bunch for the ship anyway,RonInDune,1
"These are just dry runs of the forge. For the ship, you actually have to forge a frame.",Thawxtem,1
When?,Trissin,1
Whenever,Thawxtem,1
"Oh also for the Mars community challenge emblem, do we need a 100K run or will any run count?",RonInDune,1
any mars nf run i believe.,thegoaliebear,1
nice then I'll do the overpowered arc singe wardcliffe run,RonInDune,1
"via TWAB from Sept. 5 just to be 100% sure aha:

Remember, to qualify for the exclusive Community Event emblem, you'll need to complete one Nightfall before next Tuesday at 10:00 AM Pacific```",thegoaliebear,1
"Perfect, thanks!",RonInDune,1
@RonInDune care to do a nightfall now before raids?,Thawxtem,1
Ah give me 30 mins,RonInDune,1
When are we doing riven?,Trissin,1
I'll be on around 8:45. so i can go whenever everyone is good.,thegoaliebear,1
About an hour or so from now?,RonInDune,1
works for me if others are good too.,thegoaliebear,1

So today is Destiny's 5 birthday!,RonInDune,1
How many of y'all were there since the beginning?,RonInDune,1
✋,Teddy,1
Been around since the days of beta. First day it was active on Xbox 360 I had it downloaded and was playing.,Oathbreaker,1
Picked it up Day 1 and have played it for an ungodly amount of time since,Oathbreaker,1
I've only been around since year 2,Arixama,1
Just a heads up that today is the last day to complete a nightfall for the Mars community challenge emblem,Trissin,1
"I have a couple of Emblem of Synth codes remaining, does anyone want one?",RonInDune,1
How do you have so many emblem codes Ron??,Trissin,1
Lol I ordered the seal pins separately so I got a code for each,RonInDune,1
Plus I caved in and got the lanyard,RonInDune,1
"Oh, I see lol",Trissin,1
"I don't have the emblem of synth, but I think even if I did I probably wouldn't have it on very much. So I'll leave the offer to others, ty for your generosity ron!",Trissin,1
cheers!,RonInDune,1
"@RonInDune since there doesn't seem to be a lot of interest here, you could try the general chat?",Arixama,1
"I might do that, hope I'm not breaking any rules",RonInDune,1
"Lol you're not breaking any rules, don't worry",Trissin,1
But I mean if nobody wants the emblems I wouldn't mind having it at all lol ;),Trissin,1
"yay, here you go",RonInDune,1
Lool thanks Ron!,Trissin,1
Finally got Khepri's sting!,RonInDune,1
All armour and collectible exotics acquired,RonInDune,1
Now just waiting for @Thawxtem to get Anarchy,RonInDune,1
haha nice.,thegoaliebear,1
"so depending how things look come holiday time, I might get SK digital deluxe on PC around that time and go pc as my main platform.",thegoaliebear,1
One of us. One of us.,Arixama,1
"haha i thought it would be better to wait, but having my pc at college this year has been real easy given how much i already use it to do work.",thegoaliebear,1
I'm also getting sick of having to pay an extra $60 a year for online lol. i could use that to just get SK on pc 😩,thegoaliebear,1
BuT yOu GeT fReE* gAmEs,Arixama,1
😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
none of which I've ever downloaded hahaha,thegoaliebear,1
There like a couple every so often that are worth getting 😂,Arixama,1
the last one i downloaded was when BO3 was free as a promo for BO4,thegoaliebear,1
sometimes I'll download one just to have it in my library if i ever wanna check it out at some point tho.,thegoaliebear,1
Id pc more if I didn’t sit at a desk all day at work,Teddy,1
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't season license supposed to transfer if you purchase them on your primary account? Or is that just undying?",Arixama,1
Correct,Teddy,1
Shadowkeep doesn’t but seasons do,Teddy,1
so i don't have to buy the digital deluxe on PC? i can just get the base?,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah,Teddy,1
oh. well...✌,thegoaliebear,1
😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
The only reason would be if you super care about the deluxe edition items,Arixama,1
I'd assume those licenses would be tied to the platform.,Arixama,1
but with cross save I'd have them anyway from my ps4 account right lol,thegoaliebear,1
not that i care too much about them tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"so if I'm interpreting this correct, even if i only get the base SK on pc, I'll still be able to play the seasons included in the annual pass on pc since I've purchased in on ps4?",thegoaliebear,1
That's what we know based on what bungie has said. By holiday time we'll know for sure though,Arixama,1
"I know I have the limited edition stuff from vanilla unlocked, but I can't use it on pc",Arixama,1
that would be awesome if that turns out to be the case. I'll likely be switching then anyway but would be nice to only have to spend the extra $35 instead of another $60 lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh for sure, I'm probably going to pick up the standard edition of shadowkeep on Ps4 unless there's some insane perks on that ghost shell",Arixama,1
I'm really tempted to just get the base sk on pc now tbh. that way i can download it all once it launches.,thegoaliebear,1
"i saw a post on reddit about like, what the preload process for pc would be and people who are switching the game to their HDD because it's so big haha.",thegoaliebear,1
"Youll be able to download it all when it launches anyway. I'd honestly wait, cause I don't think there's a way to upgrade to digital deluxe?",Arixama,1
I expect there will be some amount of time that bungie will allow people to preload new light before shadowkeep drops,Arixama,1
yeah i want to see exactly how it works before i commit. i don't wanna get it now only to find out I'll actually have to pay again for the season pass later on.,thegoaliebear,1
Wait you have to pay 60$ to go online in consoles? Or is it a Destiny thing?,RonInDune,1
it's a console thing hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
Playstation plus and Xbox gold are 10 bucks a month or 60 for a year,Arixama,1
$60 for Playstation Plus. you get online access in  multiplayer games and access to extra deals and stuff on the PS Store.,thegoaliebear,1
"sometimes the deals can be really nice, but you just end up making those savings up anyway when you pay that 60 again haha.",thegoaliebear,1
Dang that seems kinda annoying. So if someone's playing an online game it's basically a +10 to the base price,RonInDune,1
I’m pretty sure if it’s f2p you don’t need ps+,Teddy,1
Not really. Depends on how many online games you play,Arixama,1
True true,RonInDune,1
"That's correct, teddy",Arixama,1
yeah. don't need it for f2p. but as far as i know all the games i have that have multiplayer you need it.,thegoaliebear,1
I wonder if you’ll need ps+ for new light/shadowkeep?,Teddy,1
ah so for something like PlanetSide 2 you won't need the extra price,RonInDune,1
"Right, but for cod, destiny, overwatch and other games like that you would",Arixama,1
also what other large f2p online console games are there? I'm assuming dota/league/starcraft etc. aren't on consoles,RonInDune,1
Fortnite,Teddy,1
Apex,Teddy,1
ohhhh,RonInDune,1
yeah I forgot those are completely free,RonInDune,1
Warframe,Teddy,1
"Tera, ffxiv",Arixama,1
Well,Arixama,1
Ffxiv is free to start,Arixama,1
"never played a final fantasy game, did like the spirits within movie though",RonInDune,1
Man I should really get back into FFXIV,Teddy,1
maybe I'll give it a shot,RonInDune,1
destiny kinda consumes my gaming life whenever there's a content drop,RonInDune,1
Ffxiv is a wow style mmo,Arixama,1
"Teddy, you play on ps4?",Arixama,1
I played it on both,Teddy,1
Did you need psplus for the ps4 version?,Arixama,1
I had ps+,Teddy,1
So I’m not sure,Teddy,1
"It seems like it'd be silly to require ps+ for a subscription game, so I would hope not",Arixama,1
So I googled it you don’t need ps+ for ff,Teddy,1
Well that's good,Arixama,1
"Hmm this is interesting if true: 
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/destiny-2-crossplay-might-be-coming-sooner-than-you-think-1",RonInDune,1
I wonder if there are any truly crossplay shooter games out there,RonInDune,1
Fortnite,Arixama,1
Woah fortnite netcode seems to be super advanced,RonInDune,1
"Not a shooter, but I believe minecraft is also fully cross play now on the Bedrock edition?",Arixama,1
Twab is out and it's very interesting,Trissin,1
Here's a link: http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48141,Trissin,1
The weapon mod thing is kinda useful,RonInDune,1
Holy carp,RonInDune,1
"Oh man soooo many changes to exotics, you're right @Trissin this was very interesting",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I wonder what the meta is gonna be like",Trissin,1
Unfortunately I don't think scout rifles quite received the buff we hoped for @Matos,Trissin,1
"I'm also very curious what the ||raid challenges|| are going to be, and what loot we get from it 👀",Trissin,1
hmm maybe complete the game ||blindfolded|| or using only ||Rock band drum sticks||,RonInDune,1
hope they change it. I'm sick of bounties for raid challenges and I'm sick of not getting individual emblems for them too lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"^^ yeah, emblems would be nice",Trissin,1
"Speaking of, I'd like to see the Garden Day 1 emblem",Trissin,1
@Trissin UUGGGHHHHH,Matos,1
"Also with SMGs buffed and recluse untouched, year 3 meta will be the same as year two",Matos,1
Just as the year 2 meta was the same as the year 1 meta until pinnacle weapons,Matos,1
secretly hoping polaris lance is gonna be a top tier weapon since it refunds bullets to the mag,Trissin,1
looks like the ||raid weapon is a quest|| which is fantastic,Teddy,1
much better than nasty ass RNG.,thegoaliebear,1
I wonder how difficult it will be,Trissin,1
I don't think something as important as the raid exotic should be easily obtainable,Trissin,1
i agree,Teddy,1
but it shouldn't be an RNG drop,Teddy,1
I agree with that,Trissin,1
I guess we'll see what the quest looks like,Trissin,1
I'm sure Bungie has thought about this problem too,Trissin,1
it should be as hard as Outbreak Prime and Touch of Malice was to get,Teddy,1
"yeah the acrius and sleeper quests were fine, that should be their model",RonInDune,1
I think ToM is a bit overboard,Trissin,1
I felt that was a little bit much,Trissin,1
How hard was touch of Malice?,RonInDune,1
"It wasn't hard, it was more just tedious",Trissin,1
You had to collect a bunch of calcified fragments,Trissin,1
so was Outbreak if not more,Teddy,1
Ah so lots of kills to get drops? Yeah that sounds annoying,RonInDune,1
Not kills,Trissin,1
It's like collecting dead ghosts in d2,Trissin,1
nah they were collectables,Teddy,1
I remember grinding the mercury weapons were a bit boring,RonInDune,1
they are just hidden around,Trissin,1
ohhhh,RonInDune,1
"Maybe that's just me, I don't really like searching and collecting stuff lol",Trissin,1
some were in the raid some were not,Teddy,1
"I think i've filled like, maybe 20% of my lore triumphs",Trissin,1
that's probably an overestimate,Trissin,1
lol,Teddy,1
i have every lore triumph,Teddy,1
😮,Trissin,1
chronicler??,Trissin,1
yep,Teddy,1
"damn, congrats",Trissin,1
chronicler and then some,Arixama,1
we've got quite a few chroniclers here on the pc side as well,Trissin,1
i'm not one of them,Trissin,1
i did the dead ghost when i was bored one day,Teddy,1
I have all lore tabs done as well I love doing them!,RonInDune,1
"I don't know, I guess i'm just not interested enough in the lore",Trissin,1
"Do you guys read the flavour text on armor, weapons, etc?",Trissin,1
All the time!,RonInDune,1
i dont.,Arixama,1
i just wanted the tab completed,Arixama,1
"I've looked at a few, but I rarely read through the whole thing",Trissin,1
lol @Arixama,Trissin,1
nope lol,Teddy,1
Although I know some of them are definitely very interesting. Are there any you particularly like @RonInDune ?,Trissin,1
i read the lore books on my phone at work when im bored,Teddy,1
oh hyeah hang on lemme lose this quickplay real quick,RonInDune,1
The Stolen Intelligence books are pretty good in following up on past stories and raids and stuff: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-stolen-intelligence,RonInDune,1
"The story of Orin, of the IX, is collected in two books: Dust and Ecdysis, both are just the right kind of mysterious",RonInDune,1
"i did read all the ones that you get from thorn, lw, and lumina as well as all of the ones from drifter",Arixama,1
it basically just depends on how you aquire them for me,Arixama,1
And one of my favourites is the story of Uldren (and Jolyon/Petra/Mara/everyone he loved) in The Forsaken Prince: https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-the-forsaken-prince,RonInDune,1
which I think eveyrone gets just through the story,RonInDune,1
"A sad coda to this book can be found in the lore tab of Supremacy, the sniper rifle",RonInDune,1

Gotta flex them titles,Teddy,1
"It's fantastic and was written by Seth Dickinson, who's a great author",RonInDune,1
I have the book,Teddy,1
It’s dope,Teddy,1
Yeah I can't wait for Volume 2,RonInDune,1
I didn't buy the comic collection cause I've been pretty hit or miss with graphic novels and don't want to waste more money lol,RonInDune,1
I literally forgot I preordered it lol,Teddy,1
I was surprised when it came,Teddy,1
oh man that was a good surprise,RonInDune,1

"Update to the TWAB posted yesterday: not sure if people have seen this, but minor enemies are getting buffed. This little bit was edited in ~ 2 hours after the TWAB release yesterday:",Trissin,1
might make full auto weapons be more useful,RonInDune,1
Makes minor spec a better mod,Arixama,1
It depends on how much of a precision multiplier hit they take,Oathbreaker,1
Or weapons like huckleberry/bad juju for cleaning out big ad groups,RonInDune,1
oh true true,RonInDune,1
don't think i've ever actually used minor spec,RonInDune,1
:o,Trissin,1
"Also, how do I get rampage spec? I put in the one I have into my god roll blast furnace and I don't want to dismantle it",RonInDune,1
Ada,Arixama,1
ah thanks,RonInDune,1
If it ends up being quite a bit of precision damage lost then it might actually matter but I don't think it will,Oathbreaker,1
I believe 50%,Trissin,1
"And then after that, extra precision damage will be dependent on weapon types",Trissin,1
Hmm,Oathbreaker,1
I don't know if it'll affect most guns as much as people think,Oathbreaker,1
I could be wrong,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, it's not going to be huge - pretty sure most weapons that aren't full auto have been tuned to have enough bonus precision damage that they still one tap minors",Trissin,1
"But that's like, regular minors",Trissin,1
"I imagine high score nightfalls are gonna be a lot more difficult if midnight coup or austringer, etc. don't one tap redbars",Trissin,1
I mean all it takes is one damage buff or another,Oathbreaker,1
Imagine taking two shots to kill the infinite shadow thralls in whisper! 😱 😰,RonInDune,1
Wish we could put shaders on some exotic weapons,RonInDune,1
Is that two tailed fox?,RonInDune,1
"sorry, it was an ornament, not shader. and yes",Thawxtem,1
That sunshot looks so good!,RonInDune,1
Which one? Lol,Trissin,1
bottom center ight,RonInDune,1
Those are some weird edits,Arixama,1
The sunshot ornaments are pretty good anyway,RonInDune,1

"real quick- the time is fast approaching, and I was wondering where to look on Steam to make sure battle.net is properly connected for transfer",Thawxtem,1
"Can't find it on steam, but bungie.net tells you when you're logged in to your account",Arixama,1
bungie.net or battle.net?,Thawxtem,1

I'm pretty sure that's the bungie site,Arixama,1

@Trissin @Arixama,Matos,1
From the subreddit with updated values. It's from a spreadsheet,Matos,1
Izanagis and stupid swords.,Matos,1
Might be time to skip shadowkeep before I have to equip a sword.,Matos,1
😉,Matos,1
"I'm really excited to use Izanagi's more, I like that gun a lot",Trissin,1
And swords are gonna be really interesting lol,Trissin,1
I wonder if we'll see any new exotic swords,Trissin,1
"Worldline is more for the utility, I think, and I don't know too much about black talon, but I think it fires too slowly to be viable",Trissin,1
"If the new raid boss for Garden can be hit with melee swords, it might be worth it to put down a bubble and just slash away",Trissin,1
I'll keep it in mind lol,Trissin,1
Speaking of Izanagi's anyone down for a heroic menagerie run this weekend?,RonInDune,1
I still have no idea what to main for shadowkeep. Nothing is jumping out at me.,Matos,1
Go middle arc hunter for a change and kill enemies by deflection only,RonInDune,1
Go for an orc paladin.,Arixama,1
Or a lalafell pugilist.,Arixama,1
I'd say Titan but I know you don't wanna be stuck on bubble,Trissin,1
That wouldn't be the case within our clan but I fear it would be on any lfg,Trissin,1
Hey @RonInDune if you have a spot you’re looking to fill I’d be interested in trying for that catalyst,Crizum,1
And nobody should ever go lalafell >_>,Crizum,1
Well that makes two of us!,RonInDune,1
if i had the AP...i always love doing heroic menagerie haha.,thegoaliebear,1
but i think they give the AP to forsaken owners for free come october 1.,thegoaliebear,1
"Think so, it’s confusing the way the season pass will work with cross save",Crizum,1
ap is given to forsake owners on tuesday,Arixama,1
we were talking about it the other day and it seems like they're making it so season licenses transfer. so all you have to buy twice is the base SK expansion.,thegoaliebear,1
@Arixama WHAT.,thegoaliebear,1
*Shaxx voice* THIS IS AMAZING.,thegoaliebear,1
17th im pretty sure,Arixama,1
"The seasons will transfer if you buy it on main I think, unless they fixed it, but yeah only buying the pass on one",Crizum,1
i would *love* if it was the 17th. i want to do the ap stuff on pc so badly.,thegoaliebear,1
And yeah looks like the 17tg,Crizum,1
that's awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
i wonder how it will work when i start buying the stuff on pc only and stop using playatation tho. like i wish they had a complete account transfer of sorts ya know.,thegoaliebear,1
"honestly, if it ends up being if you buy on your main account season access transfers, itll just be better for you to buy the licenses on ps4 and play on pc",Arixama,1
If you buy on PS4 it’ll transfer since PS4 is your “main”,Crizum,1
But if you buy on pc it’ll be pc only,Crizum,1
"i think by the next big dlc release or game, the ps5 will be out and I'm not getting that haha. at least not soon after it launches.",thegoaliebear,1
it's just weird thinking about getting the stuff on pc for characters on a platform I'm not gonna play lol.,thegoaliebear,1
ill definitely be interested to see how they handle next gen stuff,Arixama,1
"for sure. bc like...if I'm not getting the ps5, then will I still keep my characters? like how does that work specifically.",thegoaliebear,1
"I want a proper VR implementation too, once it's in steam",RonInDune,1
Does Destiny work with PSVR at all?,RonInDune,1
i don't believe so.,thegoaliebear,1
bit of a shame,RonInDune,1
Destiny in VR would be pretty nutty haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Imagine how much a stompes hunter would make you sick,Crizum,1
Too few games have done VR well still,RonInDune,1
Superhot/Deracine/Resident Evil come to mind,RonInDune,1
Imagine going through Shattered throne in VR,RonInDune,1
i feel like Destiny could be real disorienting in VR. especially when it comes to multiplayer stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
true true,RonInDune,1
re7 is *ok* in vr,Arixama,1
"it was stressful enough in normal, VR would've killed me",RonInDune,1
the big issue is there are moments that are decently scary that become less so because of the way they have to build it in vr and you feel more disconnected to the character,Arixama,1
"specifcally when you get your hand cut off in the beginning, your arms arent fully attached where they should be and so it doesnt actually *feel* like its your hand",Arixama,1
huh interesting,RonInDune,1
wonder if something like Amnesia or outlast would've worked better,RonInDune,1
did P.T. work in VR?,RonInDune,1
"also if you die to chainsaw mia and she cuts you in half, they just kind of fade the screen out instead of showing the chainsaw actually go up the middle",Arixama,1
oof,RonInDune,1
i believe pt came out before psvr was a thing,Arixama,1
"re7 is a very good game, and translates pretty well to vr, but because of some of the design choices that they had to make to make it acessible, its not as spooky as it could have been.",Arixama,1
"doom vfr is a very good vr game, as well as farpoint and i expect you to die",Arixama,1
since i get the AP on tuesday i'd love to run some heroic menagerie if people want the izanagi's catalyst or just funsies.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm extremely down for that,RonInDune,1
I’d be down,Crizum,1
I'm definitely down,Arixama,1
awesome. which day works best for yall. i can be on any night by like 9:30ish EST.,thegoaliebear,1
I can make any day work around 6ish pst,Crizum,1

@Thawxtem Plus heroic gives you the sword anyway,RonInDune,1
So we can do another run next week after st,RonInDune,1
@Crizum I don’t understand what you mean by ignore the current curse. It’s kinda important to unlock the dungeon.,Thawxtem,1

:(((( I know how you feel @RonInDune,Trissin,1
Your emblem inspires me to never give up lol,RonInDune,1

I'm at 35/40,LW Mugetsu,1
Ah okay,Trissin,1
"What I did was speed run the lost sector in futurescape, killing ONLY the boss, and then letting the cursed thrall blow me up",Trissin,1
That respawns you at the entrance if you didn't clear the adds,Trissin,1
And then you can leave and re enter,Trissin,1

Wrath was where the original outbreak prime came form right?,RonInDune,1

"Yeah it was, kinda hoping Shadowkeep brings back Touch of Malice",Crizum,1

"It used to be hard, it just now that we'v significantly outleveled the enemies and we have better weapons",RonInDune,1

"even though we are overleveled and have good gear, it still gets really difficult",Trissin,1
level 7 requires everyone to be able to take out one of those big servitors on their own,Trissin,1
That 1KV will come in clutch,RonInDune,1
"hahaha indeed, it might be pretty useful",Trissin,1
So that means I should do the bow?,Thawxtem,1
"Here @Thawxtem this is the best infographic:  you can practice the steps beforehand
https://imgur.com/a/qQjV9zI",RonInDune,1
The last step is the worst,RonInDune,1
yeah the blind shooting is a bit scary because you arent sure if you messed up,Trissin,1
Yeah I went back and practiced it a bunch before starting the encounter,RonInDune,1
Got it wrong every single time,RonInDune,1
"ahh it's okay, if you give it a few tries you'll get it im sure",Trissin,1
"Hey Ron, anytime you get on, I would love some help with this ""practice."" I tried to read the info-graphics and towards the end it was slowly starting to make less sense.",Thawxtem,1
"Alright I'm just leaving work, so I'll be on in an hour at most",RonInDune,1
"alright, thanks. gives me time to eat beforehand",Thawxtem,1
Sorry guys my laptop overheated and shut down,RonInDune,1
Gimme a few minutes,RonInDune,1
Shadowkeep is officially only 2 weeks away! :shock: :travelergoogly: :mind_blown: :destiny: :zoomeyes: :Pickaxe: :1_:,Pentan,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ 2 spots still open for heroic menagerie tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
Might be able to? I have class from 6-9 but it's a CAD lab which in theory should mean I'm done far sooner than 9,Oathbreaker,1
sweet.,thegoaliebear,1
"so with the new vidoc I'm wondering: as long as i don't delete my playstation account or unlink it from bungie, I will be able to keep those characters through cross save on PC even after next gen consoles come out?",thegoaliebear,1
"just thinking in terms of Bungie seeming like they aren't going to release a new ""game"" any time soon.",thegoaliebear,1
"Everything is tied to the Bungie account, so you should be good to go there",Crizum,1
"Also lots of area spoilers in the ViDoc, be warmed",RonInDune,1
"||The dungeon looks like something form Prince of Persia, I'm v hyped||",RonInDune,1
"so um...now that I'm switching to PC, who knows if they'll be available for a day one raid attempt?",thegoaliebear,1
"I might be in the same boat as oathbreaker, night classes, but we'll see if I'm able to get out early",the_drake1997,1
"Raids releases on a Saturday so I should be around, just let me know what class to focus on for leveling",Crizum,1
i have a game that day but it's in the afternoon. so i should be available from like 7:30pm EST onward. would love to get a group going for that to check it out.,thegoaliebear,1
Working that weekend sadly,Oathbreaker,1
So no can do for me,Oathbreaker,1
we got time haha. just would be good to get a team together that can stick together for a first clear as a clan.,thegoaliebear,1
When is reset?,CrizMobius,1
1pm EST i think. or is it noon?,thegoaliebear,1
should it be like 40 min ago?,CrizMobius,1
10 minutes from now I think,Crizum,1
kk,CrizMobius,1
But there is maintenance today until 2 pst I think,Crizum,1
10 minutes from now,Oathbreaker,1
annual pass,thegoaliebear,1
Just got on and looks fine. No maintenance or nothing,the_drake1997,1
if only I didn't have class until 7:45 :(,thegoaliebear,1
Heck yeah hotfix,RonInDune,1
Oooooh nice,Trissin,1
and it's the week to farm sole survivor too,Trissin,1
Get that firing line,Crizum,1
aw yeah,Trissin,1
Hey does the official app ever show stats wrong? Cause it’s showing my triple tap firing line combo as outlaw snapshot sights >_>,Crizum,1
Yeah my sole survivor with opening shot/4th time is my go to sniper,RonInDune,1
😮 that's the role we're looking for,Trissin,1
I think API is down for maintainence,RonInDune,1
I have a beloved with no distractions/moving target that I'm not certain how good it is,RonInDune,1
"I'm fairly potato with every roll, so opening shot is essential for me lol",RonInDune,1
I'm really bad with snipers in pvp as well,Trissin,1
Only time I ever used a sniper in pvp was for IB quest,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
I still need like 100 sniper kills for revoker,RonInDune,1
only time i used snipers was for Revoker haha.,thegoaliebear,1
i have a Beloved with firmly planted/box breathing so...hard scoping for days lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48150

@Chronicler",Trissin,1
My greatest sniper kill was using whisper to one shot body shot  two golden guns from inside a well,RonInDune,1
Nothing will ever live up to that,RonInDune,1
😮,Trissin,1
"Bloody hell, ||Eris is taunting Savathûn to her face|| She's got some chutzpah",RonInDune,1
Eris is a bad bitch that's why.,thegoaliebear,1
she's pretty pretty cool,RonInDune,1
Eris:,thegoaliebear,1
:BAha:,Arixama,1
Is it wrong to want to see Eris and the Drifter interact?,Crizum,1
eris would make the drifter cry.,thegoaliebear,1
she's too powerful.,thegoaliebear,1
Bet Eris knows the best way to season hive meat,RonInDune,1
LOL,Trissin,1
"Eris' cultural impact:
⬛
⬛
⬛
⬛

The drifters impact:
_",thegoaliebear,1
"This is a GOAT line, from ||Eris to Savathûn||",RonInDune,1
hands were thrown.,thegoaliebear,1
"Even worse than Cayde's ""How's your sister?"" to Uldren IMO",RonInDune,1
talking a pretty big game for someone who is gonna sic a god slaying mute at the problem like everyone else haha,Crizum,1
That was Mara and Eris's plan the whole time lol,RonInDune,1
From https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/tyrannocide-v,RonInDune,1
I love the Tyrannocide lore pieces. They're *the bomb*,RonInDune,1
woah I didn't know you couldn't revive in the prestige modes of D1 raids,RonInDune,1
That's ridiculous,RonInDune,1
"Hahaha, yeah it’s why they have the token system now. Tons of fun",Crizum,1
Warlock self-res and grenade spamming Aetheon off a cliff was beautiful,Crizum,1
hard mode raids in d1 elevated your game i think.,thegoaliebear,1
was it a fun mechanic? there'd be lots of waiting around,RonInDune,1
if someone died part way through an encounter you get really good at 5 manning and even 4 manning lots of stuff. one time in Wrath me and a guy two manned aksis phase 1 because everyone else died.,thegoaliebear,1
bloody hell,RonInDune,1
"I'm watching datto and company do all the raids in prestige, and it's interesting how similar VoG is to CoS",RonInDune,1
yeah VoG is a lot of standing around waiting for things to happen lol.,thegoaliebear,1
also blue engrams drop legendaries for some reason??? wat,RonInDune,1
"Engrams could decrypt at higher levels, you could get exotics from purpled",Crizum,1
Purples*,Crizum,1
??_??,RonInDune,1
weird,RonInDune,1
"And you had to decrypt things, Rahool is a shadow of his former troll self",Crizum,1
"also they're sleepering themselves to death inside a bubble, I'm gonna try that in D2",RonInDune,1
Hoping with weapons of light coming back they bring back the Glasshouse,Crizum,1
What's that?,RonInDune,1
Made weapons and armor of light last longer,Crizum,1
oh that looks great!,RonInDune,1
i love when people who didn't play d1 discover great things about it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
this is so pure.,thegoaliebear,1
Honestly being in this clan makes me wish I had searched for an actual clan in d1,Arixama,1
how was the LFG during D1? did the mobile client and everything else exist?,RonInDune,1
also the run through the darkness in Crota's End is amazing,RonInDune,1
I have no idea. Any LFG I did was handled by someone else,Arixama,1
LFG in D1 was usually external sites like the 100.io or destinylfg.com as one example,Oathbreaker,1
There was a fireteams section on the Bungie forums but it was hit or miss at times,Oathbreaker,1
Reddit and mutual friends,Crizum,1
or r/fireteams,Oathbreaker,1
yeah i used r/fireteams,Teddy,1
huh shriekers had like kamikaze bombs after they died,RonInDune,1
destinylfg was full of kids lol,Teddy,1
was discord up yet? lemme check,RonInDune,1
ok crota was Jan 2015 and discord was May of that year,RonInDune,1
I used Discord a few times back then on a few different servers,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh hey @RonInDune, look up Randal the vandal",Crizum,1
big yes ^,thegoaliebear,1
This guy? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUm6IQTeHGM,RonInDune,1
"In D1, also had a reference in wrath of the machines",Crizum,1
"Nah, OG Randal the Vandal",Oathbreaker,1
Rahndal was his cousin,Oathbreaker,1
Considerably less beefy cousin,Oathbreaker,1
ok this is funny,RonInDune,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1LujNOkKSs,RonInDune,1
poor guy,RonInDune,1
Always hated that vandal for causing me trouble during the public event. Never realized it was a D1 meme,Thawxtem,1
Wait is he aggressive?,Trissin,1
you can see all the battle pass stuff now https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfTheUndying,Teddy,1
i like that they confirm the season passes transfer over. battle pass seems neat tho.,thegoaliebear,1
Looks like if you buy the digital deluxe on one system and the normal version on another you’ll get silver?,Crizum,1
i'm really not sure what that part meant lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"does it give you the silver value to ""purchase"" each season on whatever platform you don't have digital deluxe?",thegoaliebear,1
Would be whichever version you log in to second,Crizum,1
"Deluxe comes with the pass which is seasons 8-11, if you buy the normal on another system you get a season but since it’s going beyond season 11 they just give you silver",Crizum,1
Which I guess you could keep for future seasons,Crizum,1
"that's...kind of weird ?? if the season pass transfers via cross save, then they're basically just giving us free currency lol.",thegoaliebear,1
but i won't complain haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah I think it’s just future proofing, if Shadowkeep is our last big expansion and seasons is how they’ll have content drops going forward",Crizum,1
makes sense. especially if seasons can be purchased with silver that will be really convenient. and also for those super tempted by EV exclusive stuff haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"so that cool Vex armor is from the battle pass, which i appreciate lol.",thegoaliebear,1
"As far as they've said, currently their aim is to do a shadowkeep sized expansion every year, with supporting seasons for the rest of that yeat",Arixama,1
They might wait for the next Console generation to really build a Destiny 3. Plus there might be other publishers in the offering,RonInDune,1
"Imagine if Apple buys back Bungie, going back to their origin",RonInDune,1
was just about to mention that. i am curious to see how they will handle next gen consoles considering they're likely to release next year around holiday time.,thegoaliebear,1
"Destiny 3, exclusive to PS5 and Apple iPad",RonInDune,1
LOL,thegoaliebear,1
you gotta love it,RonInDune,1
want to play online on iPad? just buy an Apple Music subscription for unlimited access!,thegoaliebear,1
want to hear audio? Buy the revolutionary and proprietary 300$ Apple iHeads,RonInDune,1
want to be able to download the game in the first place? buy an $800 SSD expansion!,thegoaliebear,1
"game has bugs? email Tim Cook directly and get a response ""you're holding it wrong""",RonInDune,1
hahaha. jesus i really hate Apple 😂,thegoaliebear,1
"I liked their early devices far more than their modern ones! My 10 year old iPad 2 and 12 year old iPod Classic works fine, while a 2 year old Mac Pro is absolutely falling apart and 2 year old iphones have shite battery life",RonInDune,1
They're absolutely cursed,RonInDune,1
macbooks are so incredibly overrated and overpriced i cannot believe lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
extremely agreed,RonInDune,1
Apple getting ready to push the self-destruct button for any iPhone less than the 10 now that they're releasing the 11 hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
"""Planned obsolescence""",RonInDune,1
lolol deadass.,thegoaliebear,1
i might be on closer to 9:45 for heroic menagerie btw. got some work i gotta finish.,thegoaliebear,1
So like 2-ish hours from now?,RonInDune,1
That sounds fine,RonInDune,1
yup,thegoaliebear,1
https://tenor.com/view/excited-modernfamily-shake-fabulous-gif-4256378,thegoaliebear,1
when u see all that annual pass content available.,thegoaliebear,1
raid marathon time,Arixama,1
yayaya,thegoaliebear,1
jk that assignment took way less time than i thought haha. i'm fine to play whenever people are ready.,thegoaliebear,1
im good to go whenever,Arixama,1
Just eating real quick but good whenever,Crizum,1
I'm ready,RonInDune,1
cool. do we have a full group for heroic?,thegoaliebear,1
@Oathbreaker you around?,Arixama,1
oh for heroic,Oathbreaker,1
?,Oathbreaker,1
yeah,Arixama,1
Sorry I've been doing QA work all day then CAD shit so didn't know if we had a full group,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah I can hang around for a bit,Oathbreaker,1
cool.,thegoaliebear,1
think we need one more still.,thegoaliebear,1
Did someone invoke me?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Fuck i should rebrand to that,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg search,Arixama,1
Who are we joining up on?,Crizum,1
I'm in orbit rn.,thegoaliebear,1
you can send a friend request if you want I'm goaliebear#1614,thegoaliebear,1
we are in raid channel.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I’m heading home if you guys still need a 6th,Thawxtem,1
@Thawxtem perfect.,thegoaliebear,1
bring warlock or hunter.,thegoaliebear,1
Warlock. Subclass?,Thawxtem,1
Well. have lunas and phoenix depending what the others wanna do aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I regularly hold both,Thawxtem,1
perfect. we're gonna do the flawless strat with outbreak and swords for the boss but not going for flawless haha.,thegoaliebear,1
would anyone being willing to help me on the thorn mission,Chance,1
2 manning is hard,Chance,1
is that the Titan mission?,Thawxtem,1
yeah,Chance,1
we were 2 manning just fine but bosses last phase is a struggle,Chance,1
"I am on that step as well; I can go later, but right now I'm doing heroic menagerie",Thawxtem,1
aight,Chance,1
Alright Izanagi catalyst completed!,RonInDune,1
niceu,Chance,1

yes that's why i was able to do menagerie yesterday haha.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear Welcome to the PC family!,Matos,1
thanks!💯,thegoaliebear,1
Hello everyone!,Sharky,1
Thanks for the add btw,Sharky,1
“Goal joins the battle”,Pentan,1
yayaya🔥,thegoaliebear,1
Can someone from the pc group send an invite to LwMugetsu#1458,LW Mugetsu,1
on blizzard or for the PC clan?,thegoaliebear,1
Yes ma'am,LW Mugetsu,1
send join request for PC here: https://www.bungie.net/en/ClanV2?groupid=2840602,thegoaliebear,1
anyone want to do a raid tomorrow night?,thegoaliebear,1
Sure,RonInDune,1
i don't have a preference lol. guess if people need a challenge or something that's cool too.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm donw for any raid, would prefer some Scourge runs for anarchy though!",RonInDune,1
Around what time?,Crizum,1
scourge is good. i should be able to get on around 9:30ish EST.,thegoaliebear,1
"I’d be down, need that anarchy haha",Crizum,1
sweet.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ raid tomorrow night for those who want.,thegoaliebear,1
"I wish we could use icarus dash constantly, would make it so much more useful",RonInDune,1
I will be on,LW Mugetsu,1
@LW Mugetsu if you can do the raid tomorrow night add yourself to the lfg post.,thegoaliebear,1
Well,Oathbreaker,1
My mouse may have just stopped working,Oathbreaker,1
oh no!,RonInDune,1
Drivers are no longer being recognized by windows,Oathbreaker,1
"as a result any and all binds I've set on the mouse no longer work, except for the most basic of functions",Oathbreaker,1
Tried to restart my computer about 3 times,Oathbreaker,1
No dice,Oathbreaker,1
testing on my laptop appears to have it working,Oathbreaker,1
yeah only happening on desktop,Oathbreaker,1
idk what's going on,Oathbreaker,1
:( what kind of mouse do you have?,thegoaliebear,1
I might be able to join depending on what time my classes end,the_drake1997,1
@the_drake1997 i don't mind starting a little later if need be. don't have classes on fridays so i can be up later aha.,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune I’ll get Anarchy this time so you can get it next time,Thawxtem,1
Every fingers crossed,RonInDune,1
G502,Oathbreaker,1
hm...did they release any driver updates for that mouse? but it's weird that it just stopped yet still worked with your laptop.,thegoaliebear,1
"Alright, this is just dumb. Figured it out. Logitech Gaming Software, the old software that worked fine until today has just shit the bed entirely. I now have to use GHUB and redo all my keybinds for every game I play.",Oathbreaker,1
^^,RonInDune,1
I've checked the drivers on LGS. They're the newest release. Windows doesn't recognize the drivers anymore though.,Oathbreaker,1
"So annoying, Windows had gotten better about drivers lately, but there's no fixing some stuff I guess",RonInDune,1
Alright it won’t let me join the event but I’m down for raid tomorrow. I have 0 clues as to what anarchy is though.,Pentan,1
Thanks Ghost,Pentan,1
anarchy is just the raid exotic @Pentan,thegoaliebear,1
The raid exotics are the only weapons I'm missing,LW Mugetsu,1
Anarchy seems nice. Did a crown of sorrows with a guy that said if you have it equipped he’d kick you because he didn’t like cheese haha,Crizum,1
That's wack,Trissin,1
It saves so much time,Trissin,1
"I could understand that mind set fo riven, but for crown it's a little silly.",Arixama,1
"My mindset is this, if people don’t cheese how are others gonna feel morally superior?",Crizum,1
Lol he was probably mad because he doesn’t have it,Teddy,1
“I got it and I immediately shared it” was his statement. Which means nothing cause collections hahaha,Crizum,1
Sharded*,Crizum,1
"He actually kicked like four people throughout that run for various things, that was the moment I thought “Yeah I should just find a clan...”",Crizum,1
i think it's silly when people hate raid strats lmao. like...sorry people don't always have time to do full runs.,thegoaliebear,1
"I’ll always be cool running raids with first timers, teaching/learning strats and roles but sometimes I only have 30 minutes and I want to stand in the Warlock puddle and pew pew",Crizum,1
"like obviously anyone's first time through a raid should learning it legit. but once you're good at it, it's totally fine to do an easier strat for time conservation and farming.",thegoaliebear,1
I've only ran last wish once the legit way and I was the leg person of the group.,LW Mugetsu,1
The Xbox portion of the clan has a tough time getting raids together,LW Mugetsu,1
"yeah I've been told haha. i mean, real life is a thing, and in those cases cheeses or easy strats are the best option.",thegoaliebear,1
for when you do end up getting something together.,thegoaliebear,1
"I have no problem doing raids either way, but cheese goes faster and there is less to remember",LW Mugetsu,1
exactly. i don't always wanna have to think about what I'm doing lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Lol. First time I did last wish all they told me was shoot the mouth not the eyes and don't die.,LW Mugetsu,1
i love to hear that😂,thegoaliebear,1
"My first crown I asked mechanics, people said “doesn’t matter shoot crystals” and the only thing I heard was a dude shouting my name and “CRYSTALCRYSTALCRYSTAL”",Crizum,1
Still beat it but it wasn’t until a later run I had any idea of what was happening,Crizum,1
i mean...they weren't wrong tho LOL,thegoaliebear,1
I still haven't run crown yet,LW Mugetsu,1
“GET BLESSING” “wat”,Crizum,1
crystals absolutely the most important thing. everything else you can sort of follow your partner around haha.,thegoaliebear,1
cuff them to your wrist😂,thegoaliebear,1
I think crown is super easy to learn if you're a first timer and you're paired with any experienced person. we can take you through it at some point @LW Mugetsu,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah it’s the easiest mechanics wise I feel,Crizum,1
"Shoot your adds, shoot your crystals, swap with your partner",Crizum,1
yeah it's very procedural.,thegoaliebear,1
The only thing that can screw your run is if people are doo doo at add clear,Crizum,1
for sure. if you're good at that then it's hella easy. sometimes I'd just be standing around waiting bc we killed everything so quick lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm pretty quick on picking up raid mechanics,LW Mugetsu,1
"^^
A lot of people i've played with clear adds quickly and end up with nothing to do, so they'll rush to a different side to try and help out. Then, they get busy there and forget to come back to clear their own side's adds/crystal",Trissin,1
Those acolytes in the very last phase with the boomers are _strong_,Trissin,1
yeahhh haha i ain't do that...handle ya own shit 😜😂😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
unless someone dies tho.,thegoaliebear,1
In all the other raids I had most of them down by my second time,LW Mugetsu,1
"The one thing that guy in my run said that made sense was “I could drop you on Titan and you could find knights, if you’re having trouble killing them I can’t help you”",Crizum,1
Light levels not withstanding,Crizum,1
"the thing i like about crown is because it's so procedural and partner dependent, it really forces you to get acquainted with all the jobs of the encounter.",thegoaliebear,1
"so like, you're not always put into one fixed role and then get confused when you're asked to do something else aha.",thegoaliebear,1
“Who is doing downstairs?” 6 people are silent and have no idea what that entails,Crizum,1
Lol,LW Mugetsu,1
I both like and dislike the idea that everybody has to carry their own weight and that you cant have just one or two people driving the whole encounter,Trissin,1
I agree,LW Mugetsu,1
Makes carries a little more difficult,LW Mugetsu,1
"yeah that's what i like. some raids are super easy to carry like ""just go there and kill things"" but recently it's been getting more about everyone has to be on the same page.",thegoaliebear,1
Hopefully the Shadowkeep raid is last wish level,Crizum,1
Size wise at least,Crizum,1
Super excited for it,Trissin,1
"It should be, yeah",Trissin,1
I hope today's twab reveals some details about it,Trissin,1
I'd imagine it would be yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
"At least the entry requirements, day 1 rewards, etc",Trissin,1
And a trailer would be nice,Trissin,1
one big raid followed by a couple smaller ones has been a good model tbh.,thegoaliebear,1
Like the raid lairs in the leviathian,LW Mugetsu,1
I agree,LW Mugetsu,1
Really want one of those jackets they give for first weekend clears,Crizum,1
i wish i had the time to actually take a shot at day 1 or week 1 clears. i was hoping this could be the time but naturally i have a game the day tue raid launches lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
maybe if there's a raid for the spring season since I'm done with hockey by then😩🙌🙌,thegoaliebear,1
"Man that makes me want to do Eater again. It's a bit too small for a raid, but it is quite entertaining!",RonInDune,1
Especially now that we have people who two manned it!,RonInDune,1
"I don't know if you're talking about me and Oath, but we havent two manned Argos. **yet**",Trissin,1
oh I though you finished it!,RonInDune,1
I saw you guys attempting it after finishing Calus,RonInDune,1
Did you ever try Kali?,RonInDune,1
This time we're going back with our secret weapon,Trissin,1
Mountaintop,Trissin,1
Aha,RonInDune,1
"We didn't try Kalli, no",Trissin,1
Maybe we will in the future,Trissin,1
I'd actually really like to try gahlran too,Trissin,1
hopefuly before the lunas nerf,Trissin,1
I got some busy days ahead of me but we can do it,Oathbreaker,1
but we're both pretty busy now,Trissin,1
yeah absolutely,Trissin,1
You busy tomorrow?,Oathbreaker,1
I finish classes at around 7 ET,Trissin,1
Hm,Oathbreaker,1
I work at 9am the next day,Oathbreaker,1
Ah,Trissin,1
oh apparently Jotunn has a massive close range damage boost bug,RonInDune,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8BbjOk7SwE,RonInDune,1
apparently you can one shot dul incaru using the right combination of buffs and Jotunn now,RonInDune,1
Sweats in Gambit be like,Crizum,1
@RonInDune i enjoy a celestial goldy to the face. but I'd like to try the jotunn thing haha.,thegoaliebear,1
If everyone in scourge has jotunns we could try it on prime?,Crizum,1
i would like to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
"of all the weapons I've tried on Dul Incaru, jotunn is the last i'd have though would be viable lol",RonInDune,1
i even one cycled her using outbreak,RonInDune,1
i love the fire toaster haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"it's my go to pvp loadout, blast furnace, jotunn and grenade launcher, while on a titan",RonInDune,1
the dad loadout.,thegoaliebear,1
It’s not too viable but I love running recluse with peacekeepers,Crizum,1
"I actually had some success running peackeepers and the Ikelos SMG, it does insane damage!",RonInDune,1
You move so fast,Crizum,1
"Also tried Tarrabah, but I couldn't get the perk to proc reliably",RonInDune,1
"I dunno if it's a bug, but the Titan exotic armour that gives auto rifle ammo automatically sometimes weirds out with suros regime",RonInDune,1
Wonder if with the buffs a Titan running Actium and Sweet Business will be good for damage,Crizum,1
"i have no idea what role sweet business fits, it just seems bad in every situation",RonInDune,1
"oh wait i understand the message now. i don't run 3 characters any more, so i won't be able to do all 3. i'll just sit this out unless you need someone for one run",Pentan,1
that's totally fine. seems like we'd need a 6th anyway. unless you don't want to do the boss x3 haha.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah that's what i'm saying lol. i'd rather not run it 3 times on just one character,Pentan,1
i'm sure someone will be on that wants to,Pentan,1
look at Buttkikker playing what is objectively and undeniably one of the best games,Pentan,1
"I never could get into Terraria, the artwork just didn't suit me",RonInDune,1
that would be something that stops you from enjoying it ron,Pentan,1
I exclusively play games designed to frustrate and anger me which is why I play Destiny,Crizum,1
you've obviously never played terraria in hardcore expert mode,Pentan,1
"“My blood pressure is doing pretty good, time for some crucible”",Crizum,1
"I had enough toxicity in my life from DOTA 2, never again lol",RonInDune,1
Hahaha did you see they are banning people for low social scores in dota?,Crizum,1
honestly the Destiny community is so much nicer,RonInDune,1
"Nah, you just gotta embrace the fact that crucible is an unbalanced mess",Oathbreaker,1
really? dang that was long overdue,RonInDune,1
"if you haven't noticed, i'm getting into wow now that this classic thing is out. never played it before, but i'm having fun",Pentan,1
"Yeah @RonInDune the community is pretty good, same with FFXIV which is the time sink I alternate with D2",Crizum,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
I though about trying FFXIV but 13$ a month feels too much,RonInDune,1

😳😶😶,thegoaliebear,1
So Eris ||left to explore the stars before Oryx came into the system.||,RonInDune,1
I wonder who ||Mars was meeting in her throne room then||,RonInDune,1
what i decipher through the subtext is this: gay.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh yeah ||Mara is *super* gay||,RonInDune,1
she's too powerful.,thegoaliebear,1
||for literally everyone lol||,RonInDune,1
"every character is, if you really think about it.",thegoaliebear,1
She had a thing with Shaxx,Crizum,1
The helmet stayed on,Crizum,1
also with Sjur.,thegoaliebear,1
and Petra.,thegoaliebear,1
I like the tragic romance between ||Uldren and Jolyon||,RonInDune,1
she is a woman who gets what she wants😜,thegoaliebear,1
^^,RonInDune,1
Imagine Shaxx shouting at you like he does in the crucible,Crizum,1
i respect the hell out of it.,thegoaliebear,1
no.,thegoaliebear,1
😂,thegoaliebear,1
"the first thing that came to mind was ""*THIS IS AMAZING*""",thegoaliebear,1
"“I tell everyone you’re my favorite, SO WHAT”",Crizum,1
and unfortunately i can't unthink that as much as i want to.,thegoaliebear,1
"I mean Shaxx is extremely Pan, remember he married *all of us*",RonInDune,1
https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/the-vow,RonInDune,1
shaxx is an lgbt ICON and we love to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
||https://twitter.com/lazesummerstone/status/1140498616030658561||,RonInDune,1
"i love the last part of that tho. ""someone screams."" like I relate yeah",thegoaliebear,1
Remember the shirtless Shaxx cutout in Bungie's office in the ViDoc?,RonInDune,1
you love to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
"Mara annointing Petra as her wrath was iconic! 
I wish they'd make more cinematics or something, sigh...",RonInDune,1
imagine a full cinematic of that.,thegoaliebear,1
or a comic about them. the *content* 👀,thegoaliebear,1
Can you imagine being any character in Destiny aside from your guardian? You are a super legendary wielder of the light who shoulders a huge burden  and here comes a group of 6 or so people who beat down everything that has ever given you trouble before dabbing over the corpses of gods and yeeting themselves with grenades,Crizum,1
we love that for us.,thegoaliebear,1
Most characters honestly think of us as insane dancing children,RonInDune,1
And they aren't wrong,RonInDune,1
That lore piece about mad dancing guardians is great,Crizum,1
i love when they put shit we do in canon lore.,thegoaliebear,1
The lore in Abide The Return sword references us as well: ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/abide-the-return||,RonInDune,1
Plus this hilarious Cabal report,RonInDune,1
just traded in some ps4 games for extra cash for steam gift cards so i can pre order shadowkeep on pc...only paid $20 for $40 worth of steam credit i love that for me.,thegoaliebear,1
24 hr emblem:,Trissin,1
Contest is also going to active once again:,Trissin,1
good.,thegoaliebear,1
would like to see the actual raid emblem tho haha.,thegoaliebear,1
i actually liked the regular crown emblem more than the day one emblem for it.,thegoaliebear,1
Regular completion emblem,Trissin,1
:o I still think the day 1 crown emblem is the coolest,Trissin,1
"this day 1 garden emblem is a little bit underwhelming, I feel",Trissin,1
okay...that regular emblem is way cooler LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
i love the color scheme.,thegoaliebear,1
"Here's the TWAB:

http://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/48163",Trissin,1
so I'm assuming after the steam migration happens when i log in on steam it will still be my ps4 guardians?,thegoaliebear,1
"Should be yeah, they’ll move your current pc characters but since PS4 is selected as main you’ll still have them",Crizum,1
"sick. i was just wondering if like, I would need to sign into ps4 or whatever lol. it doesn't seem like we need to re download the game then when the migration happens then? unless i missed something about it in there aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"They didn’t say, they’ll have info on preload next week",Crizum,1
Probably will have o download everything again on steam :/,Crizum,1
nice. will still take less time than my ps4 will to download SK and then copy it tho haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm disappointed they didn't show off the jacket,Arixama,1
Still gotta log in ps4 version to attach the season pass to my account,Crizum,1
I’ll just download it while I’m at work and maybe it’ll be 50% copied when I get home,Crizum,1
yeah...that's a pain. I wish I could have gotten a refund but...playstation store💀 I'm just leaving my ps4 on all day for that lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Crizum If you're talking about downloading the season pass, there won't be a download for that.",Arixama,1
just so the licenses transfer i believe is what he meant.,thegoaliebear,1
The wording they used was something along the lines of “once you log in the season is tied to your account” so I at least need to log in once on PS4 before season 9 to get pass credit,Crizum,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
Which is harder than you’d think once you get that first hit of pc gameplay,Crizum,1
Lol,Trissin,1
essentially it's just so the entitlements you have linked to owning digital deluxe (season pass) transfers via the cross save feature.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm still kinda surprised they didn't milk the hell out of that tho haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Oooh the 24 hour emblem looks very much like something from TRON,RonInDune,1
cool,RonInDune,1
i really do think the crown one was a lot cooler though,Trissin,1
I don't like the sotp day one emblem either,Trissin,1
Maybe I'm just picky,Trissin,1
as far as day 1 emblems go yeah it is.,thegoaliebear,1
I don't even remember what sotp day one looks like lol,thegoaliebear,1
yeah it does kinda look like Windows defragmenting,RonInDune,1
I'm just excited to go for another raid title. those are really the only ones I care about lol.,thegoaliebear,1
^^^,Trissin,1
Same,Trissin,1
Let's work together,Trissin,1
bet.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm ready haha,thegoaliebear,1
"Haha, I missed way out on riven slayer blacksmith and shadow so hopefully I can get whatever this new one is",Crizum,1
"I've got the flawless scourge, but I can't bring myself to finish 100 frames and collect 6 rare bounties",Trissin,1
omg the rare bounties more like exotic tbh,Trissin,1
Reckoner/Blacksmith are known to be amongst the worst to complete,RonInDune,1
it's nice because shadow and enlightened are strictly pertaining to the Raids (menagerie in shadow case),thegoaliebear,1
Shadow was by far the best one,RonInDune,1
blacksmith involved too much outside the raid for me to care lmao,thegoaliebear,1
I still gotta get me that shadow title,Arixama,1
"For Rivensbane, some of the raid challenges are a bit overkill, plus the flawless is *hard*",RonInDune,1
rivensbane was ass because of the 1KV RNG invloved.,thegoaliebear,1
All I need for Shadow are the 4 flawless triumphs,RonInDune,1
i had petras run completed 1.5 months before i got 1kv.,thegoaliebear,1
dang,RonInDune,1
go for them @RonInDune !,Trissin,1
Shadow imo is the epitome of a raid/endgame based title.,thegoaliebear,1
I liked shadow too,Trissin,1
No need for tarrabah,Trissin,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
And a fair amount of skill was required for the bosses,Trissin,1
the ogre one took me a few tries,Trissin,1
once the menagerie sword drop was guaranteed it basically eliminated a huge struggle with rng too.,thegoaliebear,1
I just need flawless and limited blessing challenge,Arixama,1
go do the flawless with Ron! And Matos!,Trissin,1
"so it really was made more into a team's skill rather than ""oh so you were lucky with your drops""",thegoaliebear,1
^^^^,Trissin,1
"that reminds me, with the Jotunn bug it's possible go for solo flawless Shattered THrone this week",RonInDune,1
"not saying Petra's was easy, but yeah",Trissin,1
:(((,Trissin,1
but I'm always down to help with the flawless stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
*technically* I need the collections. But I got a lovely glitch where my collections triumph completed when I logged in on xbox,Arixama,1
not sure how I feel about completing such challenges with cheese,Trissin,1
The ST ogre (Vorgeth?) fight has been my nemesis for soooo long,RonInDune,1
Loool,Trissin,1
"I've done everything solo flawless except for that, sigh",RonInDune,1
:(((,Trissin,1
keep trying! It took me a few attempts too,Trissin,1
and God don't get booped off the wall after that because thats happened to me :)),Trissin,1
That's when you alt-f4 on the way down,Arixama,1
"Wait, does that work?",Trissin,1
I thought u couldn't leave in the midfle,Trissin,1
For solo flawless,Trissin,1
Can't even go rally for ammo,Trissin,1
"No idea, but at that point there's nothing to lose anyway",Arixama,1
ah but taken armaments is pretty op here,RonInDune,1
"So we now have 2 pc admins, yeah?",Arixama,1
"not sure if I'm an admin anymore, lol",Trissin,1
I suppose we dont really need 2,Trissin,1
you are an admin haha,thegoaliebear,1
"You are, that's why you have a yellow name 😂",Arixama,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
The other platforms have a least 3 I think.,Arixama,1
the raid's in two hours yeah? hope I don't get flooded out again,RonInDune,1
i don't mind adding another pc admin or two. then you guys can get the admin channel👀,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune yeah around 9:30EST,thegoaliebear,1
"admin channel, oh man",Trissin,1
What nefarious plots are hatched in the admin channel?,RonInDune,1
it's GREAT,thegoaliebear,1
hot tea is what happens there.,thegoaliebear,1
LOL,Trissin,1
i love that for us.,thegoaliebear,1
"as I suspected, mods are evil",RonInDune,1
we have CONTENT.,thegoaliebear,1
but fr fr if you're interested in being a PC admin on Discord and love your tea piping hot lmk.,thegoaliebear,1
"hmm no thanks, I'm extremely liable to go mad with power",RonInDune,1
yeah that's definitely you😜😂,thegoaliebear,1

not even that bad tbh,Trissin,1
"Ooooh, I'd be in for that 😂",Arixama,1
"I'll join, I have the catalyst too lol",Trissin,1
@Oathbreaker can only use swords in all 3 slots,RonInDune,1

nooo not even started,Trissin,1

Mines done. 😜,Arixama,1
?!??????,Trissin,1
Lol when did u finish??,Trissin,1
My buddy and I farmed it out in whisper when his dropped 😂,Arixama,1
"Not ever gonna bother getting Rat King, nor am I gonna bother getting Malfeasance 😤",Oathbreaker,1
But the collectionsssss,Arixama,1
*No*,Oathbreaker,1
isn't there supposed to be a malfeasance catalyst?,Trissin,1
"Actually, aren't there supposed to be a whole bunch",Trissin,1
That we just haven't seen yet,Trissin,1
i'm surprised i actually got malfeasance. used it for a hot minute.,thegoaliebear,1
"Doesn't matter, it's Malfeasance",Oathbreaker,1
which means I could find a better gun in my vault that's known as Service Revolver that is only a Legendary,Oathbreaker,1
"i like how malf looks and feels, it's just a bit useless",RonInDune,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
though i did almost kill roaming supers a bunch of times,RonInDune,1
almost being the operative word,RonInDune,1
Lol,Trissin,1
I know my ps4 friends used to use malfeasance pretty regularly because they'd alway play together and would team shoot,Arixama,1
if it takes multiple of you five or more shots to kill someone,Oathbreaker,1
Either get closer,Oathbreaker,1
Or you need to practice your aim a little more,Oathbreaker,1
No offense meant by the above statement,Oathbreaker,1
oh fully agreed,RonInDune,1
"That's the thing I love about destiny. Things may not be the best, but still viable in a lot of activities",Arixama,1
What am I being volunteered for?,Matos,1
i have no idea but we're doing scourge tonight with x3 at the boss and i believe Pentan only has one character so they don't want to run it 3 times if they'll only get loot once aha.,thegoaliebear,1
so if you want to join...there's a spot lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Sure, when is that happening?",Matos,1
930 EST.,thegoaliebear,1

i would like to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
isn't like 2/3rds of the clan a warlock main?,Pentan,1
"warlocks rule, hunters drool!",RonInDune,1
We've got mostly locks and hunters yeah,Arixama,1
Those are fighting words Ron..... You wanna take that into the Crucible and settle this?,Oathbreaker,1
"won't be able to make the run tonight, some buddies need help on FF14 > <",Matos,1
"i was about to say, the ones that aren't warlock mains are the crucible boys",Pentan,1
Nah. We've got a decent amount of hunter mains. And a fair few switches too.,Arixama,1
Buttkikker and I are trying to take down fargos mod masochist mode moonlord. This fight is brutal.,Nahkriin,1
@Matos no worries.,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to do scourge with boss phase two x3?,thegoaliebear,1
@LW Mugetsu we are in raid chat if you still want to do the raid runs.,thegoaliebear,1
@Nahkriin @Buttkikker i can barely handle moonlord on expert vanilla. i don't mess with modded terraria much but that sounds nuts,Pentan,1

"You guys are fucking dope. Congrats on admin @Arixama !!

Hopefully all goes well with getting and putting together my pc this weekend and I can try out the pc side of destiny. Would love to meet some of ya. I’ll still devote time to ps4, but gonna at least give it a whirl here",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
for sure would love to have ya join in with some PC stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
"Since cross save I've actually been more active on the ps4 side honestly. That's definitely going to change with shadowkeep, but I intend to hop between both.",Arixama,1
Cool. You liking pc? Seems like the clan on pc side of things is really revving up lately,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
yeah i mean overall everyone is in a bit of a lull while we wait for shadowkeep haha. but i've been enjoying the hell out of playing on pc now.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh, I've been playing on pc since warmind. Started d2 on Ps4 back in vanilla and fell off cause everyone I played with fell off. Now I've got my real life destiny people here in the ps4 clan and some of us did all three leviathan raids a couple weeks ago so they could experience them.",Arixama,1
oh I wouldn't mind doing some eater/spire runs soon,RonInDune,1
i enjoy EoW a lot but i don't want to give up my 69 clears LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
"I need to eventually run a prestige for the catalyst for that shotgun, and do EoW/SoS once armor 2.0 is out",Crizum,1
"Nice! I’m excited. I’ll prolly baby it with using controller still - my only recent kbm experience in the past 5 yrs has been csgo and that went poorly - and stick to pvp on console to start, but over time I may may the full jump. I started games way back in the day with doom and quake, so the roots are there just lost. My first real experience was ratchet and clank ps2.  But I digress...",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"i've been staying on controller honestly. been getting more used to kb+m when i'm just doing public events and strikes, but controller will definitely just feel way more natural for a while haha.",thegoaliebear,1
Seems about right. I cant wait for those load times tho. Or lack thereof,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
😲,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
and those crispy frame rates.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeeeeeeees pls,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
It really does when you first make the swap. I ran a controller for like 3 months on pc until whisper came out.,Arixama,1
I still use a controller to drive tanks because that controls for tanks on key board are AWFUL,Arixama,1
yeah it,thegoaliebear,1
rip*,thegoaliebear,1
Gotcha. Aight ill stop spamming and get some sleep. Gl with the raids over the weekend,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

"Now I know some people here aren't a fan of the epic game launcher, but they are handing out 6 batman games right now for free. The arkham trilogy and the 3 Lego batman games",Arixama,1
@thegoaliebear time to aim for 420 clears then,RonInDune,1
i'm a fan of that idea.,thegoaliebear,1
@Arixama I have so many games from Epic for free now that it'll soon approach my steam library size,RonInDune,1
Though the only games I actually play are Journey and Control,RonInDune,1
What’s Epic?,Thawxtem,1
The Epic Games Launcher,RonInDune,1
(https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/),RonInDune,1
Is it somehow linked to Steam?,Thawxtem,1
It’s steams competition,Crizum,1
"Lots of people are unhappy with how they are competing, which boils down to paying people to keep games off steam while offering the lowest amount of features they possibly can",Crizum,1
It's like steam at an early stage of evolution,RonInDune,1
"Wow, just heard of Epic and I already don’t want to use it",Thawxtem,1
Think Magikarp to Gyarados,RonInDune,1
They have some good exclusives though,RonInDune,1
Control is the best game I've played in many years,RonInDune,1
It's a better deal for game devs because they get more percentage of the sales,Arixama,1
Yeah that's the only reason i support them,RonInDune,1

thats the dream right there tho,Chance,1
16 win streak,Chance,1
i was at like 1000 when i started it.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm around 1300 right now after a whole season of grinding,RonInDune,1
16 streak will net you Fabled.,Oathbreaker,1
i haven't touched any form of pvp since i got it lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
The worst part about getting fabled is the minute you do your opponents go from seal team 6 to a bunch of potatoes,Crizum,1
and you'll run into a bunch of recluses and other cancer in comp,Chance,1
yeah it's annoying to run into recluse/mountaintop combos way before reaching fabled,RonInDune,1
atleast the number of not forgotten/lunas have dropped off completely,RonInDune,1
but the number of spare rations have skyrocketed,Chance,1
"Because they applied a console nerf to pc haha, and now that it’s not Luna’s it’s SR, and if that gets nerfed it’s Bygones",Crizum,1

I'm waiting for Graviton Lance to become stupidly op again,RonInDune,1
Just ban shotgun apes,Crizum,1
Also they should try to find some way to make sidearms viable,RonInDune,1
Increase range by about 3m before dropoff begins,Oathbreaker,1
"Within intended ranges, Sidearms aren't bad.",Oathbreaker,1
"Did a 1v1 against someone. No HUD, the Gambit Prime Sidearm, and an Aachen sniper. Pulled a We Ran. If I got a bodyshot, I'd push hard and spam Lonesome for the cleanup.",Oathbreaker,1
"They felt okay, not great. If they increase the range by about 3m it'll do it.",Oathbreaker,1
Crizum said erentil and i immediately thought of @Oathbreaker loool,Trissin,1
Why's that lol,Oathbreaker,1
Cuz your roll is nasty,Trissin,1
Different roll but yeah,Oathbreaker,1

"i'm sort of filling in for my supervisor at work right now and if they like me they'll promote me (assuming the position is open, it's complicated and i don't have all the information). because of that, my schedule's a little wonky. basically i'll only be able to play on thursdays fridays and sundays until further notice. sorry, can't fill for scourge tomorrow night",Pentan,1
how do i know if shattered throne is up this week,Chance,1
need it for izanagi,Chance,1
"It's up every 3 weeks, specifically whenever Petra is in Rheasilvia",RonInDune,1
Me and Thawxterm ran it today,RonInDune,1
yeah i know its every 3 weeks just wasn't how to tell because I havent been keeping track,Chance,1
thanks,Chance,1
do we have a 6th for tonight?,thegoaliebear,1
bc if we don't have one for sure I'm not gonna get on. i have a game tomorrow so can't stay up waiting around for someone.,thegoaliebear,1
I got work and a boatload of differential calculus alongside quality assurance work. No can do for me.,Oathbreaker,1
yeah lol i have a ton of work to get done for next week so. it's cool tho. we have the checkpoints until tuesday reset.,thegoaliebear,1
Is it just 3x insurrection? I don't mind helping out,Trissin,1
Yeah no worries we'll get it whenever people are free,RonInDune,1
"that should be like, what, half an hour?",Trissin,1
maybe a bit longer,Trissin,1
It's actually 2x,RonInDune,1
only 2 yeah aha.,thegoaliebear,1
We finished one,RonInDune,1
"oh, nicee",Trissin,1
if we have 6 for sure then i don't mind hopping on.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm actually at home tonight lol so I'll be able to help out if ya need me,Trissin,1
Oh then I'll be on within 30 mins,RonInDune,1
Let's get this bread!,RonInDune,1
yeah looks like it haha. i can be on around 9. the earlier we start the better.,thegoaliebear,1
I’m just doing strikes for wendigo so I’m good to go whenever,Crizum,1
I can be on whenever,Trissin,1
"If it's cool with thawx and mugestu, we might be able to start half an hour early it seems",Trissin,1
@Thawxtem @LW Mugetsu ^ you guys available to start around 9?,thegoaliebear,1
My internet is still down. Tree limb took out the line.,LW Mugetsu,1
oof. do you think you'll be on tonight at all?,thegoaliebear,1
Not likely,LW Mugetsu,1
"i mean, we could still 5 man it if necessary, but always better with everyone.",thegoaliebear,1
😦,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'm not happy about it. Can't get anyone out until Monday afternoon.,LW Mugetsu,1
that's rough as hell. but hope it gets fixed then.,thegoaliebear,1
we can still 5 man it.,thegoaliebear,1
I can join as 6th if you still need one,CrizMobius,1
that would be great.,thegoaliebear,1
9 pm thats in 15 min right?,CrizMobius,1
"Sorry, I was eating. I can do 9. (I think it’s a different time zone, so I’ll ask: that’s about 15 minutes, yes?)",Thawxtem,1
yep,Trissin,1
to both lol,Trissin,1
"i'm curious, what FOV do you guys play at?",thegoaliebear,1
110 I think,RonInDune,1
okay. i've worked up to 105...think that's where i'll stay at aha.,thegoaliebear,1
It can go higher than 105??,Trissin,1
105 is max,Oathbreaker,1
wait,Trissin,1
"are armor mods also going to become ""unlocked""? or just weapon mods",Trissin,1
"basically, should I be dismantling my armor mods",Trissin,1
I think armour mods won't be useful for armour 2.0,RonInDune,1
idk i've just been holding onto all my mods until i see exactly how it works lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I think you should dismantle weapon mods,Trissin,1
for free mod components,Trissin,1
"All I'll dismantle are the weapon mods, rest can wait",RonInDune,1
I think keep 1 of each or something,Thawxtem,1
"Save one of each weapon mod, don’t need to save armor I think",Crizum,1
^^,RonInDune,1
ah I see,Trissin,1
so I can go ahead and dismantle armor mods then,Trissin,1
Here is the list of all the weapon mods in the game if you think your missing something,Teddy,1
Anyone looking to run crown of sorrows?,Spitfire2266,1

all good,Spitfire2266,1
"if you want, we have an lfg post maker that you can use to set up a raid for any time you're available. we usually use it to organize stuff in advance.",thegoaliebear,1
cool ill check that out,Spitfire2266,1
the command for it is `!lfg create`,thegoaliebear,1
is anyone in here on the lock and key part of the izanagi quest,Chance,1

my 5 page essay when i wanna play destiny,thegoaliebear,1
"Hey guys, I wanted to post this instead of being silent with this whole thing:

Got an invite to a clan that a number of my buddies are in, and after some deliberation I've decided to join. That being said, I fully intend on staying in the server and if you guys need a body and I'm available I can jump in. Made a hell of a lot of memories with you all in the past year or so, and you've all been great. Like I said, I'm not intending on going anywhere but I wish you all nothing but the best ❤",Oathbreaker,1
"You all are some wonderful people, don't ever forget that.",Oathbreaker,1
@Destiny [PC] who would like to do a Crown run or Scourge anarchy farm on tuesday night? usual 9-9:30 EST start time.,thegoaliebear,1
I’d be down,Crizum,1
What's that 7 Central?,the_drake1997,1
8.,thegoaliebear,1
"i'm only good for sunday, thursday and friday nights now",Pentan,1
i could do thursday night too.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
I might be in class. But if I'm not I'm definitely down! Put me as a maybe,the_drake1997,1
"cool. i'll make an lfg post for it. you can add yourself as an alt if you're not sure, but i'll make it for 9:30 EST.",thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
"wait, which raid do you guys prefer LOL.",thegoaliebear,1
I'm definitely down!,ruGGed_koala,1
"Oh man, if I say crown does it just look like I got anarchy and dipped on scourge?",Crizum,1
"hahaha nah i don't care which one. if it's crown i'll only have time for the one run, but obvs if people wanna do scourge we'd grab the boss phase 2 check points.",thegoaliebear,1
I'd probably be down for a raid gotta double check when some assignments are due,Spitfire2266,1
"sweet. well, i'll make it for Crown, but if people end up wanting to do Scourge when the time comes i'm cool with that too.",thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
if im a maybe do i hit the question mark?,Spitfire2266,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
if ya'll dont mind giving me the low down on encounter i'd like to join been through once b4,ruGGed_koala,1
for sure.,thegoaliebear,1
"As soon as I know my line is fix and my connection is up and running I'd be down, but I won't know that until tomorrow afternoon.",LW Mugetsu,1
Can't jump in as an alt... Something about platform conflict,the_drake1997,1
hmm...weird.,thegoaliebear,1
"Ok fam. What's the play since I now have a pc (yay!) and have enabled cross save? I heard about releasing something for free in the past week or so, but what content do I need to buy on pc? Also, should I just wait for shadowkeep to get a better deal? For instance, if I have all but played out all the content of forsaken and expansions on ps4, then should I just wait til shadowkeep launch to get d2 on steam and roll out then? Will I still need to purchase old content if I want to seamlessly do activities from forsaken?",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
you will still need to purchase forsaken on pc if you want to do stuff from it on pc.,thegoaliebear,1
the annual pass of forsaken was given for free last week. but you will have to wait until oct 1 when the steam migration happens to buy it now because everything was taken off the blizzard store.,thegoaliebear,1
"season pass licenses transfer now tho. you would still have to buy base shadowkeep on both platforms you want to play it on, but you would only need to get seasons on your active character account to transfer the license.",thegoaliebear,1
"so i would just wait until Oct 1. vanilla + y1 will be free to play, you won't have to spend too much of forsaken+AP, and then you can just get base shadowkeep on pc. we have to redownload the game anyway bc of the steam migration so you can wait to see where you want to store the game too.",thegoaliebear,1
Thank you!,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
@Destiny [PC] i'll be on tonight doing regular menagerie runs. just chilling. if anyone would like to join lmk.,thegoaliebear,1
"so apparently SKyburner's Oath has infinite range: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ky4WUuKFTw0",RonInDune,1
oh I saw that video earlier today,Trissin,1
it made me regret doing the catalyst,Trissin,1
That's going to be my secret recipe to get to Fabled,RonInDune,1
don't use Skyburners,Oathbreaker,1
TTK is awful,Oathbreaker,1
better to use even a No Feelings with Box Breathing,Oathbreaker,1
There's a misunderstanding here,Trissin,1
"The opponents will see Ron having equipped a skyburner's oath, and think to themselves ""oh man, he's putting a handicap on himself, there's no way we can match against him!"" and then leave the game",Trissin,1
Exactly,RonInDune,1
It's a psychological trick,RonInDune,1
which raid would you guys prefer tonight?,thegoaliebear,1
also Shadowkeep official launch trailer in one minute.,thegoaliebear,1
:o,Trissin,1
One week left!,Trissin,1
hell yeah!,thegoaliebear,1
"So I should be home by that time tonight,and I've definitely been missing destiny",Arixama,1
looks like pretty good stuff. looking forward to raid and endgame most tho like usual.,thegoaliebear,1
@Arixama and we have missed you😩,thegoaliebear,1
"Fun fact, rural Nebraska has like no data coverage for me",Arixama,1
you love to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
"I 100 percent was going to hop in on that 3 x scourge the other night, but I ended up getting home like 20 minutes after you guys stopped.",Arixama,1
you were with us in spirit,RonInDune,1
that's why two people got anarchy,RonInDune,1
"I think since we have 2 people who aren't as familiar with the raids, scourge might be a bit easier to do and can also do anarchy farm again.",thegoaliebear,1
I smashed my face against Iron banner last night and it was fucking awful. Definitely would be down to do either one,Arixama,1
Still love that we got two anarchy drops and they went to Criz and Crizum,Crizum,1
Gotta start doubling up on other names for drops,Crizum,1
love that for you.,thegoaliebear,1
"It'll be great once we hit steam and can change our names at will. Full raid team of ""Anarchy plz bungo""",Arixama,1
"i feel exposed without ""the"" in front of my tag on blizzard lol.",thegoaliebear,1
steam brings me back to greatness.,thegoaliebear,1
So people are saying this looks like trials armour?,RonInDune,1
Those are 100 percent the gloves,Arixama,1
I will need a trials carry plz,Crizum,1
^^,RonInDune,1
looks like it. i really like the hunter set so would be nice if i could use that again.,thegoaliebear,1
use my flawless ornaments on it😩😩😩,thegoaliebear,1
the hunter boots make my guardian thicc as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
As a Titan you gotta try real hard to not be dummy thicc,Crizum,1
"Less so now, but year 1 was bad",Crizum,1
I want to titan cosplay Big hero 6 again,RonInDune,1
I expect they'll bring back the trails armor in a different activity honestly,Arixama,1
Time for spire,RonInDune,1
Maybe part of menagerie?,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune slap a white shader on that chonky boi.,thegoaliebear,1
Glowhoo better come back,Crizum,1
Not menagerie for sure. Hopefully we'll get more nine story,Arixama,1
Just a disgusting neon chonk running at you full speed,Crizum,1
if they bring back trials armor maybe tie it to a glory rank or something.,thegoaliebear,1
I'd say that's probably likely. Since *in theory* they're making glory easier with the 3v3 and solo queues,Arixama,1
"""pinnacle crucible gear"" honestly it's not a bad idea.",thegoaliebear,1
should make a pinnacle vanguard set too. that would be neat.,thegoaliebear,1
It’s a terrible idea unless you work for a boosting service lol,Crizum,1
I think the changes will help a bit.,thegoaliebear,1
The worst part of crucible is how garbage it is before 2100 and how sweaty quickplay is,Crizum,1
3v3 is more like d1 trials anyway.,thegoaliebear,1
After 2100 was the best games I played this season cause people weren’t getting streamer boosted,Crizum,1
"Honestly, pinnacle armor is a fantastic idea since it will mostly be cosmetic anyway",Arixama,1
That chest is defo the trials warlock set,Teddy,1
^^ to both haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"I suppose, I wouldn’t be against something like armor for valor and glows for glory kind of a thing",Crizum,1
"Pinnacle ornaments would be perfect, actually",Arixama,1
a pinnacle armor set for each would be great. tie it to the pinnacle weapon quest. even more reward for efforts.,thegoaliebear,1
Just watch them tie an OP mod to legend glory,Crizum,1
🙄 I wouldn't doubt it lmao,thegoaliebear,1
“Auto reload your grenade launcher on grenade kills”,Crizum,1
GG mountaintop one eyed,Crizum,1
Grenade launcher kills*,Crizum,1
nah next they'll have like the jade rabbit catalyst at legend,RonInDune,1
"They won't. If they were going to do that, they would have already since the mida catalyst is there.",Arixama,1
Jade rabbit is already in I thought?,Crizum,1
"but the thing is that the pvp population falls to shit again once people are done getting the pinnacle stuff. and if you barely play pvp anyway, it really doesn't affect you.",thegoaliebear,1
Yeah it is I have it what am I asking lol,Crizum,1
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1176542109916004352?s=09,Arixama,1
Sounds like they gotta make the game fun,Crizum,1
If people are playing PvP just to get the best weapons and immediately drop out of PvP they gotta do something to make it worth playing aside from “make the weapon grind longer”,Crizum,1
I know some people don’t want to get sweaty in quickplay so they keep skill based matching out of it but that’s only fun for people who stomp,Crizum,1
So the bottom tier drops out and doesn’t care to get better because why bother,Crizum,1
So people who don't enjoy pvp are playing pvp for their weapons to use in pve since they're good weapons,Arixama,1
exactly. and that will always be the issue. pvp is incredibly unforgiving especially to newer players who never have the chance or time to get those pinnacle weapons. because the only people who stay in QP are the sweats who feel like they're special stomping on others with all their pinnacle pvp weapons lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I think Recluse and Revoker were fine in their quest design tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"They were, MT was terrible because it reinforced bad habits",Crizum,1
but again...i haven't touched pvp for months after i got recluse. so the longevity factor isn't there at all really.,thegoaliebear,1
Just saying for me the least sweaty matches shouldn’t be locked between fabled and mythic glory lol,Crizum,1
but i agree with MT being awful. i just never bothered with it bc i 1. hate pvp and 2. couldn't willingly play awful just to get a gun I know I'd barely use.,thegoaliebear,1
Revoker was probably the best because you could just gain and lose glory and eventually you’d get the number you needed,Crizum,1
yeah. 3500 is a solid amount but with no loss penalty it didn't feel as discouraging.,thegoaliebear,1
Problem is mt is amazing damage in the current sandbox 😦,Crizum,1
"The only reason I'm even getting it I cause I jokingly asked my buddy if he'd get it for me and he was like ""get me these specific perks and I will""",Arixama,1
"GLs are great in general. and with all the weapon buffs and changes coming, i think a wide variety of loadouts are going to be seen.",thegoaliebear,1
I like being able to roll with different stuff that can aid a bunch of play styles. so I'm excited for the changes.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah towards the end of the wendigo quest I really started to enjoy fighting lion,RonInDune,1
"it's a complete different method of fighting, but even more interesting",RonInDune,1
i happen to love the black armory auto rifle. so with the buffs coming in going to try farming out a good roll on it.,thegoaliebear,1
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1176542833613783041,thegoaliebear,1
blessed.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm excited to be able to look the way I want, and be able to change perks on the fly. Plus, the infinite power level up will be great because it'll make it easier to help inexperienced raiders complete encounters easier",Arixama,1
Get preloading PC bros,Teddy,1
PRELOAD,Oathbreaker,1
we love that for us.,thegoaliebear,1
PREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELOAD,Oathbreaker,1
ALRIGHT LETS DOUBLE OUR DESTINY DISK SPACE BOIS,Arixama,1
WORTH IT,Oathbreaker,1
ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT,Oathbreaker,1
i think I'm gonna move it to my SSD. get some of my now less played games onto my HDD instead.,thegoaliebear,1
So like we at 300 gigs?,Crizum,1
It’s 80GB apparently,Teddy,1
the entire game?,thegoaliebear,1
not bad at all. SSD it is for me then.,thegoaliebear,1
It’s gonna need double that to unpack tho,Teddy,1
yeah i have plenty of space. this is the only game i keep on my SSD.,thegoaliebear,1
I wish I could add one more SSD to my laptop,RonInDune,1
i still have like 490GB free on my ssd haha. not an issue.,thegoaliebear,1
bloody hell lol,RonInDune,1
this laptop came with a 256 gig SSD and that's all I'm stuck with,RonInDune,1
i just went with a 512GB SSD for D2 and OS. plenty of space and then a 2TB HDD for other games and files.,thegoaliebear,1
Thinking I want to put another ssd in my system but I didn’t build it so I don’t want to screw anything up haha,Crizum,1
Technically I think you could make an image and clone it on to a new bigger ssd @RonInDune,Arixama,1
"Yeah I might en dup doing that eventually, I just don't like messing around with the primary drive",RonInDune,1
Or once I've settled down I'll build a proper desktop,RonInDune,1
Anybody not have shadowkeep preordered on pc try downloading it?,Arixama,1
Did they release the Mars community challenge emblem yet?,RonInDune,1
nope. no word on it either lol.,thegoaliebear,1
hmmmmm,RonInDune,1
@Arixama,RonInDune,1
Awesome,Arixama,1
I think I get my code on Saturday?,Arixama,1
Nice! Does the deluxe edition come with a disc?,RonInDune,1
Not on pc for sure.,Arixama,1
Also since we're talking about steam stuff,Arixama,1
https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arixama1187,Arixama,1
My steam is filled with troll games my friends bought me haha,Crizum,1
i just have base shadowkeep preordered on steam so when i go to preload will it still do the whole game along with the Shadowkeep?,thegoaliebear,1
"Yes, because of newlight",Arixama,1
I think the way Destiny works is you download everything but they just gate you out of what you don’t have,Crizum,1
Yup.,Arixama,1
cool.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah according to Bungie this is everything,RonInDune,1
For fun if you have any of the PS4 exclusive stuff log on and equip it and switch to pc,Crizum,1
i wish steam migration was today haha,thegoaliebear,1
"Same, but I'm also glad its not for various reasons as well",Arixama,1
"I like the new steam library, looks so much more modern",RonInDune,1
I do wish they had dropped the new armor system today though. Like they did with the weapon system last year,Arixama,1
tru tru,RonInDune,1
"It's Mayhem this week, in case anyone still needs to grind mountaintop",RonInDune,1
Plus Valor and infamy boosts,Arixama,1
I'm gonna get Fabled this week even if it kills me,RonInDune,1
What are you at now?,Crizum,1
Like 1500 or so,RonInDune,1
i can't wait to get rid of the blizzard launcher next week.,thegoaliebear,1
im not going to do crown tonight so im going to take myself off,MrTster,1
Trials armor in the trailer confirmed a mistake,Arixama,1
oh no,RonInDune,1
love that.,thegoaliebear,1
At least they're not keeping silent about it.,Arixama,1
Seems like we're definitely off to a good start as far as communication goes,Arixama,1
"well the last of us trailer looked good, if a bit violent",RonInDune,1
watching the destiny trailer and then tLoU makes me appreciate the artstyle even more,RonInDune,1
Last of us is definitely a violent game 😂😂,Arixama,1
Yeah it's more Mortal Kombat than Uncharted that's for sure,RonInDune,1
"i love the story in TLOU. i don't see myself buying it lol, but i'll definitely watch streams of it. love Ellie so much.",thegoaliebear,1
Ellie does look like she's sure seen some shit,RonInDune,1
I mean,Arixama,1
She for sure has,Arixama,1
I thought TLoU would be a PS5 launch title,RonInDune,1
I don't know if you've seen the first game,Arixama,1
Enhanced edition will be,Crizum,1
I hve seen bits and pieces of playthroughs,RonInDune,1
Loved the giraffe scene,RonInDune,1
yeah that girl is hella traumatized.,thegoaliebear,1
"I still need to actually play through the dlc. Seen it played, just didn't ay through it.",Arixama,1
"Hey everyone - Not sure if this is where I should post something like this, but I was wondering if anyone was looking for a couple of players to do the new raid on Oct 5th when it comes out. Me and Spitfire2266 are looking for a first day raid group. Let me know if anyone would like us in their group. Me and spitfire are quite new to this clan.",HShmoob,1
yes we will get a group together.,thegoaliebear,1
i can't get on until at least 8pm EST that night since i have a game. so we'll likely shoot for that time to start learning it.,thegoaliebear,1
I’d for sure be down assuming I can reach a decent light level,Crizum,1
decent enough to do the first encounter is always my goal hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
i should have the 4-6 off if all goes to plan!,ruGGed_koala,1
"i dont know for sure what my work schedule will be, but ill probably be on around  then too",Arixama,1
but the good thing about getting a group for a day one learning is we can continue to learn together until we complete it. so knowing you have people to do it with is always nice.,thegoaliebear,1
but i will make an lfg post for it maybe next tuesday so people can see what their schedule might look like better then.,thegoaliebear,1
It’s a Saturday correct?,Crizum,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
"Cool, off saturdays for the time being",Crizum,1
"i am glad because we have Sundays off, so i can stay up as late as people want to go haha.",thegoaliebear,1
"but it looks like we might have enough interest to even get two groups going, which is awesome.",thegoaliebear,1
sounds great!,HShmoob,1
I should have that entire weekend avaiable as well,HShmoob,1
available*,HShmoob,1
gonna be hard to keep away from twitch always used to watching the worlds first race but wanna get into the raid completely blind,Spitfire2266,1
"i always watch streams, but given that my game takes up my entire day i will likely be going into this mostly blind.",thegoaliebear,1
i usually like figuring stuff out first time into it and then when worlds first clear happens I'll look through a guide once they post what they did lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I found out quick watching some of the better streamers solve the raid is way more interesting than me banging my head into it,RonInDune,1
"yeah. i think i have like a one hour tolerance of going in blind before I'm like ""fuck it what did they do"" lol.",thegoaliebear,1
i wish i had the time to actually figure out a raid totally blind but...having time. imagine. LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
Ok so,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
What do? No forsaken memes.,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
The Forsaken stuff will be added at a later date,Crizum,1
did you already get the deluxe on ps4?,Arixama,1
forsaken?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i have not purchased shadowkeep anywhere yet,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
are you planning on sticking on ps4?,Arixama,1
im gonna do both,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"your primary account is ps4 based, yeah?",Arixama,1
"Only need deluxe on one, buy it on whatever your main account is",Crizum,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
ok so you're saying buy the $60 on ps4.....then free to play on pc? or still need to pay 35 on pc additionally?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
still pay 35 on pc,Arixama,1
ahhh. that's whack,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"You will still need to buy Shadowkeep, and eventually Forsaken if you want to play any of that stuff, on pc",Crizum,1
you still need base SK on PC. but the season pass will transfer from deluxe version on PS4.,thegoaliebear,1
"season passes will transfer, shadowkeep stuff wont",Arixama,1
i c,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
ty,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
will we have a 6th for tonight? I'm feeling pretty tired so i think i would be cool doing scourge and grabbing checkpoints.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'm down for some scourge checkpoints,RonInDune,1
awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
same,Arixama,1
When are we starting it again?,RonInDune,1
9:30ish. so in about 45 mins if that's good.,thegoaliebear,1
Good for me. Running comp on Ps4 so I may be slightly late depending on match timing,Arixama,1
that is perfect,RonInDune,1
So suddenly I *may* not be able to raid,Arixama,1
😦,thegoaliebear,1
Big storm just hit and my friends a cross town lost lower,Arixama,1
Power,Arixama,1
hope your power stays up haha.,thegoaliebear,1
https://www.shacknews.com/article/113196/how-to-fix-update-stuck-on-initializing-in-destiny-2,RonInDune,1
"Earlier you guys asked about which platform I plan to be my main.....if I buy the digital deluxe on ps4 and play on pc, I'm still earning everything for the season at the same rate right?",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Yeah,Crizum,1
"yup its the same characters, they just become playable on other platforms with cross save",Arixama,1
"ok, so technically that doesn't matter which system i buy the deluxe so long as the other I just get normal. Idk why I'm being so thorough about this here, but I'm that kinda person i guess",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
that's what I thought @Arixama,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
So the reason for buying the deluxe on main was a tweet that basically said any seasons you bought will transfer as long as you bought them on whatever your “home” platform is,Crizum,1
you need to buy the deluxe on whatever your active character's account is.,thegoaliebear,1
"so if you want to play everything on both platforms from now on, and your active characters you have activated for cross save are on PS4, then you need to buy any season passes on the PS4.",thegoaliebear,1
ohhhh but wait why would i rebuy forsaken then? im confused,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
because you still need the base licenses for that expansion on PC.,thegoaliebear,1
"Think of it this way, seasons will be be fluid and work wherever, September releases (Forsaken, Shadowkeep) require separate purchases to license",Crizum,1
"^ yup. so, the base expansions are separate add ons to the game, but the seasons are just updates essentially.",thegoaliebear,1
❤,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"ok, so i was just reading through this...trying to figure it out...so i brought my characters from PS4 and bought the deluxe on steam. so does that mean in playstation i will have nothing?",the_drake1997,1
"You won’t have Shadowkeep on PS4 if you don’t buy it, you may have access to seasons",Crizum,1
and if i bought the deluxe on PS4 then i would have it here too,the_drake1997,1
"sorry, i know yall just went over this with Obsolete, just clarifying for my behalf",the_drake1997,1
"Bungie's communication skills could be better in this subject, especially given they recently introduced crossplay",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
"Hey, is there a reason that there is hardly anyone on my clan list in destiny? i only see two people...",the_drake1997,1
It's late at night,thikthird,1
it's late and also are you still in the ps4 clan and were you playing on PC at that time? @the_drake1997,thegoaliebear,1
"because if you are, even if you're playing on PC your active clan is still linked to whichever clan you're in for that set of characters. so if you're in the PS4 clan and you're playing on PC, you will only see people from the PS4 clan who have recently played on PC as well.",thegoaliebear,1

This is the best one: https://twitter.com/shackleshotgun/status/1176931772199841792,RonInDune,1
that is sick.,thegoaliebear,1
what cloak is that?,Arixama,1
i like my build,thegoaliebear,1
the amethyst veil shader makes it look even better bc now it's all black.,thegoaliebear,1
"Season 5 iron banner cloak, according to the comments",RonInDune,1
"Oooh  goal that is pretty fly, looks like Ghost from the 2nd Ant-Man movie",RonInDune,1
that is actually the kind of look I was going for!,thegoaliebear,1
the black and grey shaders go best especially bc the purple jewels on the chest are fixed color.,thegoaliebear,1
but I'm glad the gold from the scourge gloves and lw helmet matches LOL. nothing worse than off shades of gold.,thegoaliebear,1
The Wings of Sacred Dawn ornament (midnight sun) kinda does that black/white theme pretty well too,RonInDune,1
idk if you saw in that thread but there was a Michelin man chonky boi hahaha,thegoaliebear,1
the all white eater set.,thegoaliebear,1
oh my god,Arixama,1
it's hilarious.,thegoaliebear,1
It looks amazing,RonInDune,1
watch out for that look on the next New York Fashion Week,RonInDune,1
"This'll be my next set, just gotta find a better helmet:",RonInDune,1
I like that.,thegoaliebear,1
this is mine from year one,Teddy,1
oh that's dope,RonInDune,1
this was my warlock in CoO. mars set + sunbracers + golden trace shader.,thegoaliebear,1
the mars chest from warmind is SO GOOD,Arixama,1
i definitely plan on going back to the mars set for my warlock once armor 2.0 is out. it really is a great set.,thegoaliebear,1
put metro shift on that shit and its gorgeous,Arixama,1
y1 titan:,thegoaliebear,1
oh heck it's thor,RonInDune,1
ok how the fuck did you get those screenshots,Arixama,1
I can't wait for armor 2.0 so I can get these builds back LOL,thegoaliebear,1
theyre fantastic,Arixama,1
it was when you could replay the missions in the edz or something.,thegoaliebear,1
OH so its the solar subclass mission?,Arixama,1
OH when you unlocked the subclass yeah. that mission.,thegoaliebear,1
wish we could replay those missions,RonInDune,1
"its real easy, just delete a character and start again /s",Arixama,1
I'm defo getting this hunter armour back when SK is out,Teddy,1
"I just realized, levelling up secondary characters will be bit of a slog won't it",RonInDune,1
I always replayed missions with cut scenes. especially in d1. these are some of my favorite shots of my hunter:,thegoaliebear,1
that cloak was great! Do we have anything similar now?,RonInDune,1
nope hahaha :'),thegoaliebear,1
😿,RonInDune,1
the glow on the garden of salvation cloak is about as close as we'll come.,thegoaliebear,1
ornamemted Kings Fall set tho😍😍😍,thegoaliebear,1
oh man that looks spooooky,RonInDune,1
i want the taken armor sets back.,Arixama,1
YEAH,thegoaliebear,1
I wish we could run the tincture look everywhere,RonInDune,1
some of the armor sets in year 1 were really nice so I'm happy to bring them back.,thegoaliebear,1
there was straight up a taken set in d1 that was like that ron,Arixama,1
It's all Ghaul's fault we lost all those awesome armour,RonInDune,1
*zavala voice* indeed.,thegoaliebear,1

If only D2 had D1 armor. #bringD3,Matos,1
@Arixama,Matos,1
it aint happening man 😂,Arixama,1
I just want my Hive/Taken weapons and armor,Matos,1
my precious,Matos,1
if we don't end up having enough for raid tonight i'll just be doing forges.,thegoaliebear,1
zen moment/tap the trigger/and hcr on ringing nail. not bad. probs gonna farm out some rolls on it.,thegoaliebear,1
That's a good roll! I wish it could have zen moment/dynamic sway reduction but tap the trigger or high impact reserves both feel good,RonInDune,1
yeah. i am going to do a couple more frames for it now i think. i like the auto so if i get a good roll i'm going to keep it for SK.,thegoaliebear,1
"its curated roll is okay, but dragonfly is a wasted perk on an auto imo",RonInDune,1
tap the trigger feels weird on pc to me,Arixama,1
I like it on sidearms/smgs,RonInDune,1
i'm pretty happy with the roll i got. but yeah i'd prefer something other than tap the trigger haha. i like zen moment tho definitely a great perk for autos.,thegoaliebear,1
after using something with it on console where its easier to actually tap the trigger it just feels a bit weird,Arixama,1
yeah i mean it's also weird bc with autos i want to spray around and kill stuff so likely not going to be tapping the trigger on it aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Just looked at my release week schedule, got the 2nd and 4th-6th off :tfuC:",ruGGed_koala,1

look at this hot garbage,Arixama,1

You'll be a global hawk drone raining death from above,RonInDune,1
i might just do some more auto rifle farming tomorrow night. i really like my zen moment and hcr but...feel like i can do even better.,thegoaliebear,1
maybe sunday night we can shoot to finish those checkpoints tho. i have games fri/sat so will be unavailable until then.,thegoaliebear,1
high impact reserves is good with autos,RonInDune,1
yeah I'm down to finish those whenever we have a group,RonInDune,1
cool.,thegoaliebear,1
Good luck with your games! Score many goals!,RonInDune,1
"yeah, im usually good anytime after 7",Arixama,1
sounds good.,thegoaliebear,1
"Uh oh, people are getting errors when logging in with “This version of Destiny 2 is no longer available please see Bungie.net for details”",Crizum,1
Imagine if they shadow dropped Shadowkeep,Crizum,1
The pre launch period for such a big release must be absolutely nervewracking for Bungie sheesh,RonInDune,1
"I would get shakes before updating a crappy mobile app, can't imagine the pressure for something like this",RonInDune,1
"Oh no doubt they have to be in panic mode, expansion and launcher move AND new version launch at the same time? That’s insane",Crizum,1
"yeah they have so much going on rn. and especially now that they're independent from activision. i wasn't expecting everything to be smooth. but I'm glad something like that happened now instead of, ya know, next tuesday LOL.",thegoaliebear,1
"but also...

I'm ashamed to say I'll probably have multiple of those triumphs,RonInDune,1
hahaha. I'm thankful i don't have any.,thegoaliebear,1
wait i'm seeing some people say that if you have the disc for D2 on console you will need to download the entire game and delete the old version for it ?? i'm confused where they're getting that from since SK is just a normal expansion.,thegoaliebear,1
"only logic i can maybe see is that fact that its new light, but that still doesnt actually make sense",Arixama,1
yeah because it's not like it's a new game. New Light will be added to the ps store as a free download game.,thegoaliebear,1
it's like...you own the game already lol.,thegoaliebear,1
and your ps4 is going to download whatever it needs to do automatically anyway.,thegoaliebear,1
"There’s some issue now where it’s saying you don’t have the right version I guess, even if you have the digital version",Crizum,1
"Probably because of the work they are doing, something went live early",Crizum,1
"Blizzard people are getting issues too, plus whatever the hell happened to you Tuesday",Crizum,1
"yeah, probably getting people all nervous haha. like redownloading on PC makes total sense because we're moving to an entirely different launcher/library. but having to redownload on console wouldn't make sense.",thegoaliebear,1
but glad to know i'm not the only one who experienced whatever the hell that was HAHA.,thegoaliebear,1
Bungie is likely doing some kinda backend work so some things may be getting messed around with,Oathbreaker,1
"Depends on licensing I’d assume, new light being technically a different game",Crizum,1
i mean i'm leaving my ps4 on all day monday anyway...so if that's what its gotta do...then that's what it'll do haha.,thegoaliebear,1
All I know is that copying phase on PS4 is gonna be murder,Crizum,1
big oof.,thegoaliebear,1
It means that my Monday is gonna be crazy productive at school so,Oathbreaker,1
im glad i picked up the digital version off ps+ and downloaded that,Arixama,1
that's why i'm leaving mine on haha.,thegoaliebear,1
maybe they'll clear that up at some point.,thegoaliebear,1

New pinnacle weapons!,Trissin,1
Nope!,Crizum,1
"""Ritual weapons""",RonInDune,1
"sorry, ""ritual""",Trissin,1
Is that a gambit sidearm?,RonInDune,1
They specifically call them out as weaker,Crizum,1
i think it's an smg,Trissin,1
aww,RonInDune,1
I like this emblem,RonInDune,1
Very 60s,RonInDune,1
garden jacket revealed as well,Trissin,1
im so excited,Trissin,1
aaaah,Trissin,1
haven't really played destiny since like the first week of solstice,Trissin,1
I'm so hyped bloody hell,RonInDune,1
So recluse did get a nerf haha,Crizum,1
"Probably not a major one, and sounds like for PvE",Crizum,1
"Yeah but so did everything else, so it'll stay relatively powerful",RonInDune,1
Maybe now bad juju/huckleberry can catch up,RonInDune,1
"I like it, people won’t feel funneled in to crucible just for a weapon",Crizum,1
"huckleberry is good, but I'm not sure it's worth the exotic slot",Trissin,1
And yeah sounds like they want exotics to be actually better than some of the legendaries,Crizum,1
"that reminds me, wavesplitter",Trissin,1
Seems like they are focusing on power creep,Crizum,1
oooh,RonInDune,1
@Arixama can finally equip it now lol,Trissin,1
wavesplitter and anarchy are the only two exotic I don't have,RonInDune,1
There’s an easy solution Ron,Crizum,1
Does this mean the PS4 crucible map is now available for all?,RonInDune,1
Change your name to CrizInDune and you’ll get Anarchy,Crizum,1
^,Trissin,1
^^,RonInDune,1
And yeah no more exclusive content so wait which was the PS4 only map,Crizum,1
not sure,Trissin,1
Retribution?,RonInDune,1
wait no,RonInDune,1
hang on,RonInDune,1
"I know there is Broodhold, and god help you now you get to delete Thorium Holt and Red Moon armor",Crizum,1

"Upset there's no information about garden, like what power the encounters will be, what contest will restrict us too, etc",Trissin,1
I don't think they'll give more details than this:,RonInDune,1
"Also, did Redrix really need a nerf?",RonInDune,1
ohhhh,Trissin,1
i guess I missed that part,Trissin,1
yeah that was from last week,RonInDune,1
890 and 920,Trissin,1
got it,Trissin,1
"with the soft cap being 900, I dont think it's gonna be hard to hit",Trissin,1
Yeah plus we have some time,RonInDune,1
When does the raid launch again?,RonInDune,1
5th,Trissin,1
hardcore min-maxing really isn't that necessary then.,thegoaliebear,1
No I mean what time? After reset?,RonInDune,1
at reset i believe.,thegoaliebear,1
"ooh, i don't know",Trissin,1
probably at reset yeah,Trissin,1
"Trissin or goal if you're going for it, maybe stream?",RonInDune,1
I'll definitely be watching,RonInDune,1
aaah I don't really stream,Trissin,1
TIME TO LEARN,RonInDune,1
I think goal has a game,Trissin,1
i'm not on until at least 8pm that day.,thegoaliebear,1
If it's like Last Wish then raid might not be over by 8 anyway,RonInDune,1
i'm gonna be setting up a day one lfg here maybe on sunday for that saturday night. i know we have people who want to get into it.,thegoaliebear,1
"i would like to think it'll be close to LW caliber, given that it's the major expansion raid rather than a season raid.",thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, I think it's gonna be a really big one",Trissin,1
"so, we will have plenty to learn haha.",thegoaliebear,1
Can't believe the last vex raid was vault,Trissin,1
"I mean ""eater of worlds""",Trissin,1
but,Trissin,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Trissin,1
it was vault lol,Trissin,1
full sized raid lol.,thegoaliebear,1
There might be more console completions this time round due to cross save,RonInDune,1
I saw gladd and datto and co attempt all the D1 raids recently and VoG was pretty cool but some of the encounters were really long,RonInDune,1
Shorter than Crown's opening,Oathbreaker,1
there were really only two major encounters in the raid haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Tru tru,RonInDune,1
"speaking of, @Oathbreaker we should try two man it this weekend",Trissin,1
Crown's opening is unnecessarily long imo,RonInDune,1
I have a tourney on Saturday and Sunday is a maybe,Oathbreaker,1
"ooh, okay",Trissin,1
flawless crown is terrible if you end up having to do that encounter over and over haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I would guess Crown is probably easier to flawless than either of last wish/Scourge?,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I think so.",Trissin,1
for sure.,thegoaliebear,1
Even with the vessel bug my team had no problems with it,Trissin,1
What are the odds we try a heroic menagerie run this weekend?,RonInDune,1
i could do that.,thegoaliebear,1
I might be able to hop on,Trissin,1
that'd be amazing,RonInDune,1
But i'm gonna try to get a lot of next week's work done in advance,Trissin,1
so I can grind shadowkeep haha,Trissin,1
Yeah i understand lol,RonInDune,1
"Actually, I still need a sole survivor with firing line",Trissin,1
It's not available in reckoning this week right?,Trissin,1
It's *the* gun's week,Oathbreaker,1
i won't be doing much until shadowkeep aside from farming these ringing nails haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I don't want to even use it's name after farming for one so much,Oathbreaker,1
So next week Trissin,Oathbreaker,1
okay,Trissin,1
"I played fair amount of reckoning last week, but never got one",Trissin,1
can't even imagine farming for _the_ gun before the improved drop rate,Trissin,1
Please don't remind me,Oathbreaker,1
I’ve got a triple tap firing line waiting for me in the vault,Crizum,1
😮,Trissin,1
Almost sharded it before I knew what it was,Crizum,1
You know the supposed trick for better drop rates?,Crizum,1
"I guess run T3 until you don’t get a drop, next run T2 and you should get one, and hop back to T3. It’s spare rations week right?",Crizum,1
but then you have to leave and re-enter matchmaking a whole bunch,Trissin,1
Yeah only really works if you four stack,Crizum,1
I'd rather stick with a strong team in t2 a bunch of times,Trissin,1
ahhh,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Which I’m sure we could get a group going,Crizum,1
wait,Trissin,1
omg,Trissin,1
there's a sole survivor in my vault,Trissin,1
firing line and field prep,Trissin,1
You're set,Oathbreaker,1
Niiiiice,Crizum,1
when did that get there wtf,Trissin,1
i probably vaulted it after some gambit or something a while ago,Trissin,1
The wording makes me feel like I need to spend the weekend grinding out 21% delirium and hush,Crizum,1
"I think you can still get them, and it won't reset your progress",Trissin,1
Delirium feels amazing to use honestly,RonInDune,1
Lol I still haven't claimed mine,Trissin,1
I hope that they don't get rid of the weapons or quests entirely. I've had Not Forgotten as a goal for nearly a year now. If they take that away from me....,Oathbreaker,1
@Crizum,Trissin,1
Pinnacle weapons will still be obtainable,Trissin,1
Oh good haha,Crizum,1
good.,Oathbreaker,1
"I know it's not much, but goodbye",Trissin,1
Don't forget to use up your eververse bounties,RonInDune,1
"damn, how do u have so many baryon boughs lol",Trissin,1
"actually, a better question would be why",Trissin,1
I used to do the dreaming city stuff on all three characters every week for some reason,RonInDune,1
In case I missed some important bit of lore,RonInDune,1
lool,Trissin,1
i see,Trissin,1
I just chucked anything over 999 so I’m sitting at 750 after buying tinctures,Crizum,1

"Alright, I didn't end up getting the crown jacket, and I really wanna get the garden one.",Arixama,1
It looks sick as fuck,Arixama,1
"I know it's maybe more about the completion, but I could have given you my jacket for crown",Trissin,1
I mean the jacket looked sick 😂,Arixama,1
I probably would've taken it,Arixama,1
I'm definitely going after the jacket this time through.,Nahkriin,1
"Lol if I get the jacket for Garden, let me know if you want it",Trissin,1
"Ok, Thanks!",Nahkriin,1
although you might have to work it out with ari / anyone else wanting the jacket,Trissin,1
"I just hope I have enough time to get to high power quickly, I have a few hard classes this year.",Nahkriin,1
I've got a midterm on Wednesday,Trissin,1
It's gonna be so hard to stop myself from playing too much,Trissin,1
"Yeah, good luck with your midterm!",Nahkriin,1
"Haha ty lol, this weekend is gonna be work and studying",Trissin,1
"I know the feel, I have to work on some scholarship applications and my college essay this week.",Nahkriin,1
ohhh yeah that's gonna be a lot,Trissin,1

so i have to download D2 again through steam?,Matos,1
can i move the files over?,Matos,1
nope,Arixama,1
steam has an encryption process,Arixama,1
"if youre super worried about it, theres 24 hour maintainence on the 30th and you can just do it then",Arixama,1
how do i uninstall current d2?,Matos,1
options -> uninstall,Arixama,1
"Wonder when we even get the jackets. I mean, the season is practically over and they haven’t even been shipped yet",Thawxtem,1
you talking the crown jackets?,Arixama,1
Yah,Thawxtem,1
"so doing a quick google, it looks like people didnt receive their last wish jackets until march or so. i know its not something they have made up due to not knowing the number of people who will be ordering them, so it takes a bit of time to process.",Arixama,1
"alright I sent out a bunch of friend invitations on steam, hopefully didn't hit any wrong profiles",RonInDune,1
got it!,Trissin,1
Perfect!,RonInDune,1
"also cleaned out my friends list, i had 10 people who hadn't logged in in 5 years and I don't remember at all",RonInDune,1
Man so gladd and chevy just 2 manned Gahlran at 720 power,RonInDune,1
The game really needs some dps balancing sheesh,RonInDune,1
"next week on your YouTube feeds: **Gladd and Chevy 2-man Garden at 20 Power, White Gear Only! [Full Raid]**",Trissin,1
insane to think this is the last week anything can happen between 401 and 749 power in destiny,Arixama,1
"yeah, wow. They should bump up the power of Y1 raids and stuff to match",Trissin,1
My poor 10 power travellers chosen will now be crucible meta,RonInDune,1
oh no!! our low power gear that we saved is gonna get bumped up too,Trissin,1
my fancy 10 power ace shall be a thing of the past,Arixama,1
"Welp, I'm heading out this weekend, so I won't be able to play Destiny again until Shadowkeep. How long do you think it will be until people are willing to do the old Leviathan raids now that they include banners, even though there's the new Shadowkeep stuff?",Thawxtem,1
i bought and preloaded shadowkeep deluxe on steam today. deleted the game from blizzard.,Pentan,1
"Actually I think the old raids will be pretty popular for a short time after release @Thawxtem , since a lot of people want armor 2.0",Trissin,1
idk if i'll be playing d2 this weekend so i've kept blizzard lol.,thegoaliebear,1
can't wait to delete it tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"i definitely plan on grabbing the scourge and crown sets on my hunter for 2.0 builds. titan and warlock tho, y1 stuff has some of my favorite gear for those classes aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah I’ll probably be doing the raids for older gear, i like last wish and sorrows stuff",Crizum,1
"I think the prestige levi armor is actually pretty cool, with like the purple glow and stuff",Trissin,1
yeah that is a nice set.,thegoaliebear,1
i might get that back on my titan.,thegoaliebear,1
"Still need the shotgun catalyst, didn’t do much Y1",Crizum,1
lol I need it too,Trissin,1
never got the acrius catalyst somehow,Trissin,1
"Telesto and Sleeper as well, I have t even done normal spire or eater",Crizum,1
ooh.,thegoaliebear,1
"well, we gotta take you through those some time then.",thegoaliebear,1
Spire is fun,Trissin,1
i think my mom is bringing my other monitor today after my game so...won't be capped at 60fps anymore lol bless.,thegoaliebear,1
"So far behind the curve on pc stuff. I’m just upgrading to an ssd today, let alone a better monitor",Crizum,1
ooh nice!,thegoaliebear,1
i had my 60hz one since I was still playing on ps4 then but now I can have my 144hz glory lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"I’ll be solid until Cyberpunk, at which point I’ll spend a whole lot of money I don’t need to",Crizum,1
haha i feel that. I am looking at getting a 2700X and 2070 Super maybe come the end of this school year for me. then i won't need to think about upgrades for a while.,thegoaliebear,1
I think that’s the season pass exotic you get if you buy the annual pass,Crizum,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
That impact and range is disgusting,Crizum,1
i want to see the lore for it now😩,thegoaliebear,1
Do u mind putting a spoiler tag on those?,Trissin,1
@Crizum,Trissin,1
"Sorry, I’ll jus delete cause I don’t know how on mobile aha",Crizum,1
```||like this||```,Arixama,1
"Xûr's selling Helm of Saint-14 with rocket launcher reserves, get it while you can!",RonInDune,1
I guess that's gonna be really helpful for riven after shadowkeep,Trissin,1
and nokris too,Trissin,1
"One more benefit of pc, I can swap the enhanced heavy lifting/heavy ammo finder helm out for the launcher reserves one mid fight",Crizum,1
If that’s even worth doing?,Crizum,1
You think they are doing a round of nerfs so they can bring back the ballerhorn?,Crizum,1
I honestly don't know how worth it it is to pick up since exotics are immediately being upgraded to 2.0,Arixama,1
My uncle got the game a while back. We finished warmind last week. After we do forsaken I'll definitely have to take him through Levi,Nahkriin,1
raids are fun,Trissin,1
"I'm also looking forward to the new dungeon, that should be really interesting",Trissin,1
Going to solo flawless that one too!! If possible,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"It looks like they took the pyramidion, corrupted it with hive and gave it about 20 doses of steroids from the bits they've shown",Arixama,1
lool,Trissin,1

All players who qualified by completing a Nightfall will receive an emblem in their Collection today.

Yay!!,RonInDune,1
"So if Xur's dropping all year 2 exotics next week, can we get wavesplitter immediately?",RonInDune,1
"If it still works the same way, yeah",Arixama,1
Nice,RonInDune,1
So anarchy will remain my only nemesis,RonInDune,1
I think they mentioned somewhere that they're changing fated engrams somehow though?,Arixama,1
I think just updating them to include year 2 stuff I thought,Crizum,1
^^,RonInDune,1
Wonder how many exotics we’ll be getting per class,Crizum,1
Ruin wings pls,Trissin,1
"I remember there being something about changing it to not guarantee exotics  you don't have, but I also could have dreamed that up",Arixama,1
With heavy ammo finder around ruin wings would have to juice up like a roid rager,Crizum,1
Twilight Garrison please,Trissin,1
Hahaha oh god yeah if people are angry about one eyed,Crizum,1
Would love garrison back,Crizum,1
I'm hoping we see dark drinker and the other exotic swords from taken king,Arixama,1
I'd love some sort of Warlock movement exotic (not astrocyte verse) like stompees/lion rampants,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, that'd be pretty great",Trissin,1
"top tree dawn + wings of sacred dawn is the only combo I know that can do what lion rampants do, but it's so much slower",RonInDune,1
The only improvement they could make to warlock jump is making it not continue momentum,Arixama,1
tru tru,RonInDune,1
They should make it like how Jesse flies in control,RonInDune,1
"I gotta disagree there. Having to hold space to ascend is cool, but removes the perk of just being able to double and go, plus the inherent infinite slow fall would break so many things",Arixama,1
Warlock jump should still continue momentum,Trissin,1
Otherwise you can't do the fun stuff with worldline,Trissin,1
is there anyone who would be willing to help me get whisper of the worm,SSimpson,1
"Sure, ofc

But im not home rn",Trissin,1
i just end up running out of time at the second add room,SSimpson,1
its so frustrating,SSimpson,1
Are you soloing?? Getting that far is really really good,Trissin,1
i thought it was a solo thing,SSimpson,1
lol,SSimpson,1
Nah it's built for a fireteam of 3,Arixama,1
well that explains it lol,SSimpson,1
I've got classes and other stuff till pretty late today though :((,Trissin,1
no worries i understand,SSimpson,1
"If you guys decide on a time, I might be able to join as well. I still need to do whisper on one more character",Thawxtem,1
"Okay, so I recieved the emblem notification, but my emblems I was holding were full, and I can't even find the new emblem in the collections, nor postmaster",Thawxtem,1
It's not in collections?,Trissin,1
I can’t even find a space for it showing if I got it or not (unless it’s hidden/“unknown”),Thawxtem,1
probably the same issue as the lord of wolves one,Matos,1
"it doesn't go into collections until a later patch adds it,",Matos,1
anyone have a succinct list of new stuff in year 3? want to share with a friend,Matos,1
Best I can think of is the release trailer,Crizum,1
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LFYJTudJ540,Crizum,1
Skip to about 40 seconds and it starts listing the new stuff,Crizum,1
Specifically this is the free content ^,Arixama,1
"Armor 2.0, revamped nightfall system, finishers",Arixama,1
Plus the website does a reasonable good job of summarizing everything: https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Destiny/Shadowkeep?ciid=48001,RonInDune,1
got my 144hz boyssss,thegoaliebear,1
Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
i missed it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
What's a good background too,Arixama,1
Nice,LW Mugetsu,1
that background is so cool,Spitfire2266,1
yeah i have the Aksis one as my phone background. i was happy to find one with all four of them in the same background tho!,thegoaliebear,1
Hmm I just realized I haven't changed my background in a couple of years,RonInDune,1
Gotta look for some cool Destiny bg,RonInDune,1
this is my current one,Arixama,1
it shimmers,Arixama,1
oooh,RonInDune,1
is that using that steam animated background app?,RonInDune,1
"Wallpaper engine, yeah",Arixama,1
"I've never tried it, does it use up much system resources?",RonInDune,1
"I've never had any issues with it, but I'm sure it depends on resolution",Arixama,1
My current desktop is very creative and fun and full of energy.,RonInDune,1
I remember being absolutely obsessed with Rainmaker once,RonInDune,1
"made the fanciest desktops I could, they were janky as heck and made my system crawl but it was certainly unique",RonInDune,1
Wonder if there's a good Destiny themed rainmaker mod,RonInDune,1
Looked around for it a while about a year or so back. Couldn't find one,Oathbreaker,1
😿,RonInDune,1
new desktop,Arixama,1
Oh man that looks super cool,RonInDune,1
I'm v jealous,RonInDune,1
there ya go,Arixama,1
@Arixama have you played control?,Spitfire2266,1
@RonInDune and i both have,Arixama,1
its soo good,Spitfire2266,1
they did a very good job building the world and expanding their universe.,Arixama,1
remedy are my fav game devs alan wake and max payne are my favourite games of all time,Spitfire2266,1
"i wouldve loved to see quantum break references, but im glad we got some alan wake ones",Arixama,1
yea when i found the page from his typewriter i screamed a little,Spitfire2266,1
and all the bright falls references,Spitfire2266,1
I'm waiting for shadowkeep to blow me away but for now Control is my undisputed GOTY,RonInDune,1
i think sekiro is my goty rn,Spitfire2266,1
I went through the painful task of getting all the achievements in sekiro,Chance,1
but worth it,Chance,1
who was it that wanted to do the whisper mission?,thegoaliebear,1
i might be able to help tonight if i'm feeling well enough after i get home from my game.,thegoaliebear,1
Good job man,Oathbreaker,1
@Arixama when’s mountaintop happening?,Teddy,1
In 40 double kills,Arixama,1
gj!,Matos,1
anyone available to help me with the heroic whisper mission?,SSimpson,1
I'm going to go for Fabled today but I'm pretty sure it'll end really badly,RonInDune,1
Good luck @RonInDune !!,Trissin,1
I might be around later in the day @SSimpson,Trissin,1
I'll chant Oath's name everytime I'm losing,RonInDune,1
"Out doing my real world dailies, should be home in a bit if you still need help @SSimpson",Crizum,1
What're you at @RonInDune,Arixama,1
1530,RonInDune,1
okay!,SSimpson,1
"Just got a redrix with ricoshet/full bore and range masterwork, might keep it around",RonInDune,1
@RonInDune,Crizum,1
so uh.... just won an in-house tourney for 1000 silver,Oathbreaker,1
In another Discord,Oathbreaker,1
holy cow,RonInDune,1
congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
anyone running some raids later want to get the clan bounty for raids with a clanmate done,Spitfire2266,1
id love to run last wish im ashamed to admit ive never done riven legit,Spitfire2266,1
"Most people in the pc side of the clan haven't done riven legit, don't feel too bad 😂",Arixama,1
"I’m not ashamed to admit that, cause nobody ever wanted to when I ran it haha",Crizum,1
i really want to it looks like an amazing fight,Spitfire2266,1
“You wanna do Riven legit?” “You wanna teach me?” “So rockets it is”,Crizum,1
dont feel like ive earned my 1k voices😂,Spitfire2266,1
"Going through old emails, I found my code for Forsaken+season pass pre-order",Thawxtem,1
Huh did you get it twice?,RonInDune,1
No. I just never deleted the email.,Thawxtem,1
Oh nice,RonInDune,1
Overly paranoid,Thawxtem,1
One can never be too paranoid,RonInDune,1
I think we have at least 3 people who've done riven legit on the pc side of things?,Arixama,1
I've tried and failed,RonInDune,1
no one on lfg ever wants to do it,Spitfire2266,1
i think about 15 of my LW clears were legit riven.,thegoaliebear,1
you get a 1k voices to drop?,Spitfire2266,1
not until my 39th chest opened.,thegoaliebear,1
worst experience in the game for me. i nearly quit playing.,thegoaliebear,1
geez,Spitfire2266,1
0/10 would recommend.,thegoaliebear,1
just finished my raid exotic collection last week,Spitfire2266,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
got anarchy and tarrabah in one week,Spitfire2266,1
i dont think tarrabah is as garbage as everyone says,Spitfire2266,1
i don't have either of those but my new philosophy is that if it's not required for a raid title i don't care lol.,thegoaliebear,1
lol,Spitfire2266,1
I just want tarrabah to be 100% on exotics,Crizum,1
still need sturm,Spitfire2266,1
and worldline zero,Spitfire2266,1
Anyone down for Gambit prime later this evening?,Matos,1
Worldine zero is fairly easy to get these days,RonInDune,1
"@SSimpson poke me next time your around and we can do heroic whisper, aside from that @Matos if you don’t mind me using a bow I’ll probably be playing some prime",Crizum,1
i don't mind doing some prime as a 3 stack. if we get a 4th even better. i won't be on until like 9:45-10ish tho.,thegoaliebear,1
I’ve got @Donpablo with me,Crizum,1
sweet.,thegoaliebear,1
I can do some gambit prime,CrizMobius,1
@CrizMobius you can have my spot whenever they're playing I'm actually gonna head to sleep when i get home.,thegoaliebear,1
well my fabled progress is not ... progressing,RonInDune,1
down to 1478 now,RonInDune,1
sigh,RonInDune,1
Man I don't know how you guys did it,RonInDune,1
Every single game is against a 4 stack rocking lunas or reclus or MT,RonInDune,1
i definitely got lucky that the lfg group i rolled with was so good. but now that the only people left in pvp are the sweats who have all the weapons...i can't imagine how frustrating that must be.,thegoaliebear,1
i would help but i am not in the mindset for that currently haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"It's all good, kinda my fault for leaving it for the literal last day of the season lol",RonInDune,1
"i mean, start of the new season might not be a bad idea to get it finished. with the new ritual weapon, will likely have people using other stuff.",thegoaliebear,1
True true,RonInDune,1
I think the most important part of pvp is communication,Trissin,1
I grinded fabled for recluse a long time ago with littlepants,Trissin,1
"I did get a bunch of hate mail, if that counts lol",RonInDune,1
and then did the same thing again this season for mountaintop,Trissin,1
:(((,Trissin,1
"with the addition of the 3v3 and solo queue playlists, i think that will help a lot too.",thegoaliebear,1
"yeah, I think so",Trissin,1
yeah the solo queue playlist might be a godsend,RonInDune,1
like even just having 1 person to work with is such a help,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
getting stacks will be good and if you have to play solo at a given time you know you can get in with other solos.,thegoaliebear,1
and only play against other solos,Trissin,1
"yeah, hoping it really makes it better.",thegoaliebear,1
Comms make it so much better,Oathbreaker,1
"Take it from me, where I don't always 4-stack, I make sure I have at least one other person with me",Oathbreaker,1
Being able to communicate with someone and turn situations into 2vX's increase your chances of winning gunfights massively,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah. my team that got recluse with me wasn't like we were all god tier players. we were all 1.2-1.4 KDs but being able to talk and know who was going where, who was together, made everything so much easier.",thegoaliebear,1
"yeah I've won 1 out of 7 games I played today, and the one we won there were 3 on comms",RonInDune,1
I think I'm done for the season,RonInDune,1
i wouldn't bother burning yourself out with it.,thegoaliebear,1
Agreed,RonInDune,1
you're at a nice glory score right now. come back fresh when the next season starts and finish it up.,thegoaliebear,1
Seriously. The tourney I won today is a major showcase of that. The team we faced in Grand finals was almost definitely better than us in terms of pure skill. We were able to call out and leverage our advantage over the other team by playing *our* game rather than theirs. Comms and playing with someone is key in comp or scrims.,Oathbreaker,1
i think the solo playlist will help a lot because it will really come down to someone's individual skill. and then they will be able to increase their awareness and team play by recognizing that there will be more success by sticking with a teammate.,thegoaliebear,1
"If people have PvP questions, seriously, just reach out to me in a DM or on here. If you need advice just ask for it. More than happy to help. A year ago I was a half-baked potato in terms of skill, exactly a year later I've won a tourney against some nuts players.",Oathbreaker,1
"switching to 3v3 will give it a D1 Trials feel, which will be a welcome change and I think will make things more intense and competitive.",thegoaliebear,1
I wish it wasnt survival why cant we have skirmish,Spitfire2266,1
i don't mind survival that much. just anything but countdown LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
woah I just heard a new (to me) dialog from Tess,RonInDune,1
Something about how she's not the kind of awoken who fits into the dreaming city,RonInDune,1
hmm...interesting. i don't think i've heard that either.,thegoaliebear,1
survival is way better than countdown my god,Spitfire2266,1
i despise that game mode,Spitfire2266,1
if anyone would like to finish our 2 insurrection prime checkpoints tomorrow let me know @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
if not I'll just be doing some forge farming.,thegoaliebear,1
heck yeah I'm down,RonInDune,1
I can be around if you need,Crizum,1
I won't be around unfortunately. At least until very late,Arixama,1
no problem. I'd like to finish them but not a huge deal if not.,thegoaliebear,1
i think id be down,Spitfire2266,1
cool. likely would be around 9pm est. shouldn't take long.,thegoaliebear,1
At what time?,the_drake1997,1
I can be on then. Probably,Thawxtem,1
9est so 8pm central for you @the_drake1997,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
"ive never done that raid but i would like to learn, but if you are just trying to get it done fast i can sit it out and wait until another time",SSimpson,1
well we are only doing the boss. if you want to jump in i don't mind teaching that it's an easy fight. but if you want to learn the whole raid will just have to see if the others have time to teach the whole thing!,thegoaliebear,1
"oh well with shadowkeep i dont expect anyone to teach me lol its all good, if you guys need people ill always help out",SSimpson,1
and yeah i know its only one boss tonight no worries,SSimpson,1
it's totally fine if you want to learn the boss tonight we're happy to teach you! and we also might need a 6th lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"it doesn't take too long and we have 2 checkpoints for it, so there are two opportunities to learn the fight even more!",thegoaliebear,1
Also with shadowkeep coming up people are going to be rerunning all the raids for armor so im sure there will be plenty of opportunities,Arixama,1
^^ definitely. i know I'll be doing scourge and crown a lot for those sets.,thegoaliebear,1
and im not a bad player dont worry lol,SSimpson,1
but yeah if you're available tonight feel free to hop in. we're happy to teach you the fight!,thegoaliebear,1
"i have raid experience, alot actually, i just never played destiny 2 much after release",SSimpson,1
anyone know how you will get crucible armor for 2.0? (wing therorem)?,Matos,1
rank up packages ?? i honestly have no idea.,thegoaliebear,1
"damn, its one of a the few good warlock armor sets",Matos,1
@SSimpson don't worry haha we are a very chill raid group. we'd be glad to take you through the fight.,thegoaliebear,1
new keyboard coming this wednesday😋🔥,thegoaliebear,1
Siiick,Arixama,1
What kind of switches?,Matos,1
outemu blue.,thegoaliebear,1
"First mechanical keyboard or just a nice upgrade? Either way, life changing 😍",Salrus,1
how about both 😜,thegoaliebear,1
i'm excited as hell for it. comes wednesday so i'll be able to jump into Shadowkeep using it.,thegoaliebear,1
also just downloaded Office apps on my PC for school work i feel so powerful 😂,thegoaliebear,1
Does this clan have people on ps4 also? I’m mainly but I do have friends getting back into destiny that can’t afford one so I’ll be on ps4 sometimes too,SSimpson,1
Indeed we do,thikthird,1
yes.,thegoaliebear,1
Mainly pc* sorry typo,SSimpson,1
Okay cool,SSimpson,1
"So technically we have separate ps4 Xbox and pc clans, but we share a discord, so if you're in the pc branch of the clan and you play on ps4 you'll only see the people who are online on Ps4 in the pc clan",Arixama,1
Wait @thegoaliebear you moved to pc?,Nexeran,1
yup!,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I'm perfectly with helping someone learn the raid tonight,RonInDune,1
"Whoa nice, I'm torn between staying on PC or ps4",Nexeran,1
Oh but cross play... hmm,Nexeran,1
i just saw that keeping up two platforms would get way too expensive for me lol. i'd rather use the money a new playstation costs and put it toward upgrades.,thegoaliebear,1
Fair point,Nexeran,1
Join us nex,Trissin,1

"@Destiny [PC] ^ for those who were interested in getting into the new raid next Saturday night, here it is!",thegoaliebear,1
Pinned a message.,thegoaliebear,1
Good luck you guys!!!!,Trissin,1
im down,MrTster,1
lets do it,MrTster,1
Anybody know what light lvl min will be for raid?,MrJ,1
920?,MrJ,1
"I believe the first encounter is ~900, and the last encounter is ~ 935",Trissin,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
But those aren't the barriers to enter,Trissin,1
You will probably be able to enter the raid so long as you are 870+,Trissin,1
That's my guess,Trissin,1
likely yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
i would say at least getting above 900 won't be too bad and will be ideal. but there's no need to get over 920 as stated it won't provide any advantage.,thegoaliebear,1
I'd be down to do raid on sat just dont want to be too low,MrJ,1
"900 is the soft cap, right?",Trissin,1
Yes,Snorlax,1
i wonder what the best route for leveling is...just jam through the story and do milestones after that? or like...? what lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm not sure either,Trissin,1
"If 900 is the soft cap, that means blues alone can get us there",Trissin,1
It might be a good idea to abuse a loot cave,Trissin,1
Can vendor tokens you think,Crizum,1
And jump up to 900,Trissin,1
I dont think vendor tokens will up your light,Trissin,1
Do they??,Trissin,1
I've got like a million calus tokens in my vault,Trissin,1
"i want to do some min-maxing involving my warlock and hunter, but not going to go crazy over it.",thegoaliebear,1
YEAH CALUS TOKEN LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
if vendors help I'm gonna be on that so hard hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
😦 saved crucible tokens hope they work,MrJ,1
I wonder how much the new difficulty settings effect loot drops,Snorlax,1
"I don't think it changes loot, right?",Trissin,1
"Or maybe it does, i don't know about it",Trissin,1
"Higher the difficulty higher rewards, at least thats how it looked with nightfalls",Snorlax,1
"Oh right, that part",Trissin,1
"Yeah, youre right",Trissin,1
im so hyped for this expansion,SSimpson,1
^^^^,Trissin,1
i'm looking forward to creating builds we've never really had that,Snorlax,1
as in depth,Snorlax,1
here's the specific on what powerful rewards come from what:,thegoaliebear,1
RIP Pinnacle weapons,Snorlax,1
so it seems maybe grinding out the story and then doing milestones is a good way to go.,thegoaliebear,1
I know that in forsaken you could use vendors to up your light,Arixama,1
or doing some milestones before story too. that all would work.,thegoaliebear,1
From what I've heard ||We'll be underleveled for the first story mission. I believe it's going to be set at 760 or so. ||,Arixama,1
but yeah @MrJ if you'd like to try the raid with us on Saturday for sure join up on the lfg post!,thegoaliebear,1
that makes sense.,thegoaliebear,1
getting to 900 likely will be decently fast.,thegoaliebear,1
Gonna get the emblem this time. **i must**,Trissin,1
do you have a team already trissin?,Matos,1
haha I believe in you!,thegoaliebear,1
"I do, yes",Trissin,1
"A few are from my crown team, a few I haven't met before",Trissin,1
you will get it and then you can flex on us peasants 😩😩😂,thegoaliebear,1
"lool, who knows if i'll even get it or not!",Trissin,1
garden's gonna be real big,Trissin,1
"like last wish size, we're assuming",Trissin,1
what emblem?,Pentan,1
How close were you with crown?,Arixama,1
and i mean... only like 3 teams got that one,Trissin,1
"okay for crown, we got to the final boss in about 4.5 hours",Trissin,1
which was pretty good time I think,Trissin,1
@Pentan day one raid completion emblem,Arixama,1
but then one of our guys,Trissin,1
oh my god,Pentan,1
he got hit with a hurricane and his internet dropped,Trissin,1
trissin you mad man,Pentan,1
and we had to replace him with a pug and from there it was all downhill,Trissin,1
:((,Trissin,1
I really hope you get it tho. I'm really hoping that for one of the smaller season raids I'll be able to take a shot at a day one emblem.,thegoaliebear,1
ahaha thanks goal!,Trissin,1
but probably not until the spring season when I'm finally done with hockey lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Anybody obtain/have info on where in collections to find the hive event emblem?,Thawxtem,1
I found it on the first page,Trissin,1
it's in the events section for the emblems,thegoaliebear,1
I’ll look there when I get home thanks,Thawxtem,1
It's a white rarity emblem,Arixama,1
Here @Thawxtem,RonInDune,1
How many LFGs for the new raid do you think will require “1st day completion of CoS”?,Thawxtem,1
LOL,thegoaliebear,1
"Lol, not many don't worry",Trissin,1
"I didn't see a single day 1 crown lfg looking for day 1 scourge completions, and day 1 scourge isn't even rare at all",Trissin,1
"i really enjoy the posts like 2 hours after worlds first that are like ""must have experience""",thegoaliebear,1
"^
this part is fair",Trissin,1
i think those are more common than people wanting actual day one comps of a raid aha. still just as ridiculous tho😂,thegoaliebear,1
"If our team is on the boss and looking for one person to fill in, we expect they've completed all the parts up to the boss and are familiar with the core mechanics",Trissin,1
I'm really wondering how complex the mechanics will be in garden,Trissin,1
I'm so curious,Trissin,1
like this,thegoaliebear,1
LOL,Trissin,1
"If your looking for a specific encounter on day 1, experience needed is understandable, but the lfgs for the full raid on day 1 asking for experience is ridiculous",Arixama,1
^ yeah that.,thegoaliebear,1
god i remember vog. my first time trying i had no idea what it was and i was like 3 light levels under,Pentan,1
i don't even think i had full legendary gear,Pentan,1
i enjoy knowing that it's a vex raid tho.,thegoaliebear,1
i love to hear that haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"we finally made it in the door and i was like ""wait that wasn't it? that was so hard!""",Pentan,1
bungo should bring back old raids,MrJ,1
legitimately want old raids back,Pentan,1
yup,Pentan,1
i'd like to see how crota fares against grenade launcher meta,Pentan,1
probably not well,Pentan,1
i want WotM back😩😩😩,thegoaliebear,1
some of the most fun I've ever had raiding.,Trissin,1
it's just.. so...*good*,thegoaliebear,1
I remember once where we killed aksis like RIGHT as we wiped.,Trissin,1
"people slept on icebreaker for the first encounter of crota raid. body shots caused explosions, thing was busted for hordes of thrall",Pentan,1
oh what the heck,Trissin,1
ALSO GIVE ME SUNSINGER BACK PLEASE,Pentan,1
icebreaker for the darkness maze part?,Trissin,1
damn,Trissin,1
yup,Pentan,1
it was beautiful,Pentan,1
never thought of that,Trissin,1
i see how that works,Trissin,1
just wait for them to group and no-scope,Pentan,1
lol yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
"mark it as spoiler, i don't want to look at it",Pentan,1
😂,thegoaliebear,1
lol,MrJ,1
@Chance @ovenjohnson ^^^ see hilarity above,Pentan,1
also i may have mentioned this already but i uninstalled D2 from battle.net and bought shadowkeep deluxe + preloaded it on steam so it's ready to go,Pentan,1
yas.,thegoaliebear,1
Hey so question that may have been discussed here,Crizum,1
sadly trissin i can't join you on day 1 raiding. i have work that day and i just got a promotion so i don't really feel like calling out is the right play 😂,Pentan,1
Menagerie rewards from heroic come as masterworked the first run of the week right? Would that be a fast path to an upgrade?,Crizum,1
So you don’t have to dump a bunch of materials on new stuff,Crizum,1
🏏,Pentan,1
@Crizum i don't see why it wouldn't. if you do a run on each character that would be a nice upgrade for each. or just extra cores as well aha.,thegoaliebear,1
what,ovenjohnson,1
"but also you get 3 powerful rewards a week from the chalice, so even regular menagerie would be a good option for a boost.",thegoaliebear,1
i sell my soul to bungo,Chance,1
yes. i agree.,thegoaliebear,1
oooh I didn't know there was a cricket bat emoji,RonInDune,1
@Chance you sold your soul to me,ovenjohnson,1
"lol, no worries pentan. I think our group is already full anyways, so don't worry about it",Trissin,1
stfu ur name isnt bungo @ovenjohnson,Chance,1
anyone doing anything tonight?,Matos,1
We're doing Scourge a couple of times,RonInDune,1
I think,RonInDune,1
Not sure if we have enough people yet,RonInDune,1
Otherwise I'm going to try to get to 70000 triumph score,RonInDune,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
looks like we still need a couple.,thegoaliebear,1
@Matos You want to join in? It shouldn't take more than 15 mins if all goes well,RonInDune,1
hit me up if you still need one when you guys are forming,Matos,1
looks like you'd be our 6th @Matos . Shayne hasn't done it yet so we'd just be teaching him the fight if you don't mind that!,thegoaliebear,1
yea thats fine,Matos,1
sweet.,thegoaliebear,1
@Oathbreaker @Trissin gratz bois,Arixama,1
2 MAN ARGOS DONE,Oathbreaker,1
NIGHT BEFORE SHADOWKEEP,Oathbreaker,1
woah!,RonInDune,1
Congrats guys!!!!,RonInDune,1
awesome!,thegoaliebear,1
"Nice, congrats",Crizum,1
https://clips.twitch.tv/SuccessfulScaryGorillaHassanChop,Oathbreaker,1
Have overwatch comp practice on sat night wont be able to do raid. 😦 I'll unjoin the lfg.,MrJ,1
aww...no worries tho!,thegoaliebear,1
"😮 that's cool though, what rank are you mrj",Trissin,1
"im 2500 now, took a deep dive after being away from overwatch for a while was 3500",MrJ,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
"ohhh, damn that's pretty good mrj",Trissin,1
thx,MrJ,1
if you guys still need one for insurrection im down was gonna do it anyway,Spitfire2266,1
we just finished our checkpoints!,thegoaliebear,1
oh anyone get an anarchy?,Spitfire2266,1
nope haha.,thegoaliebear,1
but i did get a rampage/quickdraw on my ringing nail so...happy about that.,thegoaliebear,1
noice,Spitfire2266,1
Got my hard light catalyst done. 1000 kills is a bit too much sheesh,RonInDune,1
Also 70K triumph score woohoo,RonInDune,1
congrats!,thegoaliebear,1
whats up yall,Arixama,1
love to see it.,thegoaliebear,1
I want recluse and mountaintop so bad lol,SSimpson,1
Told you that you could do it,Oathbreaker,1
Haven’t even started,SSimpson,1
"well mountaintop is easier to get now. Recluse isn't too bad and I know Ron still needs to get it, so we might end up being able to get 4-stacks to help grind out the Fabled rank.",thegoaliebear,1
Remember that a) today is the last day to do it and b) comp next season is 3v3 survival,Oathbreaker,1
my boi looks so good,Arixama,1
Looking for 2 people to carry me plz in 3v3,Crizum,1
wait why is today the last day for Mountaintop?,Thawxtem,1
"It’s not, it’s the last day before rank resets and next season it isn’t 4v4 is what he means",Crizum,1
last day of the season to go for it,Oathbreaker,1
tomorrow at 1est there is 24 hour maintenance so D2 will be offline and unplayable,Oathbreaker,1
Randy’s Throwing Knife will be mine,Crizum,1
"well, i am certainly down to get the pvp stuff now that i know there are people who are chill going to those weapons haha.",thegoaliebear,1
"so if you havent dismantled all your bright dust stuff, make sure you get that done tonight",Arixama,1
I'm actutally shooting ppl with my pulse rifle right now for whatever that weapon may be.,Thawxtem,1
Redrix,Crizum,1
"Holy cow Ari, congrats!!!!",RonInDune,1
Gad damn,RonInDune,1
"Oh hey question for maybe Oath, or whoever else knows a bunch about drops",Crizum,1
I'm v v jealous,RonInDune,1
Hit it,Oathbreaker,1
"I missed my chance for service revolver back on season of opulence, but Hawthorne randomly graced me with one yesterday, is that now gonna be in my rank up loot pool for tokens?",Crizum,1
I don't actually know. Gonna go ahead and say yes?,Oathbreaker,1
If it's dropping in the clan engram probably?,Oathbreaker,1
Obviously I don't work at Bungie so I can't confirm but I'd think that's the case,Oathbreaker,1
you might have gotten the year one version back in the day as well,Arixama,1
"Yeah, if you got the Warmind version you have it unlocked already",Oathbreaker,1
"Maybe, but I couldn’t get Zavala to drop one previously and I’m saving tokens just in case so I guess I’ll confirm Tuesday",Crizum,1
And Shaxx is about to be fed like 3k cookies,Crizum,1
Check your collections for the S3 Service Revolver,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh, yeah that’s there. I must have just had poor luck from Zavala",Crizum,1
Zavala is a fickle bitch,Oathbreaker,1
Ari can confirm just how many times I have yelled at Zavala,Oathbreaker,1
I think I'll try one more time for Fabled,RonInDune,1
Good luck!,Crizum,1
If I get it I'll get both Recluse and Mountaintop so I'm pretty hyped,RonInDune,1
nice. might as well go for it.,thegoaliebear,1
"only thing to lose is glory, so really nothing to lose",Arixama,1
"theres no reason to keep eververse bounty notes, right?",Arixama,1
No,RonInDune,1
But you can dismantle them even after shadowkeep drops for dust,RonInDune,1
Shit I still have 300 to burn through,Oathbreaker,1
Oh also no use in buying fireteam medallions,Crizum,1
@Arixama congrats welcome to the club 👏🏻,Teddy,1
"Goodbye, Forsaken.",Thawxtem,1
"Hello, Shadowkeep.",Oathbreaker,1
Well this went well,RonInDune,1
I think I'll wait for next season,RonInDune,1
most people are doing a last minute push,Oathbreaker,1
would not have recommended,Oathbreaker,1
it is finished,Arixama,1
i'm about to uninstall it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"I think I'll wait until I can launch the game on steam, just in case there's stuff to sort out",RonInDune,1
I’m like 2k away from having a reset in Gambit which would finish part of notorious hustle and I think I’ll just avoid getting 21% delirium haha,Crizum,1
"welp, there it goes haha.",thegoaliebear,1
and now to uninstall blizzard.,thegoaliebear,1
adios,RonInDune,1
self care.,thegoaliebear,1
"Just over 36 hours until Shadowkeep. Get your affairs in order, get your doctor's notes ready to call in to work, and have your energy drinks prepped.",Arixama,1
*We do not condone actually calling in sick if you are not actually sick.,Arixama,1
@Destiny [PC] would anyone want to run the main story together tomorrow night? I'll get on around 9:15 EST and will likely be playing for a while.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm down,Peronix,1
Pm? If not I'm down,the_drake1997,1
yeah 915 pm est.,thegoaliebear,1
i don't get out of class until 745pm tomorrow lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Damn lol I'm on night class. Maybe next time,the_drake1997,1
"well, I'll be playing every night for a while this week haha. so I'm down to do more of it whenever.",thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear if you don't mind that I'll probably be through it once at the point, I'd definitely be down to run through it on another character",Arixama,1
that's totally fine!,thegoaliebear,1
I'm also considering deleting and remaking a character to experience new light as a 'new' player. See if there's any major differences,Arixama,1
cool. yeah i just wanna get through the story tomorrow night aha. will probs be watching streams of it during the day too.,thegoaliebear,1
"I've got the next 3 days off of work, so I'll be playing right at reset 🎆🎇🎉🎊",Arixama,1
"Heyo peeps. New to the group here, but not new to the game. Me and a buddy of mine will be attempting the 24 hour clear of the raid to get the unique Emblem and to let everyone know we have no life. If anyone here has plans to do the same, wanna try getting a group going if we can grind out to 890+ for the raid by the time the raid drops on Saturday?",Kit,1
"^^^
That's great, and welcome! I'm also chasing the day 1 clear, but unfortunately I'm already part of another team atm. But if anything spots come up mid run or anything, I might let ya know.

Btw, what are you + your buddy's battletags?",Trissin,1
*steam accounts. 😜,Arixama,1
"No, battle tags",Trissin,1
raid report lol,Trissin,1
"Gonna be honest - We're good at the raids but unfortunately haven't done them nearly as much as we'd like to. So if you check the Raid Report it's prolly not gonna be very impressive. PS4 LFG is usually a mess, and our clan is relatively inactive so getting a group going is rough.

I'll find our exact tags and edit the comment here.
My BT: Kitpaws#11113
My PSN: Kitpaws",Kit,1
"Okay, no worries!!",Trissin,1
"I believe some others in our clan are also going to be giving it a shot at the new raid on day 1, but I'm not sure of the details",Trissin,1
!LFG search,Arixama,1
@Kit we've got one set up not starting until 845 eastern that we need two for it looks like,Arixama,1
Ok sweet. I'll let my buddy know. How much time are you guys planning to dedicate to getting it completed?,Kit,1
"I'm not sure what peoples time limits are, honestly.",Arixama,1
"I’m west coast so I’ll be around until the east coasters can’t go on, unsure if @thegoaliebear has a game the next day or not",Crizum,1
What time does the raid launch? Can't get to most of the sites from work..,Kit,1
10am PST?,Kit,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
"@Arixama  I'll go ahead and sign up for it - If something comes up and we get into a team earlier, I'll go in as an alternative",Kit,1
Sounds good!,Arixama,1
"@thegoaliebear I’d love to join but I don’t get off work until 30 minutes after you start, so I’ll put myself as an alternate just in case",Thawxtem,1
Hmm wonder Bungie is planning here: https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/30/bungie-will-release-at-least-one-non-destiny-game-by-2025,RonInDune,1
Possible Myth or Oni remaster?,RonInDune,1
i don't have games on sundays. all i have is my afternoon game on saturday so i can go at the raid as long as people want to stay awake lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"so honestly...if we have a full group and we're all leveled decently enough, i don't mind a serious attempt at it looking up how teams trying worlds first have gotten through encounters.",thegoaliebear,1
I'd rather learn it than bang our heads against a wall not making any progress ya know lol.,thegoaliebear,1
@Thawxtem that's totally fine. i made it a bit earlier just so we know people would be online around then. but i don't mind starting a little later if it means we'll have a full group!,thegoaliebear,1
but @Kit i am legit fine attempting the raid all night and into sunday if people can lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Nice. Depending on if I’m also running the raid all morning then I should be good to raid up to 1-2am if not all night,Kit,1
"Jacklukeson, who joined earlier, should be our 6th. Just waiting for him to finish up the registration",Kit,1
"Fam if things go as planned I will be playing pc first when it launches. My birthday is Wednesday, and I have the day off so I plan to get as close to a 24 hr stream in as possible as I just spent this past weekend retooling my stream.  If anyone wants to join up and play post campaign I’m down.",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"Iiiiiiiiiffff my experience goes well I’d like to try the raid on pc as well, tho I’m more likely to do it on ps4 first. I guess that’ll be a wait and see kinda thing. But i have the weekend off.",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"Damn, I'm just going to take things at my pace, like I always do.",Matos,1
I normally do that but with how things lined up im gonna make an event out of it lol,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
@Kit sweet. we also try to keep the same group for a week 1 completion if possible given that we'll be spending a lot of time initially in the raid together aha.,thegoaliebear,1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) I'll definitely be playing for a while each night. gonna try and crank through the story tomorrow and then focus on leveling after that.,thegoaliebear,1
Yep yep @thegoaliebear - id like to raid too but idk how to join lmao. Says battlenet isnt linked but it is on my profile. Also with the switch to steam not sure how that will work. But ill be available,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
And if you wanna play while leveling thats dope,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
as long as you have cross save enabled and you have linked your steam account for cross save everything will be there.,thegoaliebear,1
Ya. I meant on here lol warmind aint working,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
For joining the raid,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
ohhh...yeah...it likely won't work for the entire maintenance now unfortunately lol.,thegoaliebear,1
but i will know you're an alt for that. i think we have a 6th rn but we'll see how things go as we get closer to it. we'll definitely have a group for it tho.,thegoaliebear,1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) try joining as an alt now? bc we just had the 6th person join it.,thegoaliebear,1
i also found out my 1230 class got cancelled tomorrow. so now can play at reset for like 2 hours🙌,thegoaliebear,1
https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1178732398512463872?s=19,Arixama,1
imagine getting into that server and muting it immediately.,thegoaliebear,1
aww,RonInDune,1
I'm just hoping we get discord integration again,Arixama,1
"Its currently basically a news and update channel, so I'm have all notifications turned on for it",Arixama,1
but...twitter.,thegoaliebear,1
but also that || dark intro screen || we love that for us.,thegoaliebear,1
"I have a lot of notifications that come from Twitter and since it groups them into one, I'll be more likely to see them coming from discord",Arixama,1
Doesn’t work @thegoaliebear,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i have the server muted but whenever i check discord I can just check it aha.,thegoaliebear,1
hmm...weird.,thegoaliebear,1
"Well maintainence has started, so that might be effecting it",Arixama,1
@thegoaliebear what time you gunna be on tomorrow? Right at reset or a bit after?,Arixama,1
right at reset until about 2:45 EST. then all night haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Sick, unless something goes horribly wrong, I'll be on at reset as well",Arixama,1
sounds good💯,thegoaliebear,1
Soundtrack is up on YouTube,Crizum,1
"First 25 minutes of New Light, i.e. the Cosmodrome mission is up on youtube: ||https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2ebBrn3_kE&feature=youtu.be||",RonInDune,1
ooh nice.,thegoaliebear,1
"You pick up a ||Khvostov||, wonder if they're that back as an exotic",RonInDune,1
Also wow is that mission pretty,RonInDune,1
could just be a nostalgic thing.,thegoaliebear,1
Is it the mission we played for Thunderlord?,Crizum,1
Or no I guess the D1 mission,Crizum,1
Different weather,RonInDune,1
Yeah the D1 mission,RonInDune,1
without Dinklebot sadly,RonInDune,1
Dinklebot was not good,Crizum,1
"He sounded bored and I don’t blame him, but it was just so flat and dry",Crizum,1
yeah honestly i didn't think he was that great.,thegoaliebear,1
Very true but I could listen to Peter Dinklage read the dictionary and not be bored,RonInDune,1
i feel like the voice we have with North just sounds more...idk...believable for our ghosts.,thegoaliebear,1
like it just fits ya know.,thegoaliebear,1
"I was gonna say they need to stop getting famous people to voice characters cause it’s hard to get them back, but they’ve had Lance Reddik back more than Hawthorne’s va so I dunno how they choose these things",Crizum,1
"Nolan bot is indeed very good, but he's in literally everything these days",RonInDune,1
I actually read an interview with I think it was Matt Mercer? Or could have been Nolan. A lot of voice actors have crazy range but they go in the booth and are told to do that one voice,Crizum,1
"Wish they'd have gotten someone like Logan Cunningham, whose voice has a ... different personality",RonInDune,1
I was scared we were getting Nathan Drakebot lol,Crizum,1
hahaha,thegoaliebear,1
I've never played or seen much of Uncharted. How good is he there?,RonInDune,1
Does he do the Nathan Fillion thing,RonInDune,1
"He’s good, but now most roles he’s in want him to do that voice",Crizum,1
"Dinklebot was like, bored Tyrion reading a book out loud",Crizum,1
True lol,RonInDune,1
Does Jen Taylor still do Cortana? Bungie tends to stick *to* their VAs,RonInDune,1
She does I believe,Crizum,1
They only killed Cayde cause Fillion got busy >_>,Crizum,1
😱,RonInDune,1
"Nolan North is a phenomenal VA, having actually seen the way he preforms when given leeway to do what he wants",Arixama,1
Cayde is dead? NOOOOOOOOOO,Oathbreaker,1
Shit sorry!,Crizum,1
That's some spoilers man 😦,Oathbreaker,1
/s,Oathbreaker,1
To be fair every guardian kinda is so,Crizum,1
"I mean, Fillion said that bungie didn't even reach out to him for forsaken, so it hard to know the actual motivation there",Arixama,1
"Yeah I dunno, maybe he cost more than reddik and Torres",Crizum,1
Destiny 3 will be the story of Cayde-7 taking down the deepstone crypt,RonInDune,1
And no idea why they got the dude from the mummy for Osiris and Deadpools girlfriend for his ghost,Crizum,1
Oh wait Sagira was Morena Baccarin????,RonInDune,1
Stephen Fry was in Warmind,Teddy,1
"I actually have a head cannon for how like, the destiny story could end whenever the franchise ends. pretty emo tho haha.",thegoaliebear,1
At this point the entire cast of Firefly has been in Destiny,RonInDune,1
How do you think it should all end goal?,RonInDune,1
John Carpenter helped on the Shadowkeep soundtrack,Crizum,1
Oh now I'm excited,RonInDune,1
"okay strap in boys and girls - so it has to do with Calus and continuing his story and all the lore about how he has ""seen the end."" essentially it follows the idea that we have become his Shadow and it could be like, the Universe actually is coming to an end. so we're trying to prepare for that. and when Calus proposes we become a Shadow he promises that even tho he will be the last being alive, we will still be by his side when the end comes. so basically a cinematic to end it all could be like, we're standing with Calus as the universe collapses or something. and we follow his wishes to be the last thing alive. we take our Ghost out, emo dialogue ensues, and we crush our ghost. then, like, everything goes black, and the OG Destiny title music starts playing as the game credits go.",thegoaliebear,1
"and then after the credits roll, there's a post credit cut scene where our Guardian wakes up in like, an alternate universe perhaps ? something that allows ideas of a story to continue.",thegoaliebear,1
Something like this: ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/opulent-duelist-greaves||,RonInDune,1
Yeah that'd be a good ending,RonInDune,1
"Calus is very much our nihilist sugar daddy, so I'm fine with going out in style by his side
||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/mcxliii#book-the-chronicon||",RonInDune,1
"Also we are no longer seeing the guardian level by their name, just the class",RonInDune,1
"Levels are gone, well the 1-50",Crizum,1
Everyone just starts at 750 light cause if they nuked us back down to 1 we’d riot,Crizum,1
The class signs will be nice to see who is what at a glance though,Crizum,1
Man those upgrade costs are insane,Crizum,1
stacking up mats is important and not infusing/upgrading until you get closer to cap unless you have an absolute god roll on something lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm usually good with letting my guardian look homeless for a little while.,thegoaliebear,1
helps in the end when I'm ready to infuse and upgrade my fave gear.,thegoaliebear,1
Feels like they do this every time,Crizum,1
Make insane costs for upgrades and let off the gas on them like two months in,Crizum,1
The good news is you don’t have to look like a hobo all the time with the ornament system,Crizum,1
The best thing about the grind is experimenting with all kinds of weapons,RonInDune,1
I learn how shite sidearms are every time an expansion drops,RonInDune,1
LOL yeah mood.,thegoaliebear,1
but for sure I'm grabbing those EV ornaments.,thegoaliebear,1
pooping those on EVERYTHING.,thegoaliebear,1
POPPING OH MY GOD,thegoaliebear,1
I'm not even gonna fix it.,thegoaliebear,1
that just about sums up my monday.,thegoaliebear,1
:justright:,Arixama,1
love that for me.,thegoaliebear,1
i watched three minutes of that video....,Matos,1
"for those who might also have ps4 or xb1 characters as their main account:
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1178804165964812289?s=19",thegoaliebear,1
and i will delete a character and use the khovstov,Matos,1
forever,Matos,1
"just make sure you log into the game on your main account first, and then you will be all set to go back to pc.",thegoaliebear,1
yeah i might delete my titan. throw all my fave gear in the vault and make a new one so i can play that mission and feel nostalgic haha.,thegoaliebear,1
i am still in awe at cross save for this game tho lol. i am so happy they made it a thing.,thegoaliebear,1
It'll be up as a daily heroic story mission apparently,RonInDune,1
oh,Matos,1
can i get it there?,Matos,1
yeah according to some weirdos on reddit,RonInDune,1
so basically confirmed,RonInDune,1
So will we all pop a whole bunch of achievements on steam the first time we log in?,Crizum,1
probably. the achievements for ps4 and xbox auto completed on login,Arixama,1
we love that for us.,thegoaliebear,1
I wonder what dark days Luke is talking about here: https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48187,RonInDune,1
my body is ready,Chance,1
but is it really,thegoaliebear,1
Can't wait for tomorrow evening really. Might stay off of social media entirely for the day,RonInDune,1
i'll be watching streams in class haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Probably in reference to the reception of launch D2, and the back and forth with Activision",Crizum,1
Man this feels bittersweet:,RonInDune,1
lol blizzard d2 walked so steam d2 could run.,thegoaliebear,1
"Also reminds me I never did finish Diablo 3, did half the campaign and got bored",RonInDune,1
Oh yeah prepare for the greatness that is steam,Crizum,1
lol,Trissin,1
When you check the library page for Destiny 2 do you have Forsaken content showing up in the dlc tab?,Crizum,1
could be the migration of the licenses?,thegoaliebear,1
with the maintenance i wouldn't be surprised if something like that pops up early.,thegoaliebear,1
they said the licenses wouldnt transfer right away might not even transfer till midway through day one or something,Spitfire2266,1
Yeah I just saw online some people were getting it showing up in their dlc purchase history so I was wondering if anyone here had that,Crizum,1
"yeah mine has the Forsaken stuff and the standard Shadowkeep listed. everything except Shadowkeep is labeled as ""installed""",thegoaliebear,1
so we will likely still have to download the shadowkeep update then?,thegoaliebear,1
my shadowkeep is listed as downloading,Arixama,1
hm...I'll check again later tonight. idk lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"i only have shadowkeep listed as well, so definitely weirdness",Arixama,1
oh yeah that is weird haha.,thegoaliebear,1
my guess is that it is probably wonky stuff going on right now as they migrate literally every PC players account to steam haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"This is what mine looks like and i just started installing after doing $35 shadowkeep version. Its installing 80gb worth, so I’m assuming it’s on track. In the purchase contents it said both Destiny 2 and Destiny 2: Shadowkeep",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
No mention of forsaken anywhere i could find,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Mine showed up just a little while ago,Crizum,1
"Where, can i ask? Like a separate piece of dlc or under the installed game?",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
if you don't have forsaken on pc it won't show up that's still a separate purchase. but after it installs the 80GB the year 1 stuff should show up as installed.,thegoaliebear,1
It looked like yours until about 30 minutes ago,Crizum,1
but yeah Criz that's exactly what mine looks like.,thegoaliebear,1
So the opposite of mine. Thats interesting,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I didnt play d2 on battlenet tho so when my dl is finished ill take a peak and see if it changed to match yours,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Ohhh i saw your msg goal - so you’re thinking there will be another update for sk tomorrow?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
possibly the patch download yes. at least that's just my guess aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"The 26gb~ equivalent that we preloaded on ps4? Would make sense we’d be able to do it on pc too. Fuck me ive spent all day stressed l, dealing with problems, i even uploaded a video of me exploding to invisible shit.
Ima go play some zelda",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Deal with this tomorrow (with my pc staying on reeeeeeee),obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
hahaha love that for you. but possibly yeah it makes sense. the game is definitely bigger than 80GB lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Mine hasn't updated to have forsaken. Generally with steam preloads, it downloads the entire thing encrypted and the last bit of the download that happens at launch is the decryption of all the data.",Arixama,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
"Went to battle.net and it auto-loaded the Destiny start page, and I love the Titan helm they chose for their picture",Thawxtem,1
the shadowkeep download will not take long tho. it took my ps4 20 minutes to download the patch which is what it took my pc to download the entire game that night LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
"If you're on Windows 10, I'll recommend checking if auto updates have installed KB4522738",RonInDune,1
"One of hte things it fixes is some audio problems, best to be on the safe side",RonInDune,1
So this is what my installed DLC page looks like:,RonInDune,1
So everything seems ready,RonInDune,1
where you find that at?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
On the game page itself,RonInDune,1
oh i will have to look at that.,thegoaliebear,1
Make sure you're on the steam beta branch,RonInDune,1
It's so much better,RonInDune,1
steam beta,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
oh shit,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
From Steam settings -> Account,RonInDune,1
i did that. i like this a lot more,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
mine still just has shadowkeep checked,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
basically your 2nd picture,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
whatever,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I think that means everything's fine,RonInDune,1
I hope,RonInDune,1
"ya. i didn't have forsaken on battlenet, so everything seems gucci. ill see ya'll tomorrow. thanks for the help",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
cheers,RonInDune,1
i just sent out friend requests on steam. weird that people weren't able to find me haha.,thegoaliebear,1
so this means i will be good to go tomorrow right?,thegoaliebear,1
Yup that seems perfect,RonInDune,1
awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
"Barring unforeseen catastrophe, you're good",RonInDune,1
also yes this steam beta is so nice.,thegoaliebear,1
modern and clean i like it.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I like the material design/metro UI style,RonInDune,1
Much prefer to the old blocky aesthetic or Apple's skeuomorph (now abandoned),RonInDune,1
my shadowkeep isn't downloading,Matos,1
"nvm, those are just the unlock keys",Matos,1
T-minus 5 hours until Shadowkeep. :ghost:,Arixama,1
i think my body is ready but only time will tell.,thegoaliebear,1
"If your body fails, ghost will just revive you. :2Smart4You:",Arixama,1
facts.,thegoaliebear,1
"Stuck at work for the rest of the day, can someone who is able to play check if vendor drops can go to 900 since it’s a soft cap",Crizum,1
"theyll definitely be able to drop at 900, but i kind of doubt theyll be able to upgrade you by themselves",Arixama,1
I forget how it worked with Forsaken. I can see how that makes sense though,Crizum,1
"with forsaken they were able to upgrade you, but gear was also level locked.",Arixama,1
"The contract I’m on at work is ending the 11th so I’m out of this job soon, which means there’s nothing to do really. I get to sit in a room with no tasks and just wish I was playing. Maybe if it gets real bad I can use the remote play app",Crizum,1
@Destiny [PC] Steam license transfers are complete!,Arixama,1
https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1179057038262800385,Arixama,1
"turns on ps4: ""PSN is currently undergoing maintenance""",thegoaliebear,1
:youtried:,Arixama,1
i should be fine with the season pass license tranferring tho right?,thegoaliebear,1
I'm still gonna try to log into the game on ps4.,thegoaliebear,1
Umm as long as the account you sign in on is your main I think you should be fine,Crizum,1
"weve got an hour left, so theres still time. im scared to log out of  my ps4 now :derp_blob:",Arixama,1
so my ps4 characters are my main and they are cross saved with my steam account.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm assuming that means i can log into them on pc and be fine then?,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah you should be good, you’ll still get the season pass you just may not get any collectors edition stuff until you log in your PS4",Crizum,1
okay sick.,thegoaliebear,1
but yeah I'm not logging out of ps4 now lol @Arixama,thegoaliebear,1
we love to see this.,thegoaliebear,1
"i picked up my ps4 copy like an hour or so ago, and have been logged in ever since.",Arixama,1
"Bungie: * is preparing probably their biggest release for the Destiny franchise in an hour *

Sony: yeah let's do psn maintenance right now!",thegoaliebear,1
it might be good tho my friends list just popped up!,thegoaliebear,1
yeah i would say definitely try to log in on ps4 first,Arixama,1
yeah i do not want to risk anything. this is a huge move for them AND for us so I'd rather make sure everything on my main character account it set.,thegoaliebear,1
"and they are really making sure people are careful with it too haha:
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1179064067148771328?s=19",thegoaliebear,1
it definitely sounds like if youve set up crosssave you should be fine no mater what platform for season pass,Arixama,1
@thegoaliebear since I’m in the same circumstance - can u send a confirmation msg here or wherever if/when it works? Won’t be home til 6. Thankies. Hope it goes smooth,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
yeah i will for sure let you know. while i assume I *would* be fine logging into PC since it's cross saved with my ps4 as my main account...always better safe than sorry.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm thinking that, for this week, I _might_ **temporarily** join a different clan for levelling and day one purposes, and then switch back to WIPE as soon as day 1 is over",Trissin,1

"A few different people, but yeah. There are quite a few bonuses for doing stuff with clanmates, and i am gonna be levelling through shadowkeep with my raid team",Trissin,1
So yeah. Just wanted to let people know,Trissin,1
we will miss you for the one day 😦,thegoaliebear,1

thanks @Samakain !!,Trissin,1
Good luck!,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
thank you!,Trissin,1
okay everything is listed as installed on steam 🙏,thegoaliebear,1
"mine is sitting in downloads, is it supposed to be there?",Trissin,1
this is what mine shows.,thegoaliebear,1
"yeah, it will download the last bit at launch to decrypt everything",Arixama,1
ah ok,Trissin,1
"all the dlc should be listed as installed, but destiny itself wont be quite yet",Arixama,1
Gah I wish I was ready to launch as soon as it dropped,RonInDune,1
it's 2:30am and I'm up and I'd like to posit that timezones are bullshit.,Samakain,1
I wonder for those of us who don’t have forsaken thru battlenet when that would go live on steam? I guess I’ll find out tonight. Sitting here at work like leeeeeeetttttsssss goooo,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1090150/,Arixama,1
that should be the store page for it,Arixama,1
I am on le phone,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Mine looks like a random page,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i have to click it twice for it to actually go,Arixama,1
So actium war rig new meta?,CrizMobius,1
Hmmmm,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Decrypting!,Trissin,1
yayaya mine just started downloading,thegoaliebear,1
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) since the store page exists, it should appear at launch",Arixama,1
You da champ Ari (psst can i call you that?),obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
ari is what i usually go by since it's easier 😂,Arixama,1
Dope. Aight guys back to work cya tonight. Good luck with everything keep me posted and most of all HAVE FUN,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"if people are having issues getting it to decrypt, just restart steam!",Arixama,1
OH NO,Arixama,1
?,thegoaliebear,1
it claims its gunna take 2 hours to unpack,Arixama,1
rip. mine is at 40 mins rn.,thegoaliebear,1
"That's what mine said, seconds later it's at 30 mins",Thawxtem,1
Will new light players start at less than 750 light?,Thawxtem,1
i think they start right at 750 ?,thegoaliebear,1
"Mine jumped from 1hr 30 to 4hrs and then back down,  so I don't trust it and I want to speak to it's manager.",Samakain,1
base light is 750 now,Arixama,1
yeah mine is fluctuating between 30-40 mins.,thegoaliebear,1
Hell yeah actium war rig @CrizMobius,Crizum,1
"Also this gives me hope? Soft Cap: 900
All drops up to this point will be upgrades to the most powerful item in your inventory or vault",Crizum,1
Depends on if they count Shaxx stuff as a drop,Crizum,1
heh heh heh... I'm gonna try and be the weakest player in Shadowkeep using a mask,Thawxtem,1
Think the mask is gonna be 750 lol,Crizum,1
worth a shot,Thawxtem,1
at least it means we won't get nerfed (like it matters) during halloween event,Thawxtem,1
The real way to be the weakest player is to have started a new character right before maintainence,Arixama,1
That's why I was asking about New Light,Thawxtem,1
They have that known issue where if you have a super low level character you’ll just have to delete it and start a new one,Crizum,1
Puts you at 0 power,Arixama,1
Man now I wish some streamer sweat did that and is saving a level 0 for iron banner,Crizum,1
with this download i really will be playing first on ps4 LOL,thegoaliebear,1
Saaaame,Arixama,1
"plan your tower visits wisely, it will probably take eons to load in and out of social spaces",Trissin,1
"ohno, did I say something controversial",Trissin,1
@thegoaliebear It will probably take 1 hour to login with all the players,CrizMobius,1
_several people are typing_,Trissin,1
like d3,CrizMobius,1
"You think you know the tower load times? I was born on the PS4, raised on it. I didn’t know the game could load quick until I was a man",Crizum,1
LOL,Trissin,1
hahahaha,Trissin,1
"hah yeah, i'm sure the servers will be backed up like hell.",thegoaliebear,1
"wait, I've never known the game to load quick. I wonder if Steam will fix that...",Thawxtem,1
I think you’re just cursed,Crizum,1
😦,Crizum,1
"When I really think about it, I got this computer to play Overwatch. Never have had any loading issues with it, only Destiny.",Thawxtem,1
It is a hog on mine too.,Samakain,1

"Hey, we're all bored right now",Thawxtem,1

haha,Samakain,1
I'm at class and I have my laptop unpacking destiny right now lol,RonInDune,1
hope noone notices,RonInDune,1
i can stream it on steam from my pc in my apartment,MrTster,1
@RonInDune multitasking,CrizMobius,1
I feel like I should have cancelled class today but I'd have to put in a good reason and I'm not sure how persuasive I can be lol,RonInDune,1
And I have office hours after this,RonInDune,1
I'm in!,CrizMobius,1
lucky.,thegoaliebear,1
i don't want to restart bc i feel like that'll just make it worse.,thegoaliebear,1
I think @LW Mugetsu is in as well,RonInDune,1
Anybody who isn't doing the story immediately feel like going to the Leviathan?,Thawxtem,1
Says it is temporarily at capacity.,LW Mugetsu,1
yeah LOL,thegoaliebear,1
its in queue just leave it and you will get in,CrizMobius,1
well i got to the accepting the terms and licenses then right back to queue aha.,thegoaliebear,1
omg I cant travel to the tower lol,CrizMobius,1
we LOVE this for us.,thegoaliebear,1
i waited in the 19 hour queues for tft i can deal with these queues,MrTster,1
https://tenor.com/view/rosemary-suffer-wwe-gif-13649109,RonInDune,1
Well no use to login if you cant travel anywhere,CrizMobius,1
😄,CrizMobius,1
we in boys.,thegoaliebear,1
i just needed to get in on ps4 so my season passes transferred aha.,thegoaliebear,1
so I'm assuming D2 is still playable even while its unpacking?,thegoaliebear,1
on PC.,thegoaliebear,1
nevermind got a weasel error and right back to queue LOL,thegoaliebear,1
wonder if there's a queue on D1 right now,RonInDune,1
by the time i get in I'll have to go to class,thegoaliebear,1

"Join a voice channel, hit the go live button and anyone in that channel can join your stream",Crizum,1
okay i got to orbit hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
Gratz!,Thawxtem,1
running around the tower on ps4 currently,Arixama,1
wrong platform Ari!,Matos,1
10 minutes til my pc is ready for it :BAha:,Arixama,1
loving all these UI and function changes already.,thegoaliebear,1
How come I don't have any of my titles in Disc?,Matos,1
"Just prompted me about Cross-save. If I only used battle.net, I should be safe, yes?",Thawxtem,1
yup,Arixama,1
"I am ""unpacking""",Matos,1
@Matos did you react to the post about them?,Arixama,1
....maybe,Matos,1
#role-assign,Arixama,1
alright...once I'm in the tower on ps4 i will hop to pc.,thegoaliebear,1
Using the app I can see the curated rolls on the ritual weapons,Crizum,1
Erianas Vow we love to see that.,thegoaliebear,1
"The vanguard and gambit ones seem nice, not sure about the crucible one",Crizum,1
Waiting to join (at full capacity) isn't so bad since this music is so nice.,link270,1

congrats!,Samakain,1
They really gonna get me to buy 2100 silver,Crizum,1

Nice to rack up a million steam achievements all at once.,link270,1
alrighty...and onto PC we go!,thegoaliebear,1
queue with me!,Arixama,1
i can play it if it's still unpacking yes?,thegoaliebear,1
i dont think so,Arixama,1
how close is it?,Arixama,1
probs like 75-80%,thegoaliebear,1
but i was able to go into the tower and get some gear on my Hunter. so everything should be good to go now.,thegoaliebear,1
the queue doesnt seem to take that long anyway,Arixama,1
now to roll up a new titan,Arixama,1
haha yeah i am strongly considering creating a new titan as well.,thegoaliebear,1
Already love new quests page,Thawxtem,1
i am kind of getting tired of his appearance tbh...i want him to look better too.,thegoaliebear,1
the armor 2.0 is very involved...it should be fun figuring out how to curate your builds exactly the way you want them.,thegoaliebear,1
i want to experience new destiny. and also im thinking of not running an exo at all,Arixama,1
see...i kind of like the idea of my titan being an Exo. idk why i made him a human.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm baffled with them leaning on the new eververse stuff why they still haven't added more character customization options and a barber or somethin. Seems like a no brainer.,Samakain,1
I've had the same haircut for 2 years ffs.,Samakain,1
i think being able to change hair styles and have beards and stuff would add to the continuity of our characters as well.,thegoaliebear,1
exactly.,Samakain,1
APPARENTLY SUBTITLES ARE INHERENTLY ENABLED,Arixama,1
If I was an exo you'd better be sure i'd be in for new detailing and body work every month or so.,Samakain,1
"Oh damn, looks like the season pass is per character",Crizum,1
I dunno why I thought it was per account,Crizum,1
i knew it...i literally have to go to class at like 2:45 lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
and i still have like 10 mins left on this unpacking.,thegoaliebear,1
ooof,Arixama,1
love that for me.,thegoaliebear,1
:rip:,Arixama,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
i will just be learning about the material and armor updates until i have to go. so i will be starting the story fresh tonight and will be streaming it in case you guys still want to join for it!,thegoaliebear,1
ill be running on a second character,Arixama,1
sounds good!,thegoaliebear,1
and it's...it's done. Time to que.,Samakain,1
RonInDune... All of our hard work for doing the dungeon with two people... it was for nothing.,Thawxtem,1

"So if I dismantle something with Hive Armaments, will it give it to me back, or will the mod be lost?",Thawxtem,1
old gear,Thawxtem,1
Yeah you get back your mods if you dismantle,RonInDune,1
(in Armour 1.0),RonInDune,1
I'm just wondering if that rule still applies to 1.0 armor in Shadowkeep,Thawxtem,1
only one way to find out!,RonInDune,1
"yes, confirmed.",Arixama,1
just did it,Arixama,1
Thanks Ari. It's the only armaments I've ever gotten,Thawxtem,1
"oh shit so with that armor set you get, you can put any eververse set as an ornament on it.",thegoaliebear,1
"i have 2, so if i lost it it wouldne be the end of the world 😂",Arixama,1
Wait... will there be Vex armaments now?!,Thawxtem,1
possibly,Arixama,1
If anyone spoils anything here I will write a *very* sternly worded letter,RonInDune,1
im glad steam names actually reflect in game,Arixama,1
Story/Lorewise or like armor system wise?,Crizum,1
Story/lore,RonInDune,1
Gotcha yeah that I understand haha,Crizum,1
If anyone spoils something I will 1v1 you until you cry,Oathbreaker,1
1v1 de_dust2 shields only,RonInDune,1
4 stock FD only Fox/Falco lets go,Crizum,1
THAT CENSORING THOUGH,Arixama,1
Woah who is that under Teddy hahaha,Crizum,1
buttkikker LOL,thegoaliebear,1
"Nah, Captain Falcon 4 stock on FD with no items",Oathbreaker,1
@Buttkikker confirmed too lewd for steam,RonInDune,1

fyi im going to be rocking a green ship forever now,Arixama,1
Don't tell me you're gonna be a Watermelon guy now,Oathbreaker,1

hmm,CrizMobius,1
i dont have anyone online in the clan,CrizMobius,1
can i change the server somewhere?,CrizMobius,1
"you came over from ps4, right?",Arixama,1
yes but i switched to the pc clan,CrizMobius,1
maybe i have to add you on steam first?,CrizMobius,1
"i know theres some issues going on right now due to maintenance so i cant look at the clan roster right now, might be affecting you?",Arixama,1
probably,CrizMobius,1
i can see my steam friends tho,CrizMobius,1
"Woo, confirmed you can reach the soft cap with vendor tokens",Crizum,1
"But the poster on reddit said it took about 2,800 tokens to hit 800 so I won’t be hitting 900 with them",Crizum,1
its a lot of rng as well,Arixama,1
"Yeah, if it’s weapons you lack for the upgrades I guess you could focus on gunsmith",Crizum,1
Maybe I’ll get a lucky exotic,Crizum,1
its also a very god way to get armor mods,Arixama,1
honestly you will probably level up decently through just the story. then milestones will be nice boosts as well all RNG considered haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I almost want to plan a raid rush day to just run through all of the old ones just for mods,Crizum,1
should i dismantle all my old armor? the new blue stuff they gave me is better i think,SSimpson,1
i just logged o,SSimpson,1
on*,SSimpson,1
If you don’t have specific rolls you are attached to go ahead,Crizum,1
"you can. and, if you have a mod equipped on that armor piece you will get it back so no worries about losing mods.",thegoaliebear,1
i deleted everything except my Crown and LW gear aha. until i get to running those again that armor will stay.,thegoaliebear,1
what about weapons?,SSimpson,1
"Weapons aren’t changing, so you can keep what you like using there",Crizum,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
ok so keep my old weapons i like? and i can use them freely?,SSimpson,1
yup!,thegoaliebear,1
i just will need to infuse them correct,SSimpson,1
everything got bumped to 750 i believe. but i wouldn't infuse anything right now.,thegoaliebear,1
okay,SSimpson,1
stack up on mats for when you're over 900 and whatnot. especially with how many blues and not great legendaries you're likely to get now while leveling.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah lvling with blues is fast enough,CrizMobius,1

everybody got booted,CrizMobius,1
Oh dang!,Samakain,1
Seeing stuff like this makes me think Shadowbringers probably set the standard for launches,Crizum,1
"""There's a lot of requests coming into the game server right now! It told us to chill out for a minute instead of giving us useful data, so we're all going to be little Fonzies and be cool until the game server recovers.""",Samakain,1
"The message on help forums, in a dialogue box.",Samakain,1
yeah...guess it wasn't so bad that i have class until 745 lol.,thegoaliebear,1
no part of me expected this launch to be smooth. i can't imagine how ridiculous it must be with New Light. maybe just a learning experience that they should have  launched New Light a week later? but it's here haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Peak engagement possibly, if anything maybe they should have released new light back in September to get people hooked before Shadowkeep",Crizum,1
Yeah it would have made sense to launch new light early.,link270,1
"i mean...it's done haha. but yeah, a game like this and all the content offered in New Light...i can imagine a ton of people have picked it up.",thegoaliebear,1
I've only done the first mission of shadowkeep 😂,Arixama,1

I don't think Steam's used to the Destiny setup yet,RonInDune,1
@thegoaliebear obviously I won't be running the story on a second character tonight 😂,Arixama,1

yooooo I just soloed that strike it was incredible!,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

it was a good strike for sure.,thegoaliebear,1

@Arixama @Thawxtem would you guys like to work on the story stuff again tonight?,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone seen the new catalysts and stuff?,Trissin,1
One guy in my team finished the Cerberus+1 catalyst yesterday,Trissin,1
I got the Cerberus+1 yesterday from the first thing I killed on the moon,Crizum,1
"Also, for those that don’t check reddit there’s a free powerful engram for being a Bungie rewards member",Crizum,1
"I see, did u finish it?? It sounds like a good catalyst but he said it was pretty useless",Trissin,1
I got the graviton lance cats on Friday and getting the cosmology kills is a pain.,LW Mugetsu,1
"I did not, I know it restricts the range if you hold square",Crizum,1
I feel like that’s a PvP centered catalyst cause the gun was already seeing some use right?,Crizum,1
"Oh, interesting. I didn't see it much in PvP, and personally I'm not a big fan of using it in crucible",Trissin,1
But I can see how that would help it yeah,Trissin,1
"Also nice @LW Mugetsu , but yeah that one's kind of a grind",Trissin,1
I thought it dropped in PVP but I got it running strikes,LW Mugetsu,1
"In year 1 it was from faction rallies, and then in year 2 they kinda just released it to any activity completion I think",Trissin,1
Same go for sunshot and sweet business,Trissin,1
"@Trissin I got and finished the cerberus catalyst, seems pretty cool but the ||alternate fire mode reduces speed dramatically||",Arixama,1
"ohh, okay",Trissin,1
Anyone planning on going into the raid blind on Saturday?,Infernosi,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
@Infernosi ^,thegoaliebear,1
don't think there is another group yet as a couple people are still unsure of their day 1 plans.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I would be getting on at around the same time as yesterday,Thawxtem,1
okay sounds good! i think you should be close to where ari and I got now. and i don't mind re-running the extra stuff you have for the drops lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone up for some crucible?,CrizMobius,1
i would but i have class soon :(,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone figure out how to get year 2 armor as 2.0?,Matos,1
Vendor stuff you mean?,Crizum,1
Like the vanguard/crucible?,Crizum,1
Anything that drops is 2.0. Any thing you pull except for exotics is 1.0,Arixama,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
"I'd definitely like to do a day 1 blind as well so if we could get a second group, I'm in",Sabre,1
i think it depends if kit and jack find a group to try it at launch. so hopefully we will know for sure because we might end up still needing two.,thegoaliebear,1
but i will let everyone know once things get set for sure. we will likely have enough for a second group tho.,thegoaliebear,1
I'll gladly join a group doing it.,Infernosi,1
awesome. i will keep yall posted.,thegoaliebear,1
Sounds good,Infernosi,1
So best part of Shadowkeep is drop kicking cursed thralls,Crizum,1
Gonna try to kick one in to fireteam members and see what happens,Crizum,1
i loveeee the finishers. it just feels so fun and looks badass.,thegoaliebear,1
I straight up paid for those legendary ones,Crizum,1
hahaha love that for you.,thegoaliebear,1
Drop kick was just too good,Crizum,1
isn't there a finisher or two in the season pass?,thegoaliebear,1
There’s the Belgian kick yeah,Crizum,1
i like the base hunter one and really enjoy that it changes the elemental animation for your subclass.,thegoaliebear,1
I like that if you jump and do a finisher it can change it. Spiked a servitor like a volleyball,Crizum,1
on hunter you literally toss an elbow right to the face haha it's great.,thegoaliebear,1

"@here I'm looking to do the nightfall 100k in a few hours. I matchmade it with a 1.6 multiplier, and it partied me to a 780 and 860 with a 1.0 and we got 38k score with my teammates contributing not much",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
100k should be super easy,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
just don't want to matchmake it cuz I'm not sure what's going on there,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
if i didn't have class and a lunch date i totally would. but i won't be on until like...845ish tonight most likely.,thegoaliebear,1

What LL are the nightfalls? 750?,Trissin,1
there are different levels of difficulty to them now.,thegoaliebear,1
and as the PL goes up the modifiers go nuts lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh, I see
You don't pick the modifiers anymore?",Trissin,1
"Kinda like d1, where they rotate?",Trissin,1
i think so? i haven't looked much into it but i have a quest to do the nightfall on adept difficulty which is the 750 one i believe.,thegoaliebear,1
Ah ok,Trissin,1
i have like 1.6k simulation seeds i should probably turn a bunch of those in LOL,thegoaliebear,1
Im up for some nightfalls later as well,CrizMobius,1
That haymaker finisher is great.,Matos,1
I wish I was damage immune during it,RonInDune,1
I thought you were immune for the duration of the finisher?,Trissin,1
I think I've been killed through it though,RonInDune,1
"lots of times, especially when I was underleveled and doing lost sectors",RonInDune,1
For sure not immune haha,Crizum,1
I wonder if the raid will have any mechanics like using finishers in sync or using finishers on plates etc,Crizum,1
"Interesting idea, although I don't think that will appear",Trissin,1
Who knows!,Trissin,1
Can you imagine a raid boss that will just revive forever until killed by an unprompted finisher?,Crizum,1
"Oh that would be really interesting lol, a raid boss that can only be killed through a finisher",Trissin,1
"Or like, you need your whole fireteam to run up and finish at the same time",Trissin,1
Lol,Trissin,1
That would be so awesome,Trissin,1
Yeah like it could be segmented and everyone damages and finishes their own spot on the enemy. Would put peoples personal dps above party dps though,Crizum,1
Couldn’t have the tractor cannon carry,Crizum,1

@Kit and @Ransom  ty vm,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) what kind of drops did you get from the NF and high score? PL wise what was the jump in the slot?,thegoaliebear,1
you are not immune in the finisher,Matos,1
just go into a group of thrall and finish one,Matos,1
"the others wail on you, you may have some damage mitigation",Matos,1
I believe you just lose a bit of aggro,Infernosi,1

@Destiny [PC] i am hopping on now if anyone would like to continue story stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
particularly the Mysterious Disturbance mission.,thegoaliebear,1
"Well, 24 hours is over. I ended on a sweet pvp note. Only game I played, after delirious I went pretty positive and felt great with controller. threw that stereotype right out the window i was stuntin on some fellas. But I need food. and sleep. Take care yall. 

For those wondering (basically no one), I got to level 12 in the season pass. Have no idea of the pace of that, wasn't really focused on it. Got to 906-7 power, with some powerful stuff in easy access. The 1st level of Nightfall is relatively straightforward and simple, and the 920 tier is fucking brutal. Mostly because it is a huge spike in difficulty and there's some strategy involved for sure. @Kit  and @Ransom were a big help in us getting thru it, props to them. 

I'll prolly hop on for a tiny bit tomorrow, might play more pvp. The new map is actually really good, even tho I only played it once, I think it's well designed. But I'll def keep prepping and maybe squeeze my way in for raiding this weekend. I know there's already a group. Idk I need to figure that shit out since I'm gonna spend time playing ps4.",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

Hey guys do you know if theres a set group for garden of salvation yet and what time you guys would be starting,Spitfire2266,1
@Spitfire2266 we have one set up for saturday night at 845pm EST.,thegoaliebear,1
"Wow, so many people in our clan interested in day 1!!",Trissin,1
"depending on what people's plans look like closer to saturday, it looks like we will definitely have enough for 2 groups.",thegoaliebear,1
Glad we have so many keen raiders,Trissin,1
Make a second group!,Trissin,1
It's the first time I'll be able to try for a completion day one.,Infernosi,1
"WIPE will get World's first , you heard it here first folks",RonInDune,1
hahaha definitely.,thegoaliebear,1
"It may be a good idea to gauge what everyone plays, would it be best to try and set up two groups of 2 of each class?",Crizum,1
hoping to start at launch if the second group is open to starting in the morning/afternoon,Spitfire2266,1
I'd love to.,Infernosi,1
Too bad I’ll be out of town on Raid day otherwise I’d jump in on this group too.,link270,1
"@Kit @Ransom looks like a second group is looking to form to go into the raid at launch. if you guys would prefer that, then that's all good we have alternates for the night run.",thegoaliebear,1
but just lmk!,thegoaliebear,1
Apparently I'm not getting progress on ||Eriana's Vow catalyst|| doing nightfalls?,RonInDune,1

Eww I loaded in to the tower on PS4 to pick up my free engram and that stutter in the tower and menus...,Crizum,1
All my silver is on my Xbox so if I want to purchase stuff I have to log in on that and it is jarringly different than PC.,LW Mugetsu,1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) awesome. i should be on around 8 EST.,thegoaliebear,1
when i first logged into ps4 when SK launched i saw those 30 frames and i was like,thegoaliebear,1
Is silver such that my 300 on ps4 and 1000 on pc need to be spent separately?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

Fix it after we all get 24 hour raid clear emblems,Crizum,1
It’s for sure a glitch cause what’s happening is you aren’t being taken out of your sprint when firing the shotgun,Crizum,1
Yeah,Kit,1
!lfg,Kit,1
!lfg search,Kit,1
"@thegoaliebear Yea, I think @Kit and I would prefer the initial release launch group as we're trying to get the 24 hour clear emblem, who is heading that group up?",Ransom,1
We're both around 911-912 as of last night,Ransom,1
no one as of yet. once the api is up I'll see who we have for the night run and who else will be available for a launch attempt.,thegoaliebear,1
but doesn't seem like anyone will be *not* ready for it in terms of PL.,thegoaliebear,1
I think it's up now aint it? Ishtar and such is working now,Kit,1
!lfg search,Crizum,1
so @Buttkikker and @Thawxtem you guys have the first alt spots for the night raid day 1. yall still good for it?,thegoaliebear,1
"with so many people, why isn't there a launch group and a night group?",Trissin,1
I'm not sure how many of those in the post as alts are available right at the launch tho.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
"i know there's like...4 who said they would be, but they aren't from that post i believe.",thegoaliebear,1
so @Kit @Ransom if you guys could join that one ^ and take off of the night run that would be great so we have the groups set.,thegoaliebear,1
Well.. if the other group doesnt get going then I don't want to lose my spot in the later group.,Kit,1
It should let you join both right?,Trissin,1
gotcha that's fine!,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ we have a day one raid post set up for saturday at launch. if you will be available right at launch and would like to attempt it make sure to join the lfg post above so you have a spot in the group!,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I put myself as alt because I won't be available until 9pm CT (10 for you),Thawxtem,1
gotcha. we will probably start around the scheduled start time so no worries we will have people. but I'll definitely keep you updated.,thegoaliebear,1
?,Thawxtem,1
welp,RonInDune,1
pretend noone saw that,RonInDune,1
My question still remains,Thawxtem,1
copy paste error lol,RonInDune,1
i didn't see it but now I'm curious lol.,thegoaliebear,1
bunch of random gibberish,Thawxtem,1
love it.,thegoaliebear,1
I'll probably stream the learning stuff on Saturday,MrTster,1
yeah i won't be able to watch like...any of it bc of my game. but. I'll definitely try to look at stuff after and I'm not opposed to knowing the mechanics beforehand for as far as the launch groups get.,thegoaliebear,1
but if people want to try it blind at first I'll totally respect that aha.,thegoaliebear,1
how do I do that,GustingWind,1
do what,thegoaliebear,1

if we could get these groups set that would be great. ik some of yall in the launch group are in the night run as well and i don't want people to get screwed out of that run if spots are taken up that aren't really occupied and whatnot.,thegoaliebear,1

But being underleveled makes it way too risky,Trissin,1
you will die too much,Trissin,1
"even for like boss dps, can't risk getting stomped",Trissin,1

Raid trailer is up || https://m.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=27&v=LxIOfW3UTKI||,Crizum,1
yeah honestly i don't think it will be that useful. like Trissin said being underleveled makes playing your life way more important especially if you're trying to learn the encounters legit without someone dying every second😂,thegoaliebear,1
Good thing it's a fairly generic trailer and not much is spoiled,RonInDune,1

you just need to re-register with Warmind so do the `!register` command and sign in with your main bungie account again.,thegoaliebear,1

Are the scoring cards still in the game?,Trissin,1
"Or challenge cards, I think they're called",Trissin,1
"For regular nightfalls, not the ordeal ones",Infernosi,1
wait why is our clan tag shortened,Chance,1
waht the hecky,Chance,1
Name is too,Infernosi,1
what the hecky,Chance,1
i want a refund,Chance,1
why was it changed,Chance,1
was it forced,Chance,1
Seems like it,Infernosi,1
I presume it's a glitch,Infernosi,1
They rolled out a patch to the WEASEL errors that truncated (shortened) clan names. It'll be fixed in a later update,Oathbreaker,1
damn rip,Chance,1

went from 916 to 919 in 3 games,Spitfire2266,1
so happy,Spitfire2266,1
didnt realize every sub rank drops a powerful,Spitfire2266,1
Yep.,Infernosi,1
just need 1 power more on any piece should be 920 was worried i wouldnt be able to raid on my main,Spitfire2266,1
My plan for tomorrow is to hop back on PS4 where I can still do decently at pvp and go as far as I can.,Infernosi,1
"Speaking of which. Reposting from pvp section since this applies heavily for this section and people transitioning from console to pvp, like myself.

also @Spitfire2266 ty for the heads up on comp. Will be grinding that tomorrow for sure,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

i would be down to get into some comp for those drops today. got nothing going on so i can be on at any point.,thegoaliebear,1
and also don't mind making some progress on earned glory for the pvp ritual weapon aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I would like to play comp too,SSimpson,1
I need all the weapons,SSimpson,1
awesome. I'll ping you guys when I'm on might have two groups since comp is 3v3 now aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I'll be sure to say hello if I do end up queuing tonight and run into you : ),Oathbreaker,1
"Lol, I might be grinding some PvP tonight as well.",Trissin,1
"Lol, well if you end up needing a 6th let me know",Crizum,1
I’ve been grinding so much crucible it’s not ok,GustingWind,1
"Like, the addiction is present",GustingWind,1
Lol,Trissin,1
I’ve been avoiding powerful rewards on Titan until I finish up Hunter at the very least so I can hit that 920,Crizum,1
But I’ve been wanting to run some crucible so if people want to group at some point,Crizum,1
I won't be able to raid day 1 so I'm personally less worried about getting to 920 or whatever really,Oathbreaker,1
"I misunderstood and thought you needed to clear by this next reset for the jacket, turns out we have until the 14th so it’s less of a pressing thing for me haha",Crizum,1
well it seems like we'll have enough people for comp today at various points lol. I'll probs be on kinda early like 5 EST unless i end up having plans.,thegoaliebear,1
I finish teaching at 6,GustingWind,1

well i cant play till later anyways,MrTster,1
Re-register with warmind,Arixama,1
ah thank you,MrTster,1
i got it to work now,MrTster,1
cool. I'll be on for a bit anyways tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
Prob be on 6ish tonight. Still want to do that mission too @thegoaliebear if you finish the step you’re on,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
sounds good. I'll probs hop on a bit earlier to finish it.,thegoaliebear,1
hopefully i get decent rng with my drops tonight. I'm at 909 so I'll be fine for raid I'll definitely get over 910 tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
Apparently you can turn in resources to devrim to round out your gear level if you have some items that are below and keeping you behind,Kit,1
They’ll drop at your max level,Kit,1
Also get and do all the dailies you can go push up your artifact rank for them extra spicy levels c:,Kit,1
"Thinking I’ll skip grinding on Warlock, just finish my powerfuls on Hunter and do Titan to hopefully get past that 920 mark",Crizum,1
yeah i need to try that again. i got unlucky last time i tried and got same drops for my already highest slots lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
I’d join up for pvp but I’m gonna help the fiancé through the story and then prolly run with my buds on PS4,Kit,1
Haven’t played with them in awhile D:,Kit,1
no worries have fun haha.,thegoaliebear,1
and finally hit 910 🙂 the grind continues.,thegoaliebear,1
Isn’t comp 3v3 now?,SSimpson,1
it is,Oathbreaker,1
3v3 survival only,Oathbreaker,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
good riddance for countdown,Oathbreaker,1
thank god haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Matches feel so much faster now,Infernosi,1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) i am on the last part of the exotic quest so we can do that as well when you're on tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
going to do 3 gambit matches if anyone would like to join.,thegoaliebear,1
fellas where do I add my Steam profile to the Warmind bot,Sabre,1
I can't find it,Sabre,1
just do the `!register` command again.,thegoaliebear,1
sick thanks,Sabre,1
👍,thegoaliebear,1
about to be doing the absolute bare minimum in these gambit matches lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Just enough to get 8 bounties done,Infernosi,1
i'm not that committed lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Can just do the prime bounties anyway,Crizum,1
Just generate 8 of them cause they're super easy to do,Arixama,1
"my policy is, i'll pick up gambit bounties and if they don't get done by the end of my 3 weekly matches they're never getting done lmao.",thegoaliebear,1
the prime daily ones for the different roles are easier.,thegoaliebear,1
but even then. i'm still not that committed.,thegoaliebear,1
How many powerful have you burned through?,Infernosi,1
gambit is my last one.,thegoaliebear,1
also have 4 more crucible bounties.,thegoaliebear,1
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1180209638744055808?s=09,Arixama,1
:o,Trissin,1
LOL,Crizum,1
they're actually disabling the reload grips too,Trissin,1
Wtf? Even Peregrine Greaves?,Oathbreaker,1
With the new punch combo?,Trissin,1
"I'm sorry, that's stupid. Those two, unless they're bugged and allow for bullshit easy buttons within the raid, shouldn't be disabled.",Oathbreaker,1
"Oh shit, that's right",Oathbreaker,1
Grasps didn't need to be touched,Trissin,1
The Jotunn ornament should now be made free for day one finsihers now imo,RonInDune,1
That shoulder charge/12P combo is actually nuts,Oathbreaker,1
"Well, that’s assuming they didn’t have a bug that was less publicized",Crizum,1
"No, no bug",Trissin,1
jotunn and greaves i get. don't really care about grasps. but it makes sense. prevent everyone from running titans and doing stupid shit.,thegoaliebear,1
"I mean that being said, it's a legitimate strategy",Oathbreaker,1
Grasps disabled for the auto reload,Trissin,1
Nah there's gotta be some bug,Arixama,1
Transversieves auto reload and they're not disabled,Arixama,1
there's been no case where a worlds first was not counted because the team didn't have enough class diversity,Oathbreaker,1
So running all titans shouldn't be an issue,Oathbreaker,1
i mean i don't really know why it would even be insanely useful given that people are gonna be dying a shit ton anyway trying to figure out the mechanics lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Transversives require you running around for about 2/3 seconds,Oathbreaker,1
but i just understand where they're coming from. it just puts everyone on a more level playing field come raid launch.,thegoaliebear,1
With the greaves it’s probably because whatever they touched screwed up and are allowing something that shouldn’t be happening,Crizum,1
yeah. there had to be something else going on for it to be disabled.,thegoaliebear,1
And while most people who stream and play a lot have them it would honestly suck to have a real shot at world first and get screwed by the rng of not having an exotic,Crizum,1
^^^,thegoaliebear,1
@Crizum Did you not see the video of 1-2 punch and the greaves..?,Kit,1
Its absolutely broken,Kit,1
No I did I mean they bugged something when fixing the liars handshake thing,Crizum,1
"Yeah, as such it needed to be disabled for the raid launch to give everyone a fair chance",Kit,1
You couldn’t shoot without losing momentum before Shadowkeep,Crizum,1
Yeah,Kit,1
I was talking about grasps having some unknown bug,Crizum,1
"like, ik most people who legit go for world's first are the streamers, but putting everyone at the same playing field is definitely the right move.",thegoaliebear,1
"Even world first aside, first 24hr is still big",Kit,1
But yeah they likely would've just ran in with 6 titans to get that spot,Kit,1
For the grips.. I'd say its because they want to get rid of the **instant** auto reloading stuff. They were pretty serious about it in their talks about how it effects the game and why they're removing the function from barricade and lunas. I'd say it makes sense for them to want it gone too from the other. Probably just need to disable the ability for it to proc off burn/dot damage,Kit,1
"yeah i think that was more precautionary across the board stuff for the auto reloading. if you're on hunter you're likely to be using OR, RF, or CN. but grasps could definitely be used to give a potential instant advantage in dps stuff if teams really wanted to go that route.",thegoaliebear,1
yeah for sure. toss some hunters in there with grips and mountian top or swarm..,Kit,1
"Not that it would be any different from how things were before, but its not their goal with the new sandbox",Kit,1
i just like that they are taking the measures to make sure everyone has the most equal shot at completing it since you can never wager that everyone attempting stuff like that has all that gear.,thegoaliebear,1
Yus,Kit,1
I'm super glad they're doing it,Kit,1
"Maybe, but if that was the goal why didn’t they touch them when they did the barricade and lunafaction adjustments",Crizum,1
"Maybe it slipped past them? I mean, I never heard of anyone doing it until right at launch",Kit,1
could be.,thegoaliebear,1
They got a shit ton of items and combinations in the game. Their dev team cant test them all.. prolly no one thought about it lol,Kit,1

But that's how it's been working for how long now?,Oathbreaker,1
thats not an arguement on why it shouldnt be fixed/disabled tho :b,Kit,1
right but the whole point of this is to take away auto reloading stuff.,thegoaliebear,1

@Destiny [PC] working on leveling my warlock now until i play comp. just starting the story and char is at 856.,thegoaliebear,1
if anyone wants to join or has an alt they want to work on as well.,thegoaliebear,1
Goal do you know the trick to getting your alt characters to 900 right away?,SSimpson,1
"Did they not specifically say that they were gonna leave Sealed Ahamkara Grasps alone though? If not, then fine, I'll let it be for day 1 stuff but if you leave something as is then remove it because that's the way it's worked and you feel like that's gonna break things, then you shouldn't be leaving it as is

Dunno if that makes sense",Oathbreaker,1
They specifically called out the grasps as something falling to the wayside because of lunafaction and barricade,Crizum,1
@SSimpson you transfer your weapons and then pull a blue armor set from your collections. then you get the armor pieces from the season pass. then pull the blue set again until the PL stops increasing.,thegoaliebear,1
But I don’t think they intended for burn damage to trigger them,Crizum,1
"Right so if they don't want them left at the wayside and leave them unchanged, then immediately remove them for Day 1 stuff.... That just doesn't make sense to me.",Oathbreaker,1
They probably intend to patch it but can’t get it out in time,Crizum,1
average people end up anywhere between 850-870 so you'll get to 900 just from the story drops and whatnot scaling up @SSimpson,thegoaliebear,1
"But the burn damage has triggered them since Forsaken, has it not?",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah well Bungo,Crizum,1
Yeah I just got my warlock and titan to 905 in like 10 minutes lol,SSimpson,1
"So the excuse becomes ""Yeah well bungo"". Trust me, I know that there's a load of ""Yeah well bungo"" shit that's gone on, especially with regards to PvP, but disabling something for Day 1 raid attempts because it's really good now that you've removed every other source of it and that's how it's been working for over a year now.... Idk, I think that's really fucking stupid lmao",Oathbreaker,1
Oh I agree I just try to remember they released whisper in to the sandbox only to nerf it when it was functioning as intended,Crizum,1
I also think it’s likely they wanted to fix it but couldn’t get it figured out before Shadowkeep. But who knows cause communication isn’t always their strong suit,Crizum,1
"I mean I didn't like it at the time, but that was big power creep and in hindsight needed to be done. It was too versatile at times. Meanwhile, Sealed Ahamkara Grasps aren't the best for everything, and likely are relegated to specific bosses that you can get the burn damage consistently on",Oathbreaker,1

Short range and far range options,Infernosi,1
Ad clears and dps for both slots,Infernosi,1
Gear with the mods,Infernosi,1
"Barrier, etc.",Infernosi,1
Spare infusion material in case we need something in the middle,Infernosi,1
"^^
I would recommend some gear like izanagi, outbreak, whisper, maybe deathbringer and MT",Trissin,1
"@Kit moutaintop, recluse and anarchy would be a good start then adapt from there",CrizMobius,1
maybe also infuse one exotic for the subclass you're most likely to run but no need to go crazy with it. I'm 915 and put on an exotic i pulled from collections and I was 913.,thegoaliebear,1
so it won't bring you down so much. but if you really want to maximize your PL for the last encounter getting one up is probably good. but even then you will get drops along the way from the encounters anyway so maybe not too important as the weapons.,thegoaliebear,1
so for tonight @Crizum @Arixama @MrTster @Nahkriin @Buttkikker you are all still good for the raid? i know Nahkriin said he might be a little late but long as everyone is still available that's all that matters!,thegoaliebear,1
i am,MrTster,1
"@Kit outbreak might be good. Izanagi could be strong. Sole survivor or another sniper with firing line will be dope. Recluse, loaded question, spike grenade launchers, swords w whirlwind, auto rifle/hand cannon for combatant shields, im trying to have my bases covered",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"That said idk what my light level will end up looking like. Rn I’m 916 but power and robe slot are way below (like 906 and 909), so im gonna do deathbringer mission to shore up 1 and then hopefully get the robes from essence on moon - devrim wasnt nice to me and i couldn’t find robes",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
that PL is perfect for the raid and yeah if you play at all before launch time just see what kind of drops you get before you infuse. i actually modded up my armor set the other night just having each piece with 5 energy slots and going from there.,thegoaliebear,1

It’s not a requirement,Teddy,1
"that is a bad argument.

if we are looking at requirements, then you don't need ANYTHING to play the game",Matos,1
Recluse was really the only weapon that seemed worth the grind to me. the prior pinnacle weapons were definitely pvp oriented which is always how it should be.,thegoaliebear,1

@Matos The example picture you gave was horrible. That look to be a very competitive game and a close one at that. Just because you finished with a high kill death doesn’t mean you should always win. I think PVP is really fun and really creative and it’s easy to get very salty and upset about it because you run into a stack team. But that’s going to be the case with any game as well as sometimes you always don’t play the best and sometimes your parents don’t always buy the best or vice versa. The problem does live with SB am in though but the picture you posted was a poor example of it. I do think there should be more of a ranking system similar to overwatch or league. Also for what it’s worth never usually as a game to equate to anything being good. That was the worst experience I’ve ever had in a video game and saying that D2 pvp is worse than that is a stretchhhhhhhh.,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

"Dropping PvP out entirely would kill my enjoyment of the game. I play this game because of PvP, PvE is fun but it gets so fucking boring. It is the exact same encounters on lockout each week. There's no variety. You play PvP and it means you actually have to think about what you're doing rather than just being bored because of the same shit, just different day. I have found no other PvP based game that is even remotely close to how Destiny feels. There's a reason I've stuck with this game. It's the Crucible.",Oathbreaker,1
"I enjoyed Borderlands 2 for a single playthrough, even with friends. Subsequent playthroughs are the exact fucking same. There's no variety. Oh, yay, bigger numbers, they deal more damage.

Not having MT/Recluse for PvE isn't the same as not having Anarchy for PvP,Crizum,1
Ritual weapons are a step in the right direction cause they aren't OP. Crucible has a harsh learning curve though for new players,Crizum,1
"Hard disagree on it being the worst PvP shooter. Yes, there's bullshit moments. Every fucking game has bullshit moments. You want to tell me that this is less enjoyable than COD with its near instant TTKs and little options for skill based outplays? Because D2 has good TTKs, good expression of skill in methods of outplaying someone, good movement, good gunplay. Matos, how often have you, or Ari, or ANYONE, heard me bitch about Bungie not fixing something yet? The PvP community doesn't give them a pass. We play the fucking game though because it's the game we have.",Oathbreaker,1

aRo - T1,Infernosi,1
i had to leave,MrTster,1
if someone wants to learn about the raid,MrTster,1
there is a spot open,MrTster,1
in raid bravo,MrTster,1
aggghhh this freaking boss,Trissin,1
is so annoying,Trissin,1
this takes forever,Trissin,1
Raid?,Infernosi,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Which encounter?,Infernosi,1
the boss,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
thats why im upset,Trissin,1
So if anyone wants to run the ||Divinity quest steps in the raid|| after contest mode is over lemme know!,RonInDune,1
"@RonInDune I think ||you need to run the whole raid doing steps after each encounter yes?|| I know myself, @Arixama and @Buttkikker are on that step",Crizum,1
"I think so, i haven't seen any video outlining everything yet",RonInDune,1
"||I went into the raid to see if I can do anything solo, but it's impossible||",RonInDune,1
We may have a group forming for later if enough are interested,Crizum,1
||The first tether requires atleast 4 people I feel like||,RonInDune,1
Hmm maybe I can join after contest is over,RonInDune,1
Only two hours until it’s over,Crizum,1
true true,RonInDune,1
I'll be available around 6 central,Arixama,1
depends when i finish my work today but yeah i think like 7ish est i should be good.,thegoaliebear,1
Lol Titans can solo ||grab all Voltec charges in the garden using the same method they can solo Dul Incarnu||,Crizum,1
have to stop around 11 tho. but without being level capped i think that first encounter will be much better LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
Is it similar to the ||Spire mechanic wher you can pop your super and greed stacks reset?||,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, ||using banner shield you don’t die and your stacks stay at 2, you can then continue to grab stacks and it won’t go beyond 2 so you don’t die||",Crizum,1
how exactly do you start the divinity quest?,thegoaliebear,1
||Go to the start of the raid  location in patrol||,RonInDune,1
||Kill what you see until a boss and it'll drop the quest||,RonInDune,1
cool.,thegoaliebear,1
"||On the moon load in to sorrows harbor, head to the lunar battlegrounds and turn left in to a cave to get to the raid portal, kill things until boss spawns. Lost sectors on Nessus after, kill Vex in the Incursion, then you should be on the raid step||",Crizum,1
"i had a thing where it said ""requires eye on the moon"" or whatever for the vex incursion is that what that is?",thegoaliebear,1
i have no idea what quests or whatever i have at this point I was way too tired last night to remember lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"For that you gotta hang around after any public event on the moon, not sure if it has to be heroic",Crizum,1
After the event is over you’ll see vex invade and you need to kill three gate lords and a mind,Crizum,1
Go talk to Ikora to start that,RonInDune,1
oh i have that then i already did one of those yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
"The Vex Offensive feels very rewarding BTW, maybe not quite as good as Menagerie but way easier",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, at some point this season I wanna set up a group to go for a deathless run for Undying",Crizum,1
That should be fairly easy,RonInDune,1
well i will be going for both Undying and Enlightened so. count me in whenever we get to that point aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I did a personal deathless run until I lept off the ledge trying to explore at the end,RonInDune,1
well I think I'm giving up on my Ludum Dare run so I'll probably be awake at 6-ish central,RonInDune,1
alright. as it gets closer to the evening we will see how many people we have for a potential raid. getting through that first encounter would be really nice and hopefully have enough time to at least start and get used to the second encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
If we're on power the first encounter shouldn't be quite as annoying hopefully,RonInDune,1
Not getting constantly one shot helps,RonInDune,1
yeah the first encounter is 890 i believe since the boss is 940. so we will have a level advantage going into that first one and a little for the second encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh I'm still 917 I think so later encounters might be tough,RonInDune,1
Maybe I'll do some PvP to get quick light,RonInDune,1
i would be down for some pvp as well for the drops. do those powerful drops only come from comp or do they also drop from ranking up valor?,thegoaliebear,1
"Comp is just faster cause you get glory and valor, but they should come from all rank ups",Crizum,1
There’s also the 100k nightfall if anyone wants to try that with me haha,Crizum,1
oh sick. hm...maybe I'll see what that solo queue playlist is like but quickplay is usually easier for me if I'm solo aha.,thegoaliebear,1
oh I'm down for that too!,thegoaliebear,1
I need to do the 100k Nightfall as well,Matos,1
sweet. when are you guys available today?,thegoaliebear,1
yup,Matos,1
anytime really,Matos,1
okay. i am going to try an get on for a bit maybe around 230 est.,thegoaliebear,1
That should work for me,Crizum,1
awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
rip no emblem :(((,Trissin,1
"we got the boss down to like, a quarter-ish hp",Trissin,1
after 2 damage phases,Trissin,1
:(((,Trissin,1
aww :/ well congrats on getting that far tho!,thegoaliebear,1
Aha ty,Trissin,1
"Dang, well there’s always next time!",Crizum,1
Jelly. Good stuff @Trissin,Kit,1
how do i get to the raid entrance from patrol?,thegoaliebear,1
If you wanna join me I can show you,Crizum,1
sure thing.,thegoaliebear,1
how did you guys do in the raid?,Spitfire2266,1
Which group?,Infernosi,1
"Haha, ty kit. Excited to complete the raid with out clan in the future!",Trissin,1
It's a fun one.,Trissin,1
"Later group didn't get past the first encounter, but we were only able to try for an hour or two",Arixama,1
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to join me and criz for some pvp?,thegoaliebear,1
I made it to the final boss but didn’t end up finishing wasn’t sure if the clan needed extras would be happy to finish with the clan. The group we were in had a really self centred ass that would take any ideas,Spitfire2266,1
So that means a bunch of people will get the emblem who haven't finished during contest,RonInDune,1
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,Trissin,1
i stopped going at 10am pdt,Trissin,1
cuz i thought it was over,Trissin,1
holy crap,Trissin,1
we were so close,Trissin,1
we got through multiple damage phases and got the boss low,Trissin,1
AHHHHHHHHHH,Trissin,1
😭,Trissin,1
Oooof,Arixama,1
@Destiny [PC] anyone want to join for the garbage that is comp pvp?,thegoaliebear,1
sure give me moment,RonInDune,1

"@Destiny [PC] who would be interested in trying the first encounter of the raid tonight? so far i know me, ron, crizum, and ari would. so we would need 2 more.",thegoaliebear,1
I can,Kit,1
@Ransom,Kit,1
So Sweat and co. have one phased ||the consecrated mind|| using mostly izanagi and wendigo.,RonInDune,1
Want to fill the last spot? We have experienced,Kit,1
||https://twitter.com/Sweatcicle/status/1180984815648198656||,RonInDune,1
Oh and Teawrex posted all ||the Divinity quest steps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ9ChUOphNk&feature=youtu.be||,RonInDune,1
@thegoaliebear I’ll join,Kit,1
What time?,Kit,1
@thegoaliebear I might be a available depending on the time,Ransom,1
I'll be back home in a few hours,Ransom,1
i have a hard stop at 11 est. so. any time before then.,thegoaliebear,1
Are you looking to only do the first encounter?,Kit,1
likely will be all i have time for yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
@Arixama give me 5-10 mins finishing vex offensive lol can't believe that was censored 😂,thegoaliebear,1
it wasnt censored for me?,Arixama,1
oh weird it was on mine haha.,thegoaliebear,1
What are yall up to right now? Still PVP?,Salrus,1
@thegoaliebear @Matos,Salrus,1
yeah we are in comp rn.,thegoaliebear,1
invite me whenever,Salrus,1
we are doing quickplay clash rn if you want to join?,thegoaliebear,1
watching for when someone leaves,Salrus,1
Gotta restart real quick first,Salrus,1
"Hey so can any of these Leviathan keys be accessed solo?
Irrigation/Drain/Pipeline",RonInDune,1
"Irrigation you can definitely access by yourself. Drain and Pipeline are watcher rooms, but drain is pretty easy and you should be able to solo that one",Trissin,1
"Pipeline might be a bit more difficult, but I think you can do it
It's the really big watcher room with 2 floors and the colossus, where you enter & exit from pipes. (Near the throne room)",Trissin,1
"Ohh yeah I remember, thanks trissin!",RonInDune,1
And keys go away at Tuesday reset?,RonInDune,1
"Hey @Trissin in encounter 3 ||how were you damaging the boss? He runs so fast, stagger mods?||",Crizum,1
"I think so, unless they're in your postmaster",Trissin,1
"@Crizum ||Big thing here is that tether slows the boss down a little bit. Our team used izanagi, whisper, darci, and 1kv for damage||",Trissin,1
"||Lack of hunters may have been the issue, no tethers||",Crizum,1
"||Part of it is just hitting those shots, they're easy to miss but izanagi's does such big damage on those crits||",Trissin,1
"||A lot of encounters in garden really demonstrated the power of izanagi's burden, it's definitely the meta moving forward. It doesn't depend on heavy ammo, and can output so much damage - both as a total in reserves, and also as immediate burst||",Trissin,1
"||Izanagi's is how Sweat and co. used to one phase the boss, and did so pretty easily||",RonInDune,1
^^,Trissin,1
||They pre placed wells all along the route||,RonInDune,1
"I ||wanted armor, of any slot, got a shotgun and a bow :/||",Crizum,1
Lol I got the bow too.,Trissin,1
How is the bow? Oh and has anyone here gotten ||Divinity yet?||,RonInDune,1
"I'll get that eventually, it's on my big todo list",Trissin,1
I'll need to get that catalyst for izanagi's ASAP,Matos,1
"It's actually pretty busy for me this time of the year in terms of irl stuff, but I think my current goal is to snatch that new raid title: || _""Enlightened""_ ||",Trissin,1
"I think there are some others here who need to run heroic menagerie as well, and I don't mind joining",Trissin,1
Yeah I don’t mind helping,Crizum,1
maybe we can knock out a quick run tomorrow,Matos,1
so who would like to do the first raid encounter maybe the second one tonight? would be around 8est for me. I'd like to try it before reset! @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
I don't think I have anything going on!! I'd be down. What light level is ideal?,the_drake1997,1
890 for first encounter and 900-910 for second i believe.,thegoaliebear,1
"Ok, I'll be ok then. I'm like 904, 905",the_drake1997,1
cool.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
okay i made a post for anyone interested. @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
ey ill actually be around! def down to learn this!,ruGGed_koala,1
okay cool. just make sure you are as close to 910 as possible for the first couple encounters.,thegoaliebear,1
I should be 920 on all classes and getting Izanagi's catalyst rn 😄,ruGGed_koala,1
okay great.,thegoaliebear,1
@the_drake1997 just make sure to add yourself to the lfg post so your spot isn't taken don't want there to be confusion tonight aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Added myself as an alt, won’t be home until about 30 or so after the start time",Crizum,1
I'm in!,the_drake1997,1
so full group and a couple alts in case awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
Just watched Ehroars video on the raid exotic. Need to get that thing lol,Crizum,1
yeah. i am more concerned with completing the raid first haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Seems like the quest is account based though. Was running titan last night and eris had the final step as an abandoned quest for me,Arixama,1
Almost had the third encounter down but it was almost midnight,Crizum,1
if you have to get it in one go of the raid then I'm not concerned about it right now haha.,thegoaliebear,1
but it seems easy enough to do within the raid itself.,thegoaliebear,1
Huh there'll be a Destiny 2 speedrun at GDQ this year,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/Shockwve/status/1181008724208558080,RonInDune,1
"AGDQ, yeah?",Arixama,1
Probably!,RonInDune,1
It'd be great if they do a petras,Arixama,1
Hopefully that'll be a donation incentive,Arixama,1
I'll be on around 630 before the raid to grind out some strikes for Edgewise and the vanguard shaders/emblem quest steps. if people wanna join then lmk!,thegoaliebear,1
also for the crucible quest for the emblem. it says reach valor Heroic. i am Heroic III and i played an extra match but it still didn't tick the box as completed. is this a bug or like...what? if people have had the same thing lmk.,thegoaliebear,1
Are you maybe glory rank heroic 3?,Crizum,1
i'm valor heroic 3. not sure what 1450 glory corresponds to tho.,thegoaliebear,1
heroic 2 for glory. but it specifically says Valor rank Heroic. so i am confused why it isn't registering aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Looking at the quest online I’d bet on it being glitched since the previous step was also heroic rank, so maybe see if it checks off when you get the next rank",Crizum,1
yeah it is probably glitched. figures haha. guess i'll just grind out the next rank before the raid then.,thegoaliebear,1
Hahaha in the raid you can ||push the third encounter boss off a cliff with smoke grenades|| excellent callback to ||vault of glass||,Crizum,1
can we try that lol.,thegoaliebear,1
no need for those snipers now😂,thegoaliebear,1
"So, for those who have new raid exp... recommended light level/fast way to reach said level?",Thawxtem,1
if you're over 890 you're fine for first encounter. boss is recommended at 940.,thegoaliebear,1
so. essentially just doing your milestones that give powerful rewards.,thegoaliebear,1
"if you have the time start leveling another character for more min-max strategies. but not 100% necessary. also, ranking up in comp or Quickplay gives a pretty powerful reward.",thegoaliebear,1
Competitive crucible if you can get wins is a quickish way to get your power up after you do your milestones,Crizum,1
so i would honestly recommend playing some crucible lol.,thegoaliebear,1
:rip:,Thawxtem,1
I’m at like 937 after comp and leveling hunter before Titan,Crizum,1
But we had a guy in my run last night at 900 for the third encounter and he was doing good,Crizum,1
i also don't think the crucible rank up powerfuls are limited to one. when i dropped a rank in comp then ranked up again after winning i still got a powerful drop for it.,thegoaliebear,1
every glory rank up is a powerful right now,Oathbreaker,1
no clue why,Oathbreaker,1
The only reason we didn’t get the clear is it was midnight and the ||motes team|| couldn’t figure it out,Crizum,1
I'm not in a huge rush to complete the raid tbh. i have a ton of IRL stuff going on so if it takes me an extra week for leveling and learning I'm fine with that. I'm focusing on getting the Undying badge stuff i find the ritual weapons a grindddd lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I just want to move forward on the moon/ unlock vex offensive,Thawxtem,1
I just want a jacket code,Crizum,1
Plus I want to get undying and enlightened and they aware both so grindy,Crizum,1
haha i respect it. I'm broke so i wouldn't get it anyway😂 if i end up in a group that completes it this week I'll happily give my code to someone.,thegoaliebear,1
Plus if I get the clear/experience it makes it easier to help out clan runs haha,Crizum,1
enlightened I'm less worried about considering it's all raid related and the raid will always be there. but with undying it's seasonal so i want to get the grindy stuff out of the way asap.,thegoaliebear,1
"oh wait, undying is limited to this season and won't be obtainable after?",Trissin,1
"Correct, vex offensive is this season only",Crizum,1
yup,thegoaliebear,1
"So you’ll need to do all the ritual weapon quests, and the shader/emblem quests",Crizum,1
are they long?,Trissin,1
they are grindy yes.,thegoaliebear,1
"Crucible is, as expected, the worst of them",Crizum,1
"^
no surprise there",Trissin,1
what kind of grind is it?,Trissin,1
yeah I'm about 40% overall done with Edgewise and i hadn't even curated my loadouts for it.,thegoaliebear,1
like complete vex offensive 100 times,Trissin,1
or like slay 5000 vex,Trissin,1
or idk,Trissin,1
"complete the offensive, kill a bunch of stuff with different weapon types...defeat the bosses.",thegoaliebear,1
that doesnt sound horrible,Trissin,1
yet,Trissin,1
it's pretty standard and then there are also a couple for killing stuff on the moon using various subclass elements.,thegoaliebear,1
it really isn't a *hard* title...just super grindy.,thegoaliebear,1
"hmm, kill stuff on the moon is kind of annoying
there arent very many ads around",Trissin,1
gotcha,Trissin,1
"By far the worst part is the ritual weapons, and the only terrible one is crucible cause it’s all scout rifle kills",Crizum,1
not even mad tbh. jade rabbit is my child,Trissin,1
farming lost sectors i would imagine would make the subclass kills easy.,thegoaliebear,1
"okay, I think i get the gist of it. it does sound sorta tedious but I think it could have been a lot worse",Trissin,1
i'm really really glad the pvp is scout kills and not something else,Trissin,1
I'm almost done with my arc kills. void I'll do on my titan tho bc...melee kills haha.,thegoaliebear,1
because scouts are like all I use lol,Trissin,1
Final blows is only annoying cause it’s a 6 person match made activity,Crizum,1
I'm at 86% for my SMG multikills as well. I'm really just focusing on doing one weapon type at a time since it clearly progresses quickly that's after only 3 runs of vex offensive.,thegoaliebear,1
it also could be worth getting a full team of 6 together so people can let others farm out the kills.,thegoaliebear,1
These may be frustrating,Crizum,1
"|| Rapid Assault: In the Vex Offensive, close the warp gate before 10 minutes elapse.
Precise Assault: In the Vex Offensive, close the warp gate before any gate node is activated.||",Crizum,1
how exactly does tgat work?,thegoaliebear,1
essentially just burn the boss into oblivion lol?,thegoaliebear,1
"I guess so, may want to group up for it lol",Crizum,1
"I also think the bosses rotate, so maybe it isn’t possible this week",Crizum,1
is vex offensive a 6 person activity?,Trissin,1
yeah...kind of like for some menagerie triumphs getting a full group made it easier to coordinate.,thegoaliebear,1
It is yes,Crizum,1
Warlock tickle fingers melts ads super hard,RonInDune,1
"I see, does the boss have any mechanics?",Trissin,1
or just a sponge,Trissin,1
this week you have to break his shield using void craniums that drop from minotaurs.,thegoaliebear,1
then there's like a 20 second damage phase before he goes to the next area.,thegoaliebear,1
i do think a coordinated team with full heavy could melt him. last night my group of randos got him down to about a third health in the first phase.,thegoaliebear,1
The more people that are firing on it at one time the faster the shield breaks,Crizum,1
I'll probably run it with a group then,Trissin,1
I’m sure something like weapons of light rally barricade or Luna well Izanagis could destroy it,Crizum,1
Seems like you could just delete him,Trissin,1
"We've killed him in one phase pretty regularly, with melting point, bubble and izanagis",RonInDune,1
and killing the boss closes the warp gate?,Trissin,1
I haven't done vex offensive yet,Trissin,1
yarp,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, again that’s assuming it’s possible on this boss and not the ||Undying Mind|| since it’s likely on a rotation",Crizum,1
Oh nvm it counts as closing just checked my cleats,Crizum,1
so @@RonInDune  you should have that triumph then assuming it's possible on any boss. but if you don't then it's likely another boss.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm down to try one phasing today if people are on before the raid.,thegoaliebear,1
I think I do maybe,RonInDune,1
You have to get all the triumphs for season of Undying as well,Crizum,1
So that gate lords eye power bonus is a grind,Crizum,1
I'm trying to crank out the weapon and shader/emblem quests first.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh yeah, apparently I heard that people got the day 1 emblem for completing between 10am and 12pm the next day due to the maintenance",Trissin,1
but also that during that time contest mode was turned off??,Trissin,1
so that means some people got it without contest on?,Trissin,1
how much power bonus do you need to get on the eye for the triumph? the max which is 15 right?,thegoaliebear,1
20,Crizum,1
There is no max,Crizum,1
oof.,thegoaliebear,1
so just hitting 20 then.,thegoaliebear,1
"is there even an efficient way to increase the levels you get from it? like, does xp earned from bounties help a lot maybe?",thegoaliebear,1
So the guy that finished the season pass has a +13 on the gate lords eye,Crizum,1
And his method was || The majority of my Exp (after Season Rank 50) came from Eris Bounties. I would buy as many as I could for 3k Glimmer and then head to the K1 Logistics Lost Sector to complete them. On a good run I could finish all 5. Delete Tidal Lock as it's trash... then repeat. It's very grindy but you get a level about every 3-5 Lost Sector runs.||,Crizum,1
Garden of Salvation t-shirt:,Trissin,1
tempted to do that exp grind on reading week,Oathbreaker,1
shred through the season ranks,Oathbreaker,1
I'm already at 26 or 27,Arixama,1
I'm only at like 12 lol,Oathbreaker,1
been working and studying,Oathbreaker,1
"||1,400,000 exp to go from a +13 on gate lord to +14||",Crizum,1
Sitting at plus 6 power I believe,Arixama,1
😭 i wish I had a fall reading week,Trissin,1
yeah i think I'm +6 as well. I'll have to do that lost sector/bounty farm tho in between doing other stuff haha.,thegoaliebear,1
what's reading week?,RonInDune,1
study for exams.,thegoaliebear,1
ohhh,RonInDune,1
I mean,Oathbreaker,1
It definitely makes sense for the grind to increase  the grind past like +10,Arixama,1
I only have 1 exam after reading week,Oathbreaker,1
at least at my university we have optional classes all week so...i just stay in and do nothing lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
we have an away trip during our reading week so i can't even have that full time since we're gone Thursday-sunday  :)))),thegoaliebear,1
i cannot wait to be done with this lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"I try to not set midterms that require extensive revisions lol, mostly if you've attended class you'll muddle through",RonInDune,1
I have midterms essays due in like 3 weeks and they're both 2-3 pages so not bad. but I've started to outline them now so i can just crank them out when I'm ready.,thegoaliebear,1
Hey @thegoaliebear your favorite just three manned Garden,Crizum,1
Wait was it Gladd you didn’t like or Goth,Crizum,1
Gladd.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah it was him lol,Crizum,1
i just hate his attitude.,thegoaliebear,1
not my vibe lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
anyone down for a quick heroic menagerie tonight?,Matos,1
i don't think I'll have time depending how long we go with the raid.,thegoaliebear,1
but if we just go for a couple hours i could do a heroic run after.,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] i am hopping on now if anyone would like to join. i will just be doing pvp to make progress on the ritual weapon and quest for the emblem.,thegoaliebear,1
50% on those scout rifle kills...only 18% for medals and kills tho lmao rip.,thegoaliebear,1
!LFG search,Arixama,1
"Just a heads up I may be *slightly* late because we're doing a birthday dinner for my niece, but it'll only be a couple minutes",Arixama,1
no worries.,thegoaliebear,1
@Matos what time for heroic? I need to do that.. haven’t yet.,Kit,1
"I don't think i'll be on tonight because i'm swamped in homework, assignments, and midterms atm",Trissin,1
"so the gambit quest is bugged as well. says reach ""Brave"" for the first step and i am past brave by now and it did not check off.",thegoaliebear,1
worked fine for me,Buttkikker,1
i picked it up after tho i was already Guardian II.,thegoaliebear,1
so it might not be retroactive ?? but i doubt that,thegoaliebear,1
Insane suggestion. Try logging into ps4?,Arixama,1
Maybe there's some weird desync with cross save,Arixama,1
wow never thought of that. i am going to try that.,thegoaliebear,1
did not work :/,thegoaliebear,1
@Buttkikker did you pick up the quest after you had already reached rank brave tho?,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
aight fam let's get it. in Raid Alpha no rush when everyone is here we'll get it rolling.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I grabbed it as soon as the season dropped,Buttkikker,1
oh so that's probably why.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
Good luck guys! Don't forget to grab the Divinity quest before you start!,RonInDune,1
i progressed to the next pvp step when i was already at heroic II and it never popped retroactively for me. so it's definitely bugged.,thegoaliebear,1
and that really sucks lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Hopefully reset fixes it, otherwise abandon the quest and pick it up again from Drifter",RonInDune,1
yeah but will it reset my progress?,thegoaliebear,1
"It looks like it’s account wide, so I dunno if deleting would reset it",Crizum,1
are we doing the divinity quest? I can grab that if it only takes a sec otherwise I can get for next time,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i believe you have to get it in one go of the raid?,thegoaliebear,1
Unless you can beat the raid you’ll just be wasting time lol,Crizum,1
funnily enough we found some  of the secret rooms on our run,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
How do you get that quest?,the_drake1997,1
ya that's what I thought after watching datto's vid,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"It's fairly easy to do honestly, you can get most of it done in one vex offensive",RonInDune,1
yeah it has to be one go of the raid so...no haha no need to have it yet.,thegoaliebear,1
and are meeting in orbit? i dont see anyone online,the_drake1997,1
i'm on. send a steam friend request.,thegoaliebear,1
doing some misc quest things and I'll join up. stream has started,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
yeah so deleting the quest and reacquiring it didn't work. i'm gonna try and queue into a match and see tho.,thegoaliebear,1
this raid.....maybe not firing?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
totally fine if not. will do some other memes,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
well i know ari said he might be a bit late.,thegoaliebear,1
im good just getting all equips ready 😄,ruGGed_koala,1
"I'll be with y'all shortly, I just have to finish up an email and I'll be on",Peronix,1
also @thegoaliebear what was ur steam?,ruGGed_koala,1
thegoaliebear,thegoaliebear,1
thaaats right,ruGGed_koala,1
I am home and will be online in just a couple minutes,Arixama,1
"I love collector, I feel bad for the enemy team though.",Nahkriin,1
love that for you haha.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear try dc and rc,Arixama,1
@ruGGed_koala @the_drake1997 in Raid Alpha voice channel.,thegoaliebear,1
How goes the raid?,Crizum,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Crizum we got the first two encounters down real easy now. gonna go at it tomorrow and hopefully learn the third and get to the boss.,thegoaliebear,1
"if not, we will have the checkpoint to work on throughout the week!",thegoaliebear,1
Cool,Crizum,1
@Destiny [PC] would people be interested in a Divinity run/final boss learning run this upcoming Saturday? Possibly thinking of starting around daily reset if enough people are down,Crizum,1
"Down to help, but I wouldn't be available until the evening. Although I think you'll definitely have more than enough people, so it shouldn't be a worry",Trissin,1
!lfg create,Crizum,1
"I know there were some people asking around about it, so hopefully",Crizum,1
if i aint busy with school i'd be down,Chance,1
but once the end of october comes ill have a shitload of freetime,Chance,1
so i'd definitely be able to raid by then,Chance,1
yeah i have a game so wouldn't be free until evening time unfortunately.,thegoaliebear,1
@Elite1v41230 in here is where we do all our PC talk aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"10-4 @thegoaliebear , thanks!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
no problem !,thegoaliebear,1
"for those in the raid run tonight (and anyone really), here's a full guide to look at the third and boss encounters. Honestly, as much as we meme about Kackis...i do recommend his video for the last couple encounters he does a real good job explaining it.

@Crizum Is this a KWTD situation?,Lonk,1
Or more Sherpa like,Lonk,1
"I’m 100% good with teaching what I know of the encounters, only real request is light level 930+ for the final encounter",Crizum,1
But even that’s negotiable lol,Crizum,1
"Oof 930. I'm currently 922. Should I stay signed up in hopes i'll make it, or leave my slot open?",Lonk,1
KWTD+minimum 8 clears+must have Gjallarhorn,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune dont forget petras run,CrizMobius,1
"With weekly reset today of all powerfuls, i'm sure i'll grow a lot",Lonk,1
"Reset today so those should put you close, plus drops for the first few encounters should help too",Crizum,1
"Okay cool, i'll stay in the group then. I'm free for that time slot 👌",Lonk,1
Awesome!,Crizum,1
I'll get close to that level by Saturday,LW Mugetsu,1
And @RonInDune you gotta have the Gjallarhorn catalyst too,Crizum,1
Only Ron though,Crizum,1
I've seen a few people say on reddit that the mechanics can be a little much but the raid itself is actually pretty easy going,Lonk,1
so i'm not too worried,Lonk,1
Must have done Zero Hour using Guitar Hero controller only,RonInDune,1
"Yeah the first two encounters are super chill, the third gets a little more hectic but it’s still not terrible. Most issues I’ve seen are people getting killed because of being like 900-910",Crizum,1
Did exotics in D1 have catalysts?,RonInDune,1
No haha,Crizum,1
Innnnteresting,RonInDune,1
i have about an hour before class i am just doing public events for the Undying triumph.,thegoaliebear,1
if the severs hold up lmao nevermind.,thegoaliebear,1
wow can't go 5 seconds without getting contacting servers.,thegoaliebear,1
Are they doing maintenance?,RonInDune,1
there is an update i already updated tho aha.,thegoaliebear,1
maybe i have to log back in.,thegoaliebear,1
Ugh hate it when it runs slow,the_drake1997,1
andddd there's a queue LOL,thegoaliebear,1
nice I thought i would only experience this once this season,CrizMobius,1
hoping they fixed that quest bug aha.,thegoaliebear,1
Quest bug?,CrizMobius,1
hoping they fixed le monarque quest too,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
yeah in the pvp and gambit quests if you reached the rank required on a certain step it wouldn't count it retroactively.,thegoaliebear,1
ah,CrizMobius,1
"so i was at Heroic II valor when I got the next step of ""reach valor rank heroic"" i got to Heroic III and it never checked it off.",thegoaliebear,1
same thing with the gambit ranks.,thegoaliebear,1
It probably doesn’t count sub ranks?,Crizum,1
Try to get the next named rank and see,Crizum,1
i would if the game wasn't unavailable rn hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1

Imagine if they had to rollback the servers 1 week 😄,CrizMobius,1
i think the servers going down was Bungie's way of telling me to study.,thegoaliebear,1
During my time we actually studied before we played games 🤓,CrizMobius,1
That’s literally never been true,Crizum,1
The amount of study was close to 0,CrizMobius,1
haha my 1230 got cancelled so i had so much time after practice. got my work done. but it wasn't enough for bungo 😩,thegoaliebear,1
But we studied before we played games 😉,CrizMobius,1
@thegoaliebear its back up,Arixama,1
30 mins before i have to go haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Crizum Do you agree with this loadout recommendations?
<https://old.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/ddrbh5/garden_of_salvation_guide_and_megathread/>
Cause if so ~~i'll need to hunt for izanagi's~~",Lonk,1
"Yeah those are all solid choices, Izanagi’s cannot be recommended enough and recluse pairs incredibly well. However if you’re at or above the right light level you have some leeway in what you run with",Crizum,1
"A lot of the encounters is ad clearing, so whatever you’re comfortable with",Crizum,1
"i never bothered with izanagis. but if you have whisper and even darci will do nicely. so no need to worry about IB being a ""must have""",thegoaliebear,1
"I got Recluse and MT, but I've been loving Riskrunner lately",Lonk,1
"Yeah the main perk about izanagi is it does massive damage, pairs with recluse, and leaves a spot open for a grenade launcher for the bigger ads",Crizum,1
But for some of the encounters I was running Monte Carlo on sentinel Titan punching everyone for almost 100% overshield uptime,Crizum,1
"@Lonk It's not on that list there, but I'm gonna go ahead and recommend threat level. I found it very helpful for some of the encounters",Trissin,1
Aw man I want monte so bad,Lonk,1
Threat Level + Recluse got me thru lots,Trissin,1
Threat Level over the EP Shotgun?,Lonk,1
"the good thing about the weapon buffs overall is that you can make a lot of things work. there's really no ""oh you must have this to be successful."" sure some weapons make the job easier, but there's a lot of viable stuff out there.",thegoaliebear,1
I'd do threat level yeah. so you can pair recluse with it.,thegoaliebear,1
Recluse is just too strong so it kinda makes it hard to recommend a different weapon in the slot,Crizum,1
"Oh right, same slot",Lonk,1
"Thing is, you can't run EP and recluse together",Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Recluse with anti-barrier rounds in it can also go through the Angelics shields,Crizum,1
yeah...recluse is just too good haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Anti-barrier is busted, you can just chew through hobgoblins even when they go to heal",Crizum,1
i put an overload mod on recluse and anti barrier on breakneck and that pairing did some hella work during the encounters last night.,thegoaliebear,1
"crap, don't have it yet feelsbad",Lonk,1
If you have mountaintop that also works,Crizum,1
"that's fine, there are other good kinetic shotguns",Trissin,1
i think i prefer sg over mt for some encounters,Trissin,1
Oh yeah! The new moon shotgun can roll with one-two punch and you can farm it on the moon,Crizum,1
"||those minotaurs in the second and third encounter chase you around, so with MT you'd blow yourself up a lot||",Trissin,1
"*oof* my #1 enemy is self destruction, lol.",Lonk,1
and #2 is wide pits 😅,Lonk,1
"If you can’t get a scourge in try for one small step, it maybe isn’t the best roll but I have a QuickDraw/1 2 punch roll and I’m liking it",Crizum,1
"@thegoaliebear I like your loadout, because I used that pretty much constantly last season. Minus the mods ofc",Lonk,1
yeah i'll try for a scourge run before saturday,Lonk,1
Go with @RonInDune cause he cursed me to like 4 of those shotguns,Crizum,1
yeah honestly...you can do work with a lot of weapons now haha. but the breakneck/recluse combo serves really well. i also used the moon machine gun and that turned out to be really nice for angelics and mobs in the second encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
breakneck 👀,Trissin,1
"actually, we're all meta slaves. we should break out of the cycle and make a statement",Trissin,1
equip traveler's chosen (damaged),Trissin,1
run sidearms and swords,Trissin,1
Swords in PvE and PvP,RonInDune,1
it's the way to go,Trissin,1
Anyone who says swords are bad gets dabbed on repeatedly,RonInDune,1
(hint hint @Oathbreaker ),RonInDune,1
Gotta kill me first before you can dab on me,Oathbreaker,1
Also,Oathbreaker,1
*SWORDS ARE BAD*,Oathbreaker,1
They're pretty good for Vex Invasion as they constantly stun the bosses,Lonk,1
I'm gonna try and hop on before our raid to rank up in valor and see it that fixes the thing on the pvp quest.,thegoaliebear,1
worldline zero best exotic don't @ me,Trissin,1

THAT CLIP,Oathbreaker,1
swords best,Trissin,1
IS HILARIOUS,Oathbreaker,1
THAT'S SOME TITANFALL TECH,Oathbreaker,1
the right move by bungie tbh. a 24 hr emblem should be a 24 hr emblem regardless of what happens. if they had communicated it prior to the 24 hr period being over then it would have been fine.,thegoaliebear,1
but imagine being a team that cleared it at like 25 hrs and having the emblem snatched back💀😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
I thinkn the main thing is because contest mode was deactivated,Trissin,1
"Teams clearing garden without contest on, and getting the emblem",Trissin,1
that really defeats the significance of having it,Trissin,1
exactly.,thegoaliebear,1
Hmm why have I been kicked from the clan?,CrizMobius,1
you're still on the roster.,thegoaliebear,1
wat destiny says I'm not 😄,CrizMobius,1
wat,CrizMobius,1
could be more wonky stuff going on,thegoaliebear,1
o_O,CrizMobius,1
oh I had to restart destiny,CrizMobius,1
Any fans of bows here? Been running with a bow a lot lately and I’m kind of addicted.  I was going after Le Monarque but the new quest from Ada is busted (legend weapon frames forged aren’t counting towards quest).  Anyone have monarque/use it much?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"I was addicted to whichever the electric bow is last season, rocking that thing a lot",Lonk,1
"monarque is **great**, i love it.",Trissin,1
but this season I haven't really busted them out yet. I will be soon for the Offensive triumph,Lonk,1
😓,Lonk,1
"bows are not really in a good spot, and I don't think I would use them for any competitive activity really",Trissin,1
but they are a lot of fun,Trissin,1
"if you like bows, hush is probably worth the grind
that's a really nice bow",Trissin,1
"I need a bow so bad, don’t have one",GustingWind,1
isn't that the one that's better to not be ads with?,Lonk,1
a 'hip fire' bow,Lonk,1
I remember getting almost destroyed in a comp game with a bow user couple of days ago,RonInDune,1
"@thegoaliebear and @Crizum managed to get the better of them just by rushing and closing the distance immediately, so that's the biggest problem with bows",RonInDune,1
"ty for the tip on hush, i'll  check it out 🙂 and yeah using bows at short range is a bad time...",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"i whip out riskrunner when the gap is closed, usually manage to widen it back fairly quickly",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Jeez @Lonk just how many runs in vex offensive do you have lol,Crizum,1
So many.. so.. so many,Lonk,1
I really want the undying title so I’m grinding those triumphs hard,Lonk,1
@Trissin Trinity ghoul would like to have a word with you,Kit,1
_ew_ Trinity ghoul,Trissin,1
I don't like it,Trissin,1
*gasp*,Kit,1
feels too slow for me,Trissin,1
Isn’t that just risk runner but bad?,Crizum,1
>:C,Kit,1
Leviathans Breath looks interesting,Crizum,1
Like it’s gonna make crucible even more hellish lol,Crizum,1
nice to know it's 500 kills each for that vex offensive triumph lol. i'm almost done with SMGs and Autos.,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear challenging enemies grant bonus progress too, so any yellow or orange bars count for more",Crizum,1
oh nice that's probs why my auto rifle went up so quickly last night. just a couple runs and i'm at like 60% aha.,thegoaliebear,1
:o auto rifle kills,Trissin,1
might be time to pull out that Sweet business,Trissin,1
yayaya.,thegoaliebear,1
Already got the catalyst done too,Trissin,1
It’s pretty nice now,Crizum,1
i just kept breakneck on but i should try SB for the memes.,thegoaliebear,1
"actually, I'll do my Cerberus catalyst",Trissin,1
trinity ghoul would be a good option for getting that triumph in vex offensive tho. Its real good for ad-clear,Kit,1
I used that for getting Hush as well in gambito,Kit,1
neat. i like the Offensive triumphs making me use stuff i normally wouldn't aha. it's been pretty fun.,thegoaliebear,1
"Sweet, got Monte Carlo, also got two wavesplitter drops last night which seemed excessive.",Samakain,1
dang nice,Buttkikker,1
"speaking of bow's, we'll be getting the leviathan's breath quest soon ™",Lonk,1

Oct 22.,thegoaliebear,1
if the steps are true...its very easy haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"yeah I agree, unless the ||strike|| is on ||thorn level|| 😰",Lonk,1
haha yeah i think that is more frustrating than hard per say. a good team will see something like that done in maybe 30-45mins max.,thegoaliebear,1
depends on what the modifiers end up being tho haha.,thegoaliebear,1
can't wait to start making builds around Nightstalker. going full add management haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Anybody wanna run for 100k in Ordeal?,Samakain,1
if only i wasn't in class lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Same for work,Crizum,1
do you have a third?,Matos,1
"btw, I believe you have to run it on the 950 difficulty or higher to score 100k
just letting you know!",Trissin,1
"Yeah, when I ran the 920 we killed everything and finished in about 12 minutes on pyramidion and only hit about 84k",Crizum,1
"Yeah, highest I got on the pyramidion 920 was like 89k.",Trissin,1
"And you can't reset zones by wiping either, it'll just subtract the score you earned",Trissin,1
"Even if you try to get like ability kills as often as you can, there just aren't enough adds to push it over 100k",Trissin,1
sucks that 100k doesn't count for regular nightfalls now as a powerful reward.,thegoaliebear,1
I think that's fair. 100k on regular nightfall was a little too easy,Trissin,1
What's the nightfall this week?,RonInDune,1
It’s the only non-raid thing to get you to 960,Crizum,1
It’s a pinnacle reward so it makes sense,Crizum,1
i believe the ordeal is scarlet keep,Trissin,1
That's what I've heard as well,Oathbreaker,1
the legend/mastery levels should be pinnacle gear but i think a 100k regular could have still given a normal powerful reward maybe cap it at 940 or something.,thegoaliebear,1
Like a tier 1 for doing a five of swords run? Yeah that could have worked,Crizum,1
yeah exactly.,thegoaliebear,1
Honestly feels more doable now that gear isn't locked,RonInDune,1
it just feels weird not doing them now haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Or is it locked on higher levels?,RonInDune,1
ordeal nightfalls lock gear at 950+,Trissin,1
welp,RonInDune,1
bc literally regular nightfalls serve no purpose now aside from if you want to get the NF exclusive item.,thegoaliebear,1
I mean with the direction they're taking the game I don't mind that,Oathbreaker,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
For example,Oathbreaker,1
if you're me,Oathbreaker,1
You'll be found in the Hallowed Lair strike for the next week,Oathbreaker,1
Non-stop,Oathbreaker,1
fucking Mindbenders,Oathbreaker,1
yeah I was about to say I really want the DFA handcannon and the one Sniper rifle I can't remember that's really good for noobs,RonInDune,1
way to easier to actually grind now,RonInDune,1
the long goodbye?,Trissin,1
or silicon neuroma,Trissin,1
The one you get from insight terminus,RonInDune,1
Long Goodbye isn't really a good entry into snipers,Oathbreaker,1
I have good sole survivor with opening shot/snapshot sights that I really like so far,RonInDune,1
"has the weird chevron sight, has an *okay* zoom, not great stats, and chances of getting a good roll aren't great, so you're kinda wasting time farming it instead of something like Beloved, or Twilight Oath, or Supremacy, or even using Alone as a god",Oathbreaker,1
That roll is definitely good,Oathbreaker,1
I don't like Sole Survivor but that roll is just so good,Oathbreaker,1
"not as popular as those you listed, but i like the frigid jackal",Trissin,1
"although I also don't really snipe, so it could just be a me thing",Trissin,1
"Frigid is okay. 45 zoom from what I remember, has Quickdraw too so",Oathbreaker,1
Beloved does feel *very* satisfying to use somehow,RonInDune,1
"Mind you, a LOT of things about sniping is just down to feel",Oathbreaker,1
"I could go home right now, pick up my Twilight Oath and go slay out with it despite not using it for 3-4 months on feel alone",Oathbreaker,1
"My twilight oath was PvE roll I think, with box breathing and something else",RonInDune,1
But the zoom on that felt weird somehow,RonInDune,1
Whereas something like my Supremacy takes a good day or two to get accustomed to it because it feels too lightweight,Oathbreaker,1
"It's 35 zoom, lowest in the game",Oathbreaker,1
i used a box breathing/firmly planted Beloved for my revoker steps. wasn't too bad and now i am forced back into pvp for Undying :))),thegoaliebear,1
"If I have a rampage or kill clip on a sniper, can I bodyshot people?",RonInDune,1
Not on 90rpms,Oathbreaker,1
"On 72s, yes",Oathbreaker,1
"oh actually you know what, that reminds me",Trissin,1
I recently picked up a bow with no distractions and moving target,Trissin,1
"Get good at double kills with scouts goal, cause those steps for randy are stupid",Crizum,1
Tatara is the only one that can roll Kill Clip,Oathbreaker,1
i'm at 54% for scout kills and only like 18% for kills and medals. it's brutal.,thegoaliebear,1
A million percent out of whack with the gambit and vanguard steps and I don’t even understand why lol,Crizum,1
**jade rabbit**,Trissin,1
Jade Rabbit or Polaris Lance,Oathbreaker,1
deadass why did they make the pvp one so ridiculous.,thegoaliebear,1
probably bc they have to get people into the playlists somehow,thegoaliebear,1
😜,thegoaliebear,1
Is it as bad as mountaintop?,RonInDune,1
"I don’t think they communicated the quest well, apparently the best method for medals is cold fusion?",Crizum,1
i will try anything to make that shit go faster lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I mean the people who play pvp on average are gonna go into pvp willingly,Oathbreaker,1
@RonInDune nothing is as bad as mountaintop,Trissin,1
"Also Oath I do have a kill clip Tatara Gaze but I've literally never used it in PvP, might try it out then",RonInDune,1
"Tatara has a shit scope, that's the only thing Ron",Oathbreaker,1
i dont like the zoom of tatara,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Boxy and zoomed WAY in,Oathbreaker,1
im not tryna use a microscope here,Trissin,1
^^^^,Oathbreaker,1
"I kinda feel people don’t like playing PvP, they like stomping in PvP",Crizum,1
Maybe it'll be useful in the new map,RonInDune,1
disagree Crizum,Oathbreaker,1
It’s a subtle difference,Crizum,1
Though scout flinch is brutal,RonInDune,1
@Crizum i like sbmm,Trissin,1
I don't enjoy stomping unless I'm meme'ing with friends,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh I like it now, but it gets bad at the end of the season",Crizum,1
i enjoy getting a crucible quest done so i don't have to play it for the rest of the season.,thegoaliebear,1
See I just enjoy PvP.,Oathbreaker,1
"Cause the amount of six stack mindbenders or NF, dust rock etc you run in to in quickplay was disheartening to learn",Crizum,1
i respect that. i will always think it's hot garbage tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah towards the end of last season I was not having fun anymore, but otherwise I like using weird weapons and trying to have fun",RonInDune,1
"""trying"" key word 😉",thegoaliebear,1
I literally never see a 6 stack anymore lol,Oathbreaker,1
Not saying they don't exist,Oathbreaker,1
really? all the matches i played the other day had at least a 4 stack in them.,thegoaliebear,1
"I’m having more fun this season, but you can’t tell me there isn’t a sizable amount of players who hit their legend rank, get unbroken, and just proceed to pubstomp quickplay instead of doing comp",Crizum,1
Well yeah? There's no incentive to play comp anymore,Oathbreaker,1
Now that classic mix is it’s own thing I’m interested in seeing how it shakes out,Crizum,1
Yeah apparently people got to Unbroken really fast this season,RonInDune,1
I think they tweaked scoring,RonInDune,1
It took 95% of the Sherpas in the PvP improvement Discord I'm in 3 or 4 days to reach legend,Oathbreaker,1
holy cow,RonInDune,1
Right but what’s the incentive to play quickplay over comp? Six stacking pub stomps or just countdown being countdown?,Crizum,1
"The other 5% took another day or two, and the last remaining outlier is me just because I focus on school",Oathbreaker,1
Countdown is gone as a mode,Oathbreaker,1
i don't enjoy pvp. being with at least one other person makes it more tolerable but not by much. i do mildly enjoy stacking in comp when we're getting wins. but otherwise...nah.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh really? Thank god,RonInDune,1
Comp is only 3v3 survival,Oathbreaker,1
I really didn't enjoy countdown,RonInDune,1
like literally nothing will make me enjoy pvp. never did in D1 either.,thegoaliebear,1
"This is all last season I’m talking about mainly, this season so far my only complaint is how frustrating the randys quest is for the Undying title lol",Crizum,1
We should have clan pvp + gambit again,Trissin,1
And before the reason to play QP over Comp was finding matches quicker,Oathbreaker,1
I actually really enjoyed that,Trissin,1
Comp would take 30min+ at times to find a match,Oathbreaker,1
you might enjoy it too @thegoaliebear,Trissin,1
"Yeah I couldn't join in last time, but I'm in for clan night again",RonInDune,1
and i wouldn't mind this scout weapon quest if the medals/kills weren't so ridiculously *not* tuned at all to the other steps.,thegoaliebear,1
^^,RonInDune,1
Bungie may end up tweaking it,Oathbreaker,1
Wait and see if you guys want,Oathbreaker,1
Focus on other stuff,Oathbreaker,1
i mean...it actually is ridiculous.,thegoaliebear,1
Don't burn yourself out,Oathbreaker,1
how many scout kills is it,Trissin,1
"like I said, communicated poorly on the quest. Double kills with scouts give like 100 points for medals?",Crizum,1
yeah literally wtf LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
okay 450 is a bit high,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
goddamn,Trissin,1
Bungie and wording things well? What universe are you guys living in,Oathbreaker,1
if i'm at 54% on scout kills alone...you should probably be around 35-40% for medals/kills if it's tuned properly.,thegoaliebear,1
but it's not.,thegoaliebear,1
so it's awful.,thegoaliebear,1
"Not disagreeing that it's a shit quest, mind you",Oathbreaker,1
For reference here’s Gambit,Crizum,1
lol its like the sunshot catalyst,Trissin,1
get 500 kills with the gun and 1k kills with the ~~sunshot~~ sunblast perk,Trissin,1
Which is actually dumb lmao,Oathbreaker,1
the gambit isn't bad at all and it is a nicely tuned weapon quest tbh. requires a decent enough grind but not too crazy.,thegoaliebear,1
why does it even list 500 kills as a requirement when the ~~sunshot~~ sunblast kills are harder to get and count towards kills anyways,Trissin,1
i only played two matches the other day and already at 80 multikills.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah the tuning is definitely weird,Oathbreaker,1
"It’s just so disheartening to relatively pop off for my skill level, go 30+ kills and see like a 1% increase if I’m lucky",Crizum,1
"and medals aren't hard to come by in gambit or pvp, so it's kind of weird how much more the pvp requires. but then again...bungo.",thegoaliebear,1
^^^,thegoaliebear,1
I got exit strategy already lol,Buttkikker,1
oh crap,Trissin,1
how is it,Trissin,1
its pretty cool,Buttkikker,1
I just got a gold medal for wiping the entire enemy team but it’s worth less than a double kill with fusions? How?,Crizum,1
"Which is understandable, it's a shitty quest to try and grind",Oathbreaker,1
"if they want to keep the 14,000 for medals/kills, then make teammates contribute.",thegoaliebear,1
but how does it _feel_ @Buttkikker,Trissin,1
does it look cool in your hands and sound good when it shoots,Trissin,1
Who knows Crizum? Unless Bungie devs speak out on it we won't know how it tracks exactly,Oathbreaker,1
We can extrapolate some information but we can't say for sure,Oathbreaker,1
also *several people are typing*,Oathbreaker,1
"lol @Buttkikker is literally the fastest to pinnacle weapons everytime, congrats dude!",RonInDune,1
"From my searching all I can find it double kills give more progress, scout doubles the most, but you have to be the final blow on each kill but it’s all theory",Crizum,1
i just found it funny that *of course* the pvp weapon turned out to be the grindy-est,thegoaliebear,1
Im a big fan so far feels nice and it's got swashbuckler which is nice,Buttkikker,1
the only downside is its slowish reload time,Buttkikker,1
is it kinetic or energy? can't remember.,thegoaliebear,1
but to be fair ive been using outlaw on the vex invasion smg,Buttkikker,1
kinetic,Buttkikker,1
ooh...i like to see it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
it seems really good based on the stats,Trissin,1
and the perks,Trissin,1
almost like a ~~primary~~ kinetic recluse,Trissin,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
the only reason i went with swashbuckler is the overload mod,Buttkikker,1
honestly yeah i am going to break from the pvp weapon for a bit and just get the gambit and vanguard weapons aha.,thegoaliebear,1
otherwise surrounded/surrounded spec would be the way to go i think,Buttkikker,1
"^
thats what I was thinking,yeah",Trissin,1
though i cant decide between threat detector and underdog,Buttkikker,1
i'm about 55% overall done with Edgewise so...that's not too bad and exit strategy will definitely go quick.,thegoaliebear,1
Threat detector gives reload speed right?,Crizum,1
i would probably go threat detector,Trissin,1
yeah but so does underdog,Buttkikker,1
unless you find yourself in those risky situations often,Trissin,1
i guess it depends on playstyle,Trissin,1
Threat detector procs more at the range you’d use the smg in PvE I feel,Crizum,1
i think with the melee incentive of swashbuckler underdog might be the way to go but again not sure,Buttkikker,1
"Threat Detector has more uptime in comparison to Underdog, especially with an SMG. You want to get close but you really don't want to be low health in PvE so",Oathbreaker,1
That's my take on it at least,Oathbreaker,1
Using Ophidian Aspect with enhanced smg loader on a swashbuckler smg is very very good,RonInDune,1
Especially on a devour warlock,RonInDune,1
yeah that would be kinda ridiculous,Buttkikker,1
you can literally never die,RonInDune,1
When I don’t have to use a scout I may try an exit strategy/recluse/peacekeepers build for a bit,Crizum,1
Just be zoomie,Crizum,1
and with devour threat detector would be better no doubt,Buttkikker,1
yup devour is always so good,RonInDune,1
I've 1v4ed in comp last season while running devour and it was broken,RonInDune,1
"I lost for sure, but I lost gloriously",RonInDune,1
Devour is great if you can chain the kills,Oathbreaker,1
Unfortunately the rest of the subclass is ass for PvP,Oathbreaker,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
yeah that's true,RonInDune,1
wait @Crizum i just looked on braytech at the pvp quest and it says 2/3 for Heroic rank earned. so i think you're correct about having to reach the next valor rank for it to count maybe.,thegoaliebear,1
but it doesn't have the same deal for the gambit Brave rank.,thegoaliebear,1
For the second shader?,Crizum,1
the emblem for pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oh yeah, it may cause I’m on the quest before it and I am listed at 2 for valor rank heroic",Crizum,1
So they probably mean whatever rank is after heroic,Crizum,1
Burnished Blade it says 2/3 Valor rank Heroic earned. so yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
just weird it doesn't show that way on the gambit one.,thegoaliebear,1
i will have to rank that one up to the next group too and see if it works.,thegoaliebear,1
"but for Edgewise it's 1,000 machine gun kills so loading into a nightfall solo and farming lost sectors probably works well.",thegoaliebear,1
is edgewise any good though?,Trissin,1
idk but i need it for Undying so i gotta.,thegoaliebear,1
like would you use it over hammerhead/delirium?,Trissin,1
ohh,Trissin,1
ok,Trissin,1
my guess is probably not haha. but it is nice to probably keep since it's solar.,thegoaliebear,1
i know Fixed Odds is solar as well but i will have to see how Edgewise handles compared.,thegoaliebear,1
oh hell,Oathbreaker,1
it looks to be an objectively worse 21%,Buttkikker,1
"i completely forgot about fixed odds, immediately thought of avalanche lol",Trissin,1
||Raid sniper is a 140rpm with No Distractions/Snapshot on a 40 zoom scope||,Oathbreaker,1
"hmmm actually @Buttkikker idk, it seems like it might actually be pretty good",Trissin,1
^^ GoS gear spoiler just in case someone is curious,Oathbreaker,1
speaking of fixed odds. i should grab that from menagerie and use it for edgewise steps haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"same rpm, smaller mag, and rampage seems like worse killing tally",Buttkikker,1
"yeah, i've been using avalanche lol",Trissin,1
im thinking about demolitionist and field prep,Trissin,1
for infinite grenades,Trissin,1
"not infinite, but like a **lot**",Trissin,1
personally id prefer demo on a primary,Buttkikker,1
more uptime on the gun,Buttkikker,1
thats fair,Trissin,1
so edgewise also has light mag on it.,thegoaliebear,1
which is nice.,thegoaliebear,1
tho im not sure if its the same amount of grenade regen,Buttkikker,1
will probably be something to use for fun in vex offensive or something.,thegoaliebear,1
Get an Austringer with Demolitionist if you really want a demolitionist primary,Oathbreaker,1
no kidding,Buttkikker,1
though tbh ive been in love with smgs lately,Buttkikker,1
i love dropping a fat tether and then running and gunning with recluse. been having a blast in vex offensive and menagerie with that. was also fun in that second raid encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
Did they tweak tether a bit? It seems to be more reliable now,RonInDune,1
i am not sure i'll have to look at the patch notes for shadowkeep again.,thegoaliebear,1
i will have to try bottom tree out in team activities especially vex offensive. seems like nice buffs/changes.,thegoaliebear,1
You like arc in PvP right?,Crizum,1
Go be a bully and use the overshield on arc abilities mod from the gate eye with that helmet that heals you when you dodge,Crizum,1
Striker titans can combine it with the rally barricade and oem to always have shields,Crizum,1
Season engam reward!,Lonk,1
Nice!!!,RonInDune,1
congrats,Buttkikker,1
i've only been seeing they've been getting duplicate armor,Lonk,1

Some of the new shaders are dope,RonInDune,1
Some of the newer stuff in r/DestinyFashion look gorgeous,RonInDune,1

yeah you can just send a request to the PC clan whenever you'd like if you'll be playing primarily/exclusively on PC now.,thegoaliebear,1
"I can send the request while in ps4 clan, or I need to leave and have no clan, then send request?",Lonk,1
leave  and then join,Arixama,1

So I dunno if there will be enouch people available to form a second rn,Trissin,1
all good i found an lfg,Spitfire2266,1
but I think Crizum's in the process of forming a team this saturday on reset,Trissin,1
cool,Spitfire2266,1
👌,Trissin,1
Season pass machine gun is kinda nutty,Crizum,1
"Hey, anyone wanna do a raid? The last wish?",Rox,1
Omg so many raiders in our clan now! great!,Trissin,1
If we had 6 for last wish I wouldn't mind a run through,RonInDune,1
"Nice, so tihs makes 3 anyone else wanna get in on this?",Rox,1
"Oh no, sorry @Rox but I'm not available to raid tonight",Trissin,1
I'm just glad there are so many people who here who want to do the raids,Trissin,1
"Understandable. I'm just trying to find some people to play with. Not just the raids but PVP, PVE and Gambit as well.",Rox,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
That mainly for the people from tonight?,Crizum,1
yeah but i don't think someone will be able to make it so we will need a sixth.,thegoaliebear,1
I’ll join up but if they show I can step out lol,Crizum,1
haha awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone  gonna do some Gambit or Crucible?,Rox,1
i am currently making progress on Vex Offensive triumphs.,thegoaliebear,1
"Damn, haven't gotton to the moon yet. Kinda playing through the campaigns one at a time. Just got done with osiris.",Rox,1
"nice! don't push yourself too quickly, I find the campaign gets quite repetitive and boring if you just speedrun those missions one after the other",Trissin,1
"Yeah, i'm having a blast with PVP and Gambit.",Rox,1
"Quick question, where is Hawthorne?",Rox,1
She should be in the tower at the bazaar,Trissin,1
just finished the raid guys so excited to get my raid jacket,Spitfire2266,1
group i was with was so calm and collected took us just over an hour. gotta love that first time you beat a new raid,Spitfire2266,1
nice!! congrats!,Trissin,1
final boss took us 4 tries we had a 960 with us that really helped with all the chaos,Spitfire2266,1
"@Trissin  thanks, found her. She legit wasn't there before.",Rox,1
"damn, only 4 tries? that's real impressive",Trissin,1
"glad to hear ur run went smoothly, it's always nice raiding with an organized group",Trissin,1
for sure,Spitfire2266,1
2nd encounter only took us 1 try that was awesome,Spitfire2266,1
Nice,Crizum,1
on my day 1 2nd encounter took 6 hours,Spitfire2266,1
"lool yeah it was pretty hectic, i think my team spent a good like 3 or 4 hours on it as well",Trissin,1
is it just me or does it feel like the regular nightfall scales up to your light level,Chance,1
i tried doing hollowed lair 2 man and it was surprisingly difficult even though its 820 recommended and we are both 925,Chance,1

Mods for armor 2.0,Trissin,1
Pinned a message.,Arixama,1
73% for solar kills and 52% for machine gun kills and i will be done with Edgewise lol.,thegoaliebear,1
still at 60% on void/grenade kill for the first shader tho. that one is more of a grind.,thegoaliebear,1
oh but @Spitfire2266 congrats on the raid completion that's awesome!,thegoaliebear,1
Hmm. I can't join :(,Kit,1
Did you `!register` ?,Trissin,1
Yeap.,Kit,1
I had to re register after Steam,Trissin,1
He's working in another server.. Wont even reply to my search command here,Kit,1
!lfg search raid,Kit,1
!lfg search,Kit,1
!lfg search,Crizum,1
:idk:,Kit,1
love that. if you'd like to join for sure tonight I'll remember tho aha @Kit,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, I signed up. @Ransom  too",Kit,1
!lfg join 671 @Kit,thegoaliebear,1
yeah guess warmind doesn't wanna cooperate rn.,thegoaliebear,1
Haha,Crizum,1
but I'll remember you two are in. so I'll just @ you when we're all getting together.,thegoaliebear,1
A'ite.,Kit,1
I’ll be running Titan tonight and likely Hunter Saturday unless something happens with my warlock,Crizum,1
Always warlock for me :),Kit,1
Last night I screwed over a hunter so bad I had to laugh about it,Crizum,1
Activated ward of dawn and the second I hit the third person view I see them jump for the tether,Crizum,1
cool. we had the mechanics down clearly and got to damage phase several times. but we just had some issues with our boss team getting across those jumping puzzles sometimes and had too many deaths.,thegoaliebear,1
I’m good on gambit team or eyes,Crizum,1
Across the jumping puzzle? You mean the part where you pick up his voltaic and shoot the eyes?,Kit,1
yeah,thegoaliebear,1
Gotcha,Kit,1
the jumping area with the rotating platforms gave them trouble,thegoaliebear,1
Hm. I don't remember seeing a part with rotating platforms. I'll have to re-watch the video,Kit,1
The copper cylinder area,Crizum,1
yeah from the trailer,Kit,1
I just don't recall seeing it during that fight,Kit,1
Ahh,Crizum,1
we were efficient with the motes tho. we did 5-10-10-5 and that worked out well for us as far as speed went. if we didn't have the deaths we could have gotten it bc a couple damage phases it was only the motes team at the beacon for it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
lmaooo okay warmind.,thegoaliebear,1
Go home Warmind you’re drunk,Crizum,1
Looks like he caught up,Kit,1
love to see that.,thegoaliebear,1
Someone photoshop rasputin on slowpokes face,Crizum,1
"also, we need to rename the raid LFG to Vault of Grass",Kit,1
no longer GoS,Kit,1
this is true.,thegoaliebear,1
How were you guys taking down the eyes in the detained part?,Kit,1
Just letting the detained take them out with a sniper?,Kit,1
we had one person on the left and right of detained person. detained calls out inner or outer and each person shoots their eye.,thegoaliebear,1
I was watching some peeps 3 man it and he just popped the 3 reds with a snip,Kit,1
1 shot per eye,Kit,1
"That’s how I’ve been doing if, or if people can’t make it in time snipe it",Crizum,1
if each person in the boss team tonight feels comfortable doing that then for sure can go that method.,thegoaliebear,1
we will most likely be quick enough with the motes as well so we won't have to swap someone to pick up a 4th voltaic.,thegoaliebear,1
Biggest killer in my runs has been those stupid supplicants,Crizum,1
yeah we had some deaths to those as well. I think we just have to remember to keep on the pillars and jumping around aha.,thegoaliebear,1
Oki i re-watched the vid. I see the twirly part now lol,Kit,1
Just on the way to get the voltaic,Kit,1
Anywho I'm gucci with whatever role ya wanna toss me in.,Kit,1
"goal and i were on mote team, but i had to sub into grab a voltaic a couple times. was able to pop at least 2 with recluse.",Arixama,1
yeah i think if we can eliminate deaths on voltaic team we won't have to swap in. we were prettt quick getting the motes in.,thegoaliebear,1
I might try DARCI for damage as well. see how it compares to whisper,thegoaliebear,1
Izanagi did work in boss phase for me,Crizum,1
Im thinking DARCI,Kit,1
SHAXX MAKES SCORCH CANNON EXPLOSION SOUND EFFECTS,Arixama,1
whisper did good damage but it was way too inconsistent getting that reload back.,thegoaliebear,1
DARCI has more bullets to fire and being on hunter can just auto reload dodge,thegoaliebear,1
it hits freakin hard too,Kit,1
I think the speed of the shots should help get damage out quickly,Kit,1
I would recommend izanagi,Trissin,1
yeah for sure. i like how it handles a bit more too. so...definitely gonna infuse that up haha.,thegoaliebear,1
That's what my group used for encounter 3 on day 1,Trissin,1
for the most part,Trissin,1
"did better damage than whisper, darci, etc",Trissin,1
"Trissin, you need to remember that i nearly quit the game during black armory.",thegoaliebear,1
due to the 1KV bullshit rng.,thegoaliebear,1
I was gonna say why not both? But remembered that it's both exotic,Kit,1
Worship at the church of the weeb weapon,Crizum,1
then probably darci yeah,Trissin,1
My sole problem with Izanagi is totally a me thing but I usually run mountaintop for add clear and sometimes I’ll switch to that slot and waste a honed edge x5,Crizum,1
and after i found out you need to do rare BA bounties for izanagis which also require rng i was just like yeah I'm never gonna do that.,thegoaliebear,1
okay so hold tf up,Trissin,1
rare bounties are not actually rng from what I heard,Trissin,1
They drop from turning in her normal bounties,Kit,1
Idk if its RNG or based on how many you turn in,Kit,1
they drop from turning in something like 25 or 30 of her normal bounties in a single week,Trissin,1
but it's a set number,Trissin,1
of dailies,Trissin,1
Theres no way its that much,Kit,1
turned in a week,Trissin,1
that's almost worse,Buttkikker,1
if its that many,Buttkikker,1
LOL,Trissin,1
I've never done more than the required 8 bounties for her weekly,Kit,1
yeah...still won't do it haha. I'm not worried about old content at this stage. been doing just fine without that.,thegoaliebear,1
And it dropped for me still,Kit,1
"It could be that it’s a random chance that gets higher the more you turn in, capping at like 25-30",Crizum,1
Oi at least you can also do shattered throne all the time now too lol. My clan mate finally got the bounty to drop the night before reset on full curse week,Kit,1
"Yeah, you're probably right @Crizum  - that makes the most sense",Trissin,1
"that's not too bad, but also the CoS stats show avg full run to be 1hr12min.. and that's vastly under what it took our team lol",Lonk,1
More stats broken down by weapons used and checkpoints <https://warmind.io/analytics/raid/garden-of-salvation>,Lonk,1
"You’d be surprised, I’ve been in terrible runs that take hours",Crizum,1
"A MT, Recluse, Wendingo wambocombo",Lonk,1
But also vault of grass isn’t terrible to run,Crizum,1
"I'm surprised Riskrunner is 1%, I saw so many streamers using it opening day I figured that would influence it's usage higher",Lonk,1
"I think they used it cause they were underleveled and the arc resistance was super helpful at that level, and less so once tips and tricks were found out",Crizum,1
:travelergoogly:,Lonk,1
i think riskrunner would be really good especially as you start making builds around subclass elements.,thegoaliebear,1
man...i am gonna get my work done so quick tonight so i can grind out more for edgewise lol. getting so close.,thegoaliebear,1
"reminder, what's edgewise?",Lonk,1
vanguard ritual weapon. machine gun,thegoaliebear,1
Ohhhh right,Lonk,1
~~haven't started~~,Lonk,1
it's not too bad. I'm almost done with it.,thegoaliebear,1
"*cough* 👀 
<https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dch9cr/edgewise_is_not_a_good_machine_gun/f2862nw/>",Lonk,1
That makes me sad since I don't have 21% either,Lonk,1
Idk I think it's gonna be good,Trissin,1
mmm 21% is great tho. IMO anyway.,Kit,1
A 900 rpm mg with demolitionist,Trissin,1
I think thats strong,Trissin,1
I'll have to try it out and compare to 21%,thegoaliebear,1
i just loaded into insight terminus nightfall and farming the artifacts edge lost sector.,thegoaliebear,1
wait wat,Kit,1
for edgewise,thegoaliebear,1
Edgewise comes with rampage.. not demolitionist,Kit,1
Or is it selectable?,Kit,1
"Comes with both, and you choose",Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Ah ok lol,Kit,1
"I dunno tho, that overflow perk on 21% is so gucci",Kit,1
Ohhh I only need 40 more primeval kills for 21%,Lonk,1
getting over 200 rounds in the mag is so nice,Kit,1
that's true lol,Trissin,1
and no loading when picking up ammo,Kit,1
i just like that it's solar.,thegoaliebear,1
i used to have a god roll bane of sorrow that i accidentally dismantled,Trissin,1
Is there a 900 rpm void that isn’t temporal clause?,Crizum,1
i don't think so. there really aren't a whole lot of machine guns in the game lol. so tbh I'm glad Edgewise is there to at least add some more diversity to the weapon class.,thegoaliebear,1
also i do have a hard stop around 1030 for the raid tonight. gotta be up hella early tomorrow💀,thegoaliebear,1
Uhhhhhhhhh soooo no room for tonight? Awkward,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i don't remember you saying you'd be available? maybe i confused with someone else?,thegoaliebear,1
I was pushing for 8 and we compromised at 8:30....i can’t do weekend,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"So ya, hate to do this but anyone who signed up for tonight who was not part of the run-through earlier, would love to switch out as I didn't realize we'd have an lfg and was working so could not sign up. Also not available this weekend, so I'd like to get these encounters done with this group.",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
@Crizum @Kit ^ if one of you wouldn't mind. my mistake as i had confused the people who wouldn't be able to make it tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah that’s fine, said I would when I joined haha, just let me know if anyone else doesn’t show up",Crizum,1

!lfg search,Crizum,1
gl to you saturday,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"I’ll probably be braving lfg for a clear, Saturday is Divinity with the clan haha",Crizum,1
ooo divinity. I need to do that too,Kit,1
"I think there are still some spots, when I search lfg it isn’t showing though",Crizum,1
"also thanks, Criz. Just got home and saw this.",Kit,1
!lfg search,Crizum,1
click the arrow,Kit,1
"Ah yeah there we go, still a spot for Saturday",Crizum,1
i would join but unfortunately i have a 3pm game.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'd join, but tis in the middle of the day. Prolly gonna be skateboarding. Its supposed to be really nice out this weekend",Kit,1
If there's one later in the day/evening i'll join up,Kit,1
done!,thegoaliebear,1
niiiice,Arixama,1
look at this guys name omgggg,thegoaliebear,1
OH MY GOD THATS FUCKING HILARIOUS!!!!!!,the_drake1997,1
"So, I've been unable to play Destiny since just before the Raid launch. Is anyone available to show me what's new/play a little crucible (since it's apparently the best way to raise light)?",Thawxtem,1
Anyone wanna help my cousin and i get the whisper of the worm real quick?,link270,1
"@link270 I'm no longer in the clan, but I'd be more than happy to. Add the following friend code on steam: 107833059",Oathbreaker,1

"Okay, is Vex offensive broken or something? It won't let me launch even after having Ikora's quest",Thawxtem,1
Do I need to kill vex for her elsewhere?,Thawxtem,1
Yeah any Vex I think,RonInDune,1
Did you do the mission for it first?,Infernosi,1
have it all figured out thanks to Ari,Thawxtem,1
"damn, just got anteater on my last game before fabled.",Nahkriin,1
finally got recluse,Nahkriin,1
Congrats!,Infernosi,1
thanks!,Nahkriin,1
welcome to the meta slaves brother,Chance,1
Looking to do a 100k nightfall maybe around 3-5 est today if anyone is interested,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"@thegoaliebear @Peronix @Arixama @Crizum @Buttkikker 
For tonight's run - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uQbsLr5vn0",Kit,1
"Clutched out a clear at 2am , that fight has the possibility to get real hectic",Crizum,1
Nice!,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i don't think it'll be that hard. if we all watch the video and are on the same page I'm sure we'll be able to crank it out tonight. i also don't have pregame skate tomorrow morning so now i can stay up later if needed.,thegoaliebear,1
but I'll be getting on right after class pretty much to do some milestones and hopefully gain some extra levels.,thegoaliebear,1
"All people have to do is their role, and they have to avoid “helping”",Crizum,1
"It’s not helping to pre-shoot ||tethers, because I’m trying to bank motes and kill shields, oh thanks now I can’t shoot and get to watch helplessly as goblins steal motes||",Crizum,1
yeah and if we want once people watch the fight we can see if people would be more comfortable doing certain roles. like last night our two teams in the third encounter we got really comfortable and flowed real well in our roles.,thegoaliebear,1
"It’ll be way easier with a group that communicates lol, the win I got was because someone calm joined and talked everything through",Crizum,1
well we definitely have a chill group haha. so i don't think we'll run into any trouble as far as communication goes.,thegoaliebear,1
will just be more of people getting used to the mechanics and flow of the encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
just reposting this here as well.,thegoaliebear,1
Pinned a message.,thegoaliebear,1
so technically by November 19 you can have Undying😄,thegoaliebear,1
Oh god I think I’d rather have had flawless be one of the requirements for Enlightened over what we have in phase 4,Crizum,1
uhhh yeah LOL,thegoaliebear,1
||kill 20 vex with the platforms you build||,Crizum,1
the triumphs for that title are all kinds of wacky doodle,thegoaliebear,1
Also ||anyone with motes can’t kill things|| in third phase,Crizum,1
tomorrow morning I will be grinding the hell out of vex offensive tho.,thegoaliebear,1
It’ll be Sunday or next week for me,Crizum,1
i literally have so much shit going on now that we basically have games every weekend and those literally take up my entire saturdays and half of fridays and i hate it so much lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
so I'm trying to get as much progress on those titles and cosmetic stuff as possible early on bc it only gets worse for me after like...a couple weekends from now.,thegoaliebear,1
"If any of yall have to dip out tonight I’ll be on late. If anyone stays up late and you all get a nice finish and wanna play vex incursions or strikes, lemme know.",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Right now im gonna do some gambit and strikes. If anyone would like to join lemme know. Ill be on in a bit,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I haven't had any oppurtunity to play at all this week so I'm sad,RonInDune,1
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) if you want you can swap in for me, I got the clear and trying to build a group Saturday so I don’t mind",Crizum,1
@Crizum ill be at a concert tonight til 11 or midnight est,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"protip, just like solstice empty swords of the correct energy type count for the melee ability kills",Arixama,1
Ah okay I read that wrong,Crizum,1
All you fam. Just giving the shoutout if it goes later or if ppl want the clear on other characters after that run i have a checkpoint,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I blame it on the three hours of sleep,Crizum,1
Yeah Ari apparently melee based supers also count,Crizum,1
Oh hey they shipped Grimoire Volume II,RonInDune,1
okay...which gpu should i invest in: 2070 Super or 5700XT? I've heard the 5700 is pretty on par with the 2070 super and for considerably less money.,thegoaliebear,1
2070 super is clean for me but maybe benchmarks have 5700xt on par,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I'll have to check out benchmarks again. i don't wanna spend more money especially since ray tracing is like...useless as far as basically everyone is concerned lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
but if i can pick up a 2070 super on a nice sale down the road then I'll go with that one. keeping an eye on the market in the meantime tho until I'm ready to buy.,thegoaliebear,1
Might as well go with the 2080 super over the 2070 super,Kit,1
it's like 50-100$ more,Kit,1
Relatively nice performance increase,Kit,1
"And if you want, you can get a hybrid watercooled from EVGA",Kit,1
i don't want water anywhere near my pc lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
*Shrug*,Kit,1
air cooling hoe right here.,thegoaliebear,1
Both my CPU and my GPU are watercooled lol,Kit,1
But I'm running a mini-itx case so I don't have too much choice if I want it to stay cool,Kit,1
"i've never setup water cooling in all my pc builds, is it particularly difficult? any maintence for them long term?",Lonk,1
i also have a 1700X so idk if a 2080 would bottleneck that.,thegoaliebear,1
but i know for a fact a 2070 won't.,thegoaliebear,1
Custom loop watercooling is a PITA,Kit,1
I like AIO solutions,Kit,1
>> custom,Lonk,1
😅,Lonk,1
pre-made kits plz,Lonk,1
Corsair / NZXT stuff has been around for quite awhile and works very well,Kit,1
i enjoy my absolute unit of a cooler.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I ain’t got room for all that lol. I really prefer small stuff,Kit,1
but i do also have a mid size build so really no need for me to spend extra money on AIO stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
Me and my fiancé’s comps,Kit,1
lil things,Kit,1
damn those are some compact cases haha.,thegoaliebear,1
yeap,Kit,1
but no compromise on specs,Kit,1
this is my set up at college.,thegoaliebear,1
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07N882Z9R/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 <-- the GPU i got my fiance,Kit,1
I'm running the 2080ti hybrid,Kit,1
yeh see i don't have money lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
which is why i say 2070 super. 2080 is really out of the question and I...dont really need it all things considered.,thegoaliebear,1
i like the looks of that case from the little there is haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Hmm. Yeah I guess. The 2070 super seems to be ranging between 500-600$,Kit,1
@Lonk looks like a nzxt case?,Kit,1
both my pc's have https://www.nzxt.com/products/h510i-matte-white,Lonk,1
yep,Lonk,1
yayaya love the nzxt cases.,thegoaliebear,1
i also go to microcenter to buy my stuff and they usually have awesome deals.,thegoaliebear,1
Gosh I hate that store. But they got pretty much everything,Kit,1
lmao it's the best.,thegoaliebear,1
"no microcenter in FL, but I always am jealous when I see their deals on /r/buildapcsales",Lonk,1
Yeah they had a nice deal on my Ti.. think it was like 150 or 200$ off and then 70$ rebate,Kit,1
yeah i live in central FL but at college there's one in cleveland which is only like a 3 hour drive from me.,thegoaliebear,1
ayeee,Lonk,1
i saved about $350 on my set up buying everything from there.,thegoaliebear,1
as opposed to ordering off Amazon.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Lonk but to answer your question from earlier, there really isnt any maintenance. You attach it like most other stuff and mount the radiator on the case",Kit,1
I've got the NZXT Kraken M22 on my cpu,Kit,1
"and it just keeps using the same liquid, you don't have to clean it out?",Lonk,1
Yeah,Kit,1
Its closed,Kit,1
and when you go water cooled you don't hookup any fans?,Lonk,1
no fan on the cpu. the fans are on the radiator,Kit,1
aside from the radiator,Lonk,1
"like case fans, ect",Lonk,1
https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JF6NDC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s03?ie=UTF8&psc=1,Kit,1
You just attach that little pump onto the cpu,Kit,1
i think my nzxt case has 4 lol,Lonk,1
that's it?!,Lonk,1
i've seen build pics of people with tubes going all throughout their system,Lonk,1
thats custom loop crap,Kit,1
"dangerous, expensive, and a pain in the ass",Kit,1
have to clean out the tubes and replace the water every couple months,Kit,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
ah so that's where my confusion was coming from,Lonk,1
"sheeeet, this kraken looks nice. I might switch",Lonk,1
Yeh it's awesome,Kit,1
the pump is all customizable and such as per the usual,Kit,1
got that RGB,Kit,1
makes the GPU faster you know,Kit,1
I use this currently https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/coolers/cpu-air-coolers/hyper-212-evo/,Lonk,1
i have that one but in black.,thegoaliebear,1
https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Hybrid-Graphics-11G-P4-2384-KR/dp/B07MGZJP77 This is my GPU. Has a fan but also watercooled,Kit,1
honestly it's fantastic. my cpu stays hella cool.,thegoaliebear,1
"Lol, yeah i'm missing some frames cause of my lacking rgb",Lonk,1
"One radiator at the bottom of the case, the CPU radiator at the top",Kit,1
I think my CPU maxes out around 55 degrees. GPU under full load is low 60's,Kit,1
"yeah, I've been real busy too @RonInDune . I tried for the day one on sat but that was all I've played this week",Trissin,1
same tho.,thegoaliebear,1
I idle at around 48,Lonk,1
Haven't even cleared yet lol,Trissin,1
my cpu idles around 25-28. under load have never gone above 55. gpu idles around 30 and same under load haven't gone above 63 is the highest I've seen.,thegoaliebear,1
dangggg,Lonk,1
that's nice,Lonk,1
same cooler and you're getting half,Lonk,1
No idea what my idle is. Tbh I stopped paying attention after I got the cooling in the case figured out,Kit,1
but i have an i7-7700,Lonk,1
2old,Lonk,1
i just leave cputemp running in tray all the time 🤷,Lonk,1
i mean still a solid CPU. i have a 1700X so certainly not the newest by any means either haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"cpu temp, cpu load, and ram usage %'s",Lonk,1
but i wanted those crispy 8 cores 😩,thegoaliebear,1
haha,Lonk,1
I've always been an intel/nvidia guy.. Have always been swayed away by the instability issues with AMD,Kit,1
^,Lonk,1
I remember D2 peeps were pretty much unable to play for a good while cuz of issues with amd,Kit,1
bleh 😜,thegoaliebear,1
no issues here.,thegoaliebear,1
i do prefer nvidia gpus tho. but considering i also use my pc for work related programs and whatnot i ain't even look intels way.,thegoaliebear,1
8 core gang @thegoaliebear,Kit,1
i7-9700k meself,Kit,1
intel was just...way too overpriced for me considering the very marginal difference in performance I'd be getting for what i use my pc for.,thegoaliebear,1
~~my mistake was not getting the k model~~,Lonk,1
Still about the stability/compatibility issue for me..,Kit,1
didn't intel announce recently the next wave will be significantly cheaper?,Lonk,1
I'd rather pay the extra 50 bucks or whatever and know that likely anything I throw at it wont have problems :(,Kit,1
yeah bc AMD knocked them out @Lonk 😜,thegoaliebear,1
🤣,Lonk,1
I've always ran amd and never had comparability issues,LW Mugetsu,1
"Yeh, many dont have issues",Kit,1
but its certainly not an undocumented issue,Kit,1
if you *only* game on your pc...then yeah intel is probs better. but otherwise AMD for life fam.,thegoaliebear,1
"Either way, it dun matter. its all personal preference",Kit,1
make use of all those cores/threads. i love it.,thegoaliebear,1
aw shit its starbucks time,Kit,1
text me ur orders <3,Kit,1
caramel frap please 😜😩,thegoaliebear,1
damn that's what i like,Lonk,1
but add salted to it ☑,Lonk,1
yessss,thegoaliebear,1
"when they got that seasonal salt in stock, Mmmmm",Lonk,1
ill mail it to you,Kit,1
u have t in like,Kit,1
2 days,Kit,1
USPS,Kit,1
Nitro cold brew with pumpkin spice and almond milk plz,Crizum,1
😅,Lonk,1
Lol ok brb,Kit,1
"i had the ""cloud"" several times. not sure if they still have it.",thegoaliebear,1
but it was great.,thegoaliebear,1
i had that,Lonk,1
*once*,Lonk,1
and i was stuck on the porceline throne all night,Lonk,1
hahaha,thegoaliebear,1
it was surprisingly good.,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] alright this is a sanity check for myself: are other warlocks getting TITAN gear from Reckoning wagers?,rozak,1
"Oh yeah, that's a bug going on right now. Not just you",Trissin,1
Thanks Bungo,rozak,1
What tier reckoning are you doing?,Trissin,1
I’ve tried every tier just for my own sanity but I farm 3 anyway,rozak,1
All tiers give Titan gear to warlocks,rozak,1
"Wow, okay",Trissin,1
It sucks pretty bad but I guess it’s an easy way to gear a Titan to your warlock’s light,rozak,1
Game is just telling you to cast fist instead of tickle fingers :punjiKappakan:,Gimmie2,1
:up:,Kit,1
You never have to reload a fist,Crizum,1
Ugh. That just reminds me of how warlock melee is slower/less range than both other classes,Kit,1
So frustrating,Kit,1
not even that bug could get me to play reckoning LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
so finding and feeding all the bunnies on the moon is a triumph needed for Harbinger LOL...in case anyone is going for that title.,thegoaliebear,1
argh,Kit,1
ive gotten 1 rice cake so far >:C,Kit,1
i think i have 3...wish i could send them to you haha.,thegoaliebear,1
*now accepting rice cakes*,Kit,1
"Rice and cakes don't go together at, y'all are heathens",RonInDune,1
You’ve never heard of mochi?,Crizum,1
:vomit:,Kit,1
the bunnies enjoy them.,thegoaliebear,1
that's all that matters.,thegoaliebear,1
mochi?,RonInDune,1
Japanese rice cakes,Crizum,1
https://tenor.com/view/mochi-kinako-japanese-desserts-desserts-gif-10250527,Kit,1
Usually filled with various flavors. Ranging from red bean paste to melon,Crizum,1
Pretty popular in hawaii too,Crizum,1
:unacceptable:,Kit,1
Just a cute little reference to the lunar rabbit is all >_>,Crizum,1
I just dislike mochi lol,Kit,1
"My wife is the same, doesn’t enjoy the texture",Crizum,1
Yeah. That texture is super popular there tho,Kit,1
blek,Kit,1
"Interesting, I've never heard of mochi before",RonInDune,1
I'll see if there's any shop with it here in Houston,RonInDune,1
Oi,Kit,1
I'm also in houston,Kit,1
you can find it all over,Kit,1
cool cool,RonInDune,1
Here you go Ron https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tmSrULDVRPc,Crizum,1
"If you don't yell, its not real mochi",Kit,1
lol that is hilarious,RonInDune,1
I genuinely thought that was a parody at first,RonInDune,1

:kk:,Kit,1
So when do you guys reckon Bungie will try actual crossplay? Maybe not on the PvP side but PvE only,RonInDune,1
They've talked about it,RonInDune,1
https://www.latlmes.com/tech/bungie-talks-about-problems-with-crossplay-1,RonInDune,1
Once everyone agree's with it I guess,Kit,1
I think in terms of PvE it could be beneficial for everyone,Kit,1
Higher populations is good,Kit,1
I don’t even want them to try until they can get steam working with their lfg app,Crizum,1
hahaha yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
"PvP.. i mean I guess crossplay is fine, assuming they go the COD route and restrict it between platforms unless you opt in lol",Kit,1
I wonder if the MCC will have it,RonInDune,1
after modern warfare come out sometime,Arixama,1
"I think I'm in the minority who only plays CoD for the story, so I don't know how well they did",RonInDune,1
Is there anything on steam with cross play? How do they handle names,Crizum,1
"MCC probably will, you can use m&k already on Xbox one I think?",Crizum,1
"I think some of the fighting games have crossplay on steam, like street fighter",RonInDune,1
I remember someone saying Ark and Minecraft also has crossplay,RonInDune,1
minecraft has it for all but pc,Buttkikker,1
can you mod minecraft on console?,RonInDune,1
not to my knowledge,Buttkikker,1
"I'm fairly excited for the MCC as well, the gunplay in the recent Halo reach demo looks so good",RonInDune,1
Also feels very much like Destiny,RonInDune,1
They were probably working on destiny while finishing up reach,Crizum,1
Though I'm worried the PvP skill cap will be immense,RonInDune,1
i think you can mod minecraft on console but its super limited to whats in the store,Kit,1
I wonder if the original Halo people are still in Bungie,RonInDune,1
Jason Jones is,Crizum,1
Pinned a message.,thegoaliebear,1
Twab is out,Trissin,1
||Are there really no new IB weapons?||,Trissin,1
😓,Lonk,1
it's 500 kills each.,thegoaliebear,1
bring out that monarque,Trissin,1
is that the lightning? does the chain count,Lonk,1
"You're thinking of the trinity ghoul, monarque is the poison",Trissin,1
But for trinity ghoul the chain kills should count yes,Trissin,1
"I’d guess the lightning would count, risk runner chains count",Crizum,1
i'm using the exotic primary bow atm,Lonk,1
so i can use LQ in energy,Lonk,1
wish-ender?,Trissin,1
ye,Lonk,1
im trying to figure out what lq is,Trissin,1
lol,Lonk,1
L||oaded|| Q||uestion||,Lonk,1
ohhhhhhhhhhh,Trissin,1
lmao,Trissin,1
"it's not as bad as I thought, 20% bow kills in 1 match",Lonk,1
"for those in the raid tonight, if you've watched Datto's video...I think I like the second strategy they do more tbh. lmk yalls thoughts on it tho.",thegoaliebear,1
"It seems to be the quicker option imo, and ad clear shouldn't be a problem, so I'm down for the second strategy as well",Peronix,1
yeah. we're all properly leveled for it. but having 4 people outside should also help ad clearing go much faster. same with having 2 people in at the same time.,thegoaliebear,1
I haven’t played in like 3 days,GustingWind,1
I’m having withdrawls,GustingWind,1
that is rough.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I agree. I like the idea of having dedicated mote team,Kit,1
instead of having 6 different people rotating motes..,Kit,1
"Four to take care of boss arena, 2 to handle motes",Kit,1
Agreed. The first strategy opens up the door for more confusion,Peronix,1
Yeah it's just waaaaay too much rotation,Kit,1
mhm...just organizes things more. i think we will definitely have this thing tonight haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I wanna be team mote bois,Kit,1
:D,Kit,1
So you want the easy job lol,Crizum,1
Lol i just like collcting motes :b Idc wat i do,Kit,1
I’ll have to watch the video to see what two strategies you are all talking about. We did 2 teams finish blue then switch to red,Crizum,1
Spawns less cyclops,Crizum,1
it's very straightforward in the video. nothing too fancy about it but i think it's just a lot easier on people not having to worry about rotating or switching around or whatever. and you only need one team to do it.,thegoaliebear,1
"I mean, sounds pretty much the same. 2 people go through portal on blue side twice to get 30 motes, then move over to red side and repeat. At least that's what I get from it",Kit,1
"basically 3 groups of 2 I guess. 2 on blue managing cyclops and ads, 2 on red doing the same. 2 on mote team that cover both sides",Kit,1
"@Crizum same here, that's what my team used day 1",Trissin,1
"yeah. we can have one person from each ""team"" that go into the portal together. that way we can keep an even 2-2 outside.",thegoaliebear,1
my group rotated 2 teams of 2 collectors to first finish blue and then finish red,Trissin,1
Because when you destroy the weak spot to bring the first team back the second team can go in and you aren’t spawning a bunch of extra cyclops,Crizum,1
so efficient and much faster becuase you got 2 people clearing adds for motes,Trissin,1
exactly yeah,Trissin,1
Is there a reason to have 2 teams rotate collector?,Kit,1
Instead of just having the same 2 people do it for both sides,Kit,1
The buff you get when banking to remove shields on vex,Crizum,1
day 1 was different from what it is now,Trissin,1
I know that @Crizum,Kit,1
I havent played it without the contest modifier yet,Trissin,1
so maybe the strat that I used is outdated,Trissin,1
Yeah Datto’s second strat is the k e we used,Crizum,1
yeh that's the strat we were saying seemed better anyway lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Two in they bank, different two in they bank, first team goes to opposite portal",Crizum,1
I guess I’m getting confused cause @Kit is saying the same two people and not two teams,Crizum,1
I can't tell if we're saying the same thing lol,Kit,1
"If ya have 2 teams of 2 going through both portals at the same time, ur leaving only 1 on each side to manage cyclops, weak spots, and gobs",Kit,1
Which im assuming is NOT what you're saying,Kit,1
"ah, yeah I'm saying both teams go in blue",Crizum,1
"(1 + 2) go to blue portal and collect 15 - 18 motes.
(1 + 2) return, (3 + 4) go to blue portal and collect 15 - 18 motes.
(1+2) go to red portal and collect 15 - 18 motes.
(1  + 2) return, (3 + 4) go to red portal and collct 15 - 18 motes.

(5 + 6) remain at boss at all times",Trissin,1
when the first team gets out the second team goes in,Crizum,1
^^^,Trissin,1
"you only open each portal twice, so you only have to deal with 4 cyclops in total",Trissin,1
"the mote collecting teams have 2 people, so they are safer, can move more quickly, and bring back more motes so only 2 trips required (per relay)",Trissin,1
The only thing to be careful of is spacing out the times at which people deposit their motes,Trissin,1
My team pretty much had this encounter down - no problems with motes/add clearing at all,Trissin,1
Its just we didn't have the raw DPS to bring down the boss,Trissin,1
i think what kit was getting confused with was *when* mote team goes into the portal.,thegoaliebear,1
"got through like 3 damage phases, he had like maybe 20 or 25% health left",Trissin,1
ah.,Trissin,1
Yeah we're saying the same thing.,Kit,1
About to enter vex offensive for the first time lol,Trissin,1
"Never mind, haven't unlocked it lol",Trissin,1
!lfg search,Arixama,1
So how good is Sleeper in the meta right now ? It's the only exotic heavy that I've not been seeing at all these days,RonInDune,1
Not great.,Infernosi,1
Damage per shot is quite low.,Infernosi,1
Such a sad fall for a great gun. It's one of my fave exotics,RonInDune,1
WE DONE IT BOIS,Arixama,1
Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
Great job,LW Mugetsu,1
Anyone set up a raid for later? I've never been through a raid :blob:,Rox,1
depending on the time id be happy to help,Buttkikker,1
"Nice, you good for 12 hours from now?",Rox,1
"@Arixama nice! I ended up passing out almost immediately, happy for y’all",Crizum,1
"@Rox unfortunately i won't be on until late tonight and will only be playing for an hour or so. however, if you know a specific day and time you would be available for a raid, you can use the `!lfg create` command to make a post for one!",thegoaliebear,1
"Hey, I'm looking for some opinions.
Let's say you had a very important raid coming up tomorrow, ...maybe around reset time, and you wanted to have a good gun for it.

Which of these do you think you could finish faster?

21% Delirium: <https://i.imgur.com/LIRWjg2.png>
or
Wendigo GL3: <https://i.imgur.com/Jd7hyh8.png>",Lonk,1
Wendigo,Arixama,1
Do you have swarm + spike?,Trissin,1
yes,Lonk,1
Then I might actually recommend delirium instead,Trissin,1
finish 21%. it's more useful throughout the other encounters tbh.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah I'd go 21% myself,Oathbreaker,1
I gotta get it too,Oathbreaker,1
it will make quick use for add clearing especially in the second and third encounters. @Lonk,thegoaliebear,1
Why not both? Super close for delirium and should be able to finish it in a couple matches of prime.,Arixama,1
"Hm, okay. I'll try for the envoys then before tomorrow",Lonk,1
yeah if time remains i'll begin finishing the other,Lonk,1
but i don't have so much time before then so that's why I wanted opinions on one 👌,Lonk,1
yeah...wendigo is good BUT you have a swarm with spike so that's just fine if you did want to use a GL at any point. the encounters are fairly close range so i wouldn't recommend something with the potential to kill yourself haha.,thegoaliebear,1
MT 👀,Lonk,1
Haha,Crizum,1
Not a fan of mt in Garden,Trissin,1
for the first encounter a GL is good. but also it'll depend what role you're doing in the encounters.,thegoaliebear,1
Well wendigo+mt is probably not the loadout for garden,Crizum,1
But the first two encounters mt+21% can do some work,Crizum,1
Just try to have an smg/auto/hand cannon with anti-barrier or overload rounds,Crizum,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
i have anti barrier on breakneck and overload on recluse. worked real well. but definitely comes down to preference for which weapons you choose to use.,thegoaliebear,1
there's barrier in gos?,Lonk,1
yeah not too many tho. just in the second encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, but in addition to barrier mobs the anti-barrier rounds can go through the shields on vex minds and when hobgoblins heal",Crizum,1
A recluse with anti-barrier is op,Crizum,1
mhm. super nice. especially for dealing with angelics.,thegoaliebear,1
@Arixama what method on void titan again did you say was good for the grenade/melee kill farm?,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear middle tree sentinal with void wall grenades,Arixama,1
I used an empty sword for most of the melee kills though,Arixama,1
sweet. was there a certain lost sector that was really fast? i was just going to the one in archer's line.,thegoaliebear,1
"I know the raid counts as on the moon, I think vex incursion may also? Maybe just to save grinding the kills out until you’re done in the incursion?",Crizum,1
ugh realized i never played the first SK mission on my titan haha. oh well...gotta start somewhere.,thegoaliebear,1
"Vex incursions after public events is what I used for the grenades since you get a fuck ton of vex, and not a lot of people are doing them super consistently.",Arixama,1
Btw don’t forget armormentarium,Crizum,1
Or however it’s spelled,Crizum,1
Raid and vex offensive both count as moon locations,Arixama,1
"Also don't forget, if you've got Monte carlo thats a lotta melee abilities",Trissin,1
Yeah I think most of my melee was done in phase 2 of the raid with monte,Crizum,1
"Or since you’re on pc you can load a public event flag, use melee and grenade, and reload the zone for the flag again",Crizum,1
whew...92% on grenade kills. those triumphs are such a grind lol.,thegoaliebear,1
If sentinel Titan do bottom tree,Crizum,1
I think that refunds grenade energy on grenade kills,Crizum,1
Middle tree is better with void wall because it applies detonator on every pulse that grant ability energy back. I used heart of inmost light for the empowerment on using abilities to get everything up super fast,Arixama,1
Yeah I guess that’s better if surrounded and detonator counts as grenade kills,Crizum,1
I just hate void wall,Crizum,1
Just because it isn’t the solar grenade,Crizum,1
grenades are done haha...now just the melee kills.,thegoaliebear,1
I think supers count. At least way of the wraith does,Crizum,1
Possibly shield hits too,Crizum,1
yeah i switched to bottom tree. shield bash kills count as well and you can get like three or four at a time if ads are grouped up.,thegoaliebear,1
I think people said you can use a sword for the melee?,Lonk,1
make it run out of ammo and match the energy you need,Lonk,1
yeah that's what i'm doing.,thegoaliebear,1
just farming a lost sector. went from 52% to 82% in like 15 mins aha.,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] i'll be on around 1030 EST tonight just for an hour or so doing some crucible to make some progress on randy's throwing knife. if anyone wants to join then lmk.,thegoaliebear,1
so i have been using Edgewise in Vex Offensive and honestly it's real good. i enjoy it.,thegoaliebear,1
demolitionist is nice but i've preferred using rampage. thing absolutely shreds through ads.,thegoaliebear,1
Don't let them get a word in edgewise,Kit,1
If that isnt the flavor text ill be v disappointed,Kit,1
"the rainbow pins are back for sale, if anyone missed out the first time: https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1182717500317818881",RonInDune,1
God Damnit bungie I just gave you a bunch of my money 😭,Arixama,1
Atleast the shipping isn't as astronomical as usual,RonInDune,1
What was the shipping on your grimoire?,Arixama,1
So $12,RonInDune,1
And it's $4.76 for the pride pin,RonInDune,1
Anyone else pre-order those shoes?,Kit,1
"I got the pin and the grimoire and shipping was just over 12, so it's flat rate shipping boxes",Arixama,1
:yay:,Kit,1
"I don't like ordering shoes online, they never fit quite right and I'm not perfectly used to the American sizes",RonInDune,1
Ari that makes sense but still $12 ...,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, really depends on the brand.. but even then they vary between styles",Kit,1
"They didnt do half sizes, so i just went with 9 since I'm usually 8.5-9",Kit,1
I didnt know they were dropping a black pair till it went live. Had to scoop them up,Kit,1
"Shipping on my grimoire book was also $ 11.90, but it was 2day priority, not parcel",Kit,1
"I want the shoes, but if the decision on how much money I get to spend on gaming clothes is shoes vs raid jacket I gotta go with the jacket :/",Crizum,1
I hear ya. Not sure I'm gonna pick up the jacket.. It's kinda really ugly imo :what:,Kit,1
Bungie should collaborate with yeezy,RonInDune,1
Yeah no please keep Kanye away,Crizum,1
The giant black doom dorito under the moon is actually Kanye's post apocalyptic recording studio backup,RonInDune,1
I'm not buying the raid jacket haha. it's so expensive and I'd never wear it.,thegoaliebear,1
^^,RonInDune,1
Pins/Seals/Books are about as far as I'm going,RonInDune,1
It’s less to wear and more to have. Goblin brain and all that,Crizum,1
i will probably get the t shirt for the raid tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"That's right, anybody want my jacket code?",Trissin,1
I don't really buy the raid jackets,Trissin,1
"I should have given my crown jacket too, but I forgot about it",Trissin,1
I remember people on reddit saying Crown raid jackets were selling for >$150 on ebay,RonInDune,1
"I've been of the mindset that if I want that jacket, I get that completion myself",Oathbreaker,1
Very agreed,RonInDune,1
Wait I got the Anomalous Signal emblem and not the True Colours one,RonInDune,1
From the pin,RonInDune,1
The pin itself should come with the code? Since it was a live event thing,Crizum,1
ohhh,RonInDune,1
that's probably the general emblem you get if you buy something during the season going on at the time.,thegoaliebear,1
not 100% sure tho.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I see that makes sense,RonInDune,1
Probably got the Anomalous Signal from the purchase during season 8 and you'll get the other emblem from the pin itself,Oathbreaker,1
@RonInDune it should have added True Colors and Anomalous to your cart,Kit,1
You'd get an email with a link that would open 2 different PDF's with the code,Kit,1
"It only added Anomalous, and I got the one email. It's similar to Emblem of Synth from last season",RonInDune,1
Lemme check the store page again,RonInDune,1
Hmm,Oathbreaker,1
Oh this seems to clear that up:,RonInDune,1
Mine wasnt lol,Kit,1
I got it immediatly,Kit,1
weird,RonInDune,1
welp gotta contact customer service then,RonInDune,1
When did you order it? Maybe they changed the procedure?,RonInDune,1
12:05pm,Kit,1
CST,Kit,1
for anyone grinding edgewise its heavyweight today,Buttkikker,1
^^ get it yall it's a good lmg.,thegoaliebear,1
still skeptical of it being better than 21%,Buttkikker,1
but good no doubt,Buttkikker,1
i've liked it a bit more. i guess since i'm on hunter i have my dodge reload so overflow isn't a sorely missed perk on my end aha.,thegoaliebear,1
thats fair,Buttkikker,1
"Heavyweight on the strikes playlist, right?",Arixama,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
I think Killing Tally lasting forever and doing quite a bit more damage kinda pushes 21% over the edge,RonInDune,1
thats my thought,Buttkikker,1
just the uptime on the damage,Buttkikker,1
and im not sure if it was nerfed like rampage,Buttkikker,1
It wasn't!,RonInDune,1
so more damage and more uptime,Buttkikker,1
"But edgewise has demolitionist/field prep etc., which are very useful perks",RonInDune,1
it's definitely worth getting. always nice to have another mg option.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah def agreed,RonInDune,1

How was the boss encounter guys?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
ez clap,Trissin,1
jk it took us a few runs lol,Trissin,1
"we called our final attempt, and actually got it on our last run",Trissin,1
Nice! Happy for yall,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Any further attempts this weekend?,RonInDune,1
!lfg search,Crizum,1
"Just the one you’re in Ron, still need a person if anyone is interested",Crizum,1
I have a checkpoint at the boss - I’m out of town but monday night I’d like to use it if we have enough interest,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I could create a lfg,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Raid ready 👍,Lonk,1
I'm up to 931 so I think I'm ready to give it a go.,LW Mugetsu,1
yeah you'll be fine. i was 933 when i did the boss and had no issues.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm at 912 with zero experience in the raid so far. Be honest: would I be able to put in enough work in time to finish the raid before reset?,Thawxtem,1
"You might be able to pull it off, but it would be tough and probably require a lot of competitive crucible.",Nahkriin,1
"Thawx it's doable, but you're going to need to grind fast, do literally all the bounties everywhere, plus the vex invasions on the moon",RonInDune,1
Remember some vendors drop +0 stuff to max out your gear,RonInDune,1
Is there a particular recommended order? ex: crucible-> vex-> bounties-> vendors,Thawxtem,1
I'd say that's a good order. Just make sure it's comp Crucible for those sweet powerful drops every sub-rank,Peronix,1
Crucible give powerfuls even if you drop back and gain,RonInDune,1
Is there a limit/goal to reach for vex/crucible,Thawxtem,1
namely vex,Thawxtem,1
"Also, does Black Armory fit in anywhere?",Thawxtem,1
Unfortunately Black Armory does not drop powerfuls,RonInDune,1
they did away with a lot of the powerful drops,LW Mugetsu,1
Btw @Arixama the deluxe edition ||Cryptoglyph links now forwarding to full texts: https://redd.it/dgm3lx||,RonInDune,1
some of the dreaming city stuff will drop powerful gear like the well and possibly from the weekly mission.,LW Mugetsu,1
i went up 10 levels since tuesday,LW Mugetsu,1
anyone willing to go through a nightfall?,Thawxtem,1
There's matchmaking now,RonInDune,1
oh. alrighty then. thanks for the heads up,Thawxtem,1
Do Nightfall:The Ordeal for matchmaking,RonInDune,1

"@RonInDune i really like how they lean into the religious side of Hive when it comes to them and their throne world. the capitalization of ""He"" and ""Him"" really goes along with how Hive see their ""gods"" but also implies that maybe we as Guardians throughout history saw them as gods too.",thegoaliebear,1
That is indeed pretty cool. Plus they call us liars/heretics,RonInDune,1
Calus called them on their bullshit,Crizum,1
"Yeah but Savathûn has already infiltrated Calus' memoires, so i don't know how much out golden space daddy can actually push back",RonInDune,1

"went up 5 light to 917 tonight; is this looking promising for the raid if this continues? (btw, what is your recommended light for raid?)",Thawxtem,1
"That's pretty good progress, I would try to get up to 925-930 because the final encounter's recommended light is 940. Make sure that you do as many bounties as you can to level up your artifact as well. I would definitely get a second opinion though.",Nahkriin,1

"tomorrow if i can, i might hop on before pvp if anyone wants to try and defeat the vex overlords on the moon for the triumph. 3 people at our PLs will be plenty.",thegoaliebear,1
"I found out the hard way that I don't have enough solo damage for an overlord, barely even got a third of its health",RonInDune,1
So I'm down,RonInDune,1
yeah i had a 910 guy in my instance one day and we got the overlord down to like...15% health. so if we get a third that will help us get the extra damage numbers.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm glad they're tuned enough that you can't solo them, but not so hard you can't do it with a full fireteam",Arixama,1
for sure. having all 3 people is nice since that extra person really makes a difference in damage.,thegoaliebear,1
"Do mods like Major Resist, Boss Resist, ect stack?",Lonk,1
It should say on the mod if it does or does not stack with multiple copies,Crizum,1
Oh weird those ones don't,Crizum,1
yeah the dreambane mods do but not the resist ones,Lonk,1
I believe they do.,Arixama,1
@Destiny [PC] any chance there’s a person available that would like to try for Divinity?,Crizum,1

yeah,Lonk,1
are you using your gambit guys to tether?,Spitfire2266,1
It just may be people being under 930,Crizum,1
you can 3 phase under 930 its tough though,Spitfire2266,1
izanagis is unreal for dmg,Spitfire2266,1
poor man's izanagis,Lonk,1
oh nooooo rip,Trissin,1
"if you dont have izanagi's, try substituting sole survivor",Trissin,1
or whisper,Spitfire2266,1
firing line + 4th time/triple tap/field,Trissin,1
his chest has a huge crit multiplier so whisper is decent,Spitfire2266,1
"Whisper and darci might work too, but generally you want to run a GL with auto-loading for just a bit of extra dmg",Trissin,1
yea i wouldnt recommend darci since he moves a fair bit but whisper and then a sole survivor is good,Spitfire2266,1
like izanagi's is rly good damage but the boss is a real big damage sponge,Trissin,1
i used izanagi and wendigo with recluse,Spitfire2266,1
seems like the best loadoout,Spitfire2266,1
fast clear for gambit and good boss dmg,Spitfire2266,1
i used DARCI and it worked just fine. you're really not going to be pressed for damage unless you're super under leveled for it.,thegoaliebear,1

"sup nerds, anyone wanna be @rozak and I's 3rd for master ordeal",Chance,1
might be tough because we are both around 940,Chance,1
hunter warlock,Chance,1
@Destiny [PC],Chance,1
Just got home - figure pvp memes have ended for the night?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
@Chance would love to do the 3rd tier (not at comp yet) at 950 but im only 935 or so and dont have divinity yet so unsure about trying 980,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Basically still need to do 100k mightfall but 980 might be iffy. I do have izanagis tho,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
oh hey I just got monte carlo from a  comp game,RonInDune,1
think Bungie is taking pity on me,RonInDune,1
damn we just found a 3rd tho,Chance,1
I finally got a one two punch shotgun from the moon,RonInDune,1
oh nice,Buttkikker,1
still need one myself,Buttkikker,1
I think the moon has a fixed one-two punch roll on the first drop?,RonInDune,1
"Also, fairly late but bread finally acquired",RonInDune,1
oh nice,Buttkikker,1
*it is done*,Peronix,1
I’m a sad boi,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"If I can’t use this checkpoint tonight, I would love to raid tomorrow or wednesday night ❤️",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"@Peronix Love the flavor text on that gun. How do you like it, worth the grind?",Lonk,1
"It feels great to use! If you don't mind Crucible, I'd say it's worth it",Peronix,1
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) I’ll be around, if you can’t find another 6th let me know",Crizum,1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) I can definitely raid tomorrow night. and i do prefer that since i don't really have time for leveling other characters so the powerful drops will help.,thegoaliebear,1
"I can as well, pretty much every day aside from Thursday evening since I’m currently between jobs heh",Crizum,1
i just have a huge exam tomorrow so won't be on at all tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
"Come on...
<https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dhoya8/2_man_sanctified_mind_sol_inherent_3_phase_kill/>",Lonk,1
imagine not having a life.,thegoaliebear,1
so glad i can't.,thegoaliebear,1
pun intended.,thegoaliebear,1
@Oathbreaker @Trissin when you guys gunna do this one?,Arixama,1
I haven't even *tried* the raid,Oathbreaker,1
So tomorrow,Oathbreaker,1
😂 😂,Arixama,1
dethrone those Redeem scrubs.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm waiting for ""solo calus, Randy's only""",Arixama,1
when i get my medals done 7 years from now we can try it.,thegoaliebear,1
!rank gos,thegoaliebear,1
solo Calus is only technically possible IF you control 2 pcs with a single person,Oathbreaker,1
only PC clan members have done Garden so far. we LOVE that.,thegoaliebear,1
otherwise not possible to solo,Oathbreaker,1
"14 people have completions in our clan, that's pretty good for week 1",Lonk,1
i don't think any raids in D2 can be 100% solo'd and honestly i like that.,thegoaliebear,1
"Nah, they're too mechanics heavy to do that",Oathbreaker,1
yeah i like it tbh.,thegoaliebear,1
I love blueberries,Crizum,1
“Get ready I’m bringing this grenade stuck to my face to you”,Crizum,1
😦,Crizum,1
Why bro,Crizum,1
"I'm torn on it, because yeah, Crota's End was a strike, but it would be super fucking cool to see someone solo a raid with extremely difficult mechanics for a solo player",Oathbreaker,1
"(I’m less salty today since scout rifle kills are done, but I still feel bad going 100% jotunn)",Crizum,1
Closest we’ll see is one person doing all the damage and a second just for mechanics?,Crizum,1
within the current environment would be someone multi-boxing (controlling 2 pcs) an entire raid,Oathbreaker,1
the only raid that can be done on would be something like Crown I think,Oathbreaker,1
I think eater would be the most likely,Arixama,1
I don't think Eater is possible due to leapfrog,Oathbreaker,1
"You need 5/6 people for that encounter, do you not?",Oathbreaker,1
"Would love to do this fam. Anyone is welcome. Experience helps go by quicker so if you are new, please look up encounter guides. We got this in one night",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
@here GoS full clear tomorrow night 8 pm est. RIP my checkpoint but this group is excellent so excited to do it again,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i won't be home until like 815 most likely if that's fine.,thegoaliebear,1
well that's the latest all depends how long my midterm takes i could be home earlier.,thegoaliebear,1
gl ady! And that's fine. 15 min not gonna make or break anybody. I just wanted to give decent time to get thru it in one sitting (I think is doable with the group we could have),obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Does arbalest count as fusion rifles for the purposes of cold fusion medals?,Crizum,1
thanks it's a huge midterm so I'm going hard tonight for it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
@Crizum i'm not sure but maybe try it and see? if it does count then that's a nice alternative lol.,thegoaliebear,1
It doesn’t count. Back to sandbagging with the toaster,Crizum,1
rip.,thegoaliebear,1
i just have to crank out these scout kills. then i can play like a total asshole haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Truly as Bungie intended,Crizum,1
LOL,Crizum,1
“Medicare for Thrall” is on my team,Crizum,1
hahaha love that.,thegoaliebear,1
was there something people have been using in energy slot that they prefer over black scorpion?,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"I have a strong legendary primary scout, but i need a good legendary option as I want to keep my exotic for last word or thorn in the build. Also preferably solar, but that's not super necessary. I know someone mentioned using something other than scorpion",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
black scorpion is probs the best option in that slot for scouts. I've actually been using black tiger which is the blue version of it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
that's what it was,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
ok. i have a curated no feelings. I'll try both out,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i might get a better rolled black scorpion,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
the unfortunate thing is that people actually try in crucible ?? so constantly running into shotgun apes with last word/ace/thorn is annoying.,thegoaliebear,1
ya that's why I want to have that additionally as well. play on their level,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
also quickplay ----- waaaaay worse than comp fwiw,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i have to say last night was hella fun just fucking around as a stack.,thegoaliebear,1
literally not giving a shit about the control objectives😂 i went from 52% to 72% on my scout kills and,thegoaliebear,1
wait for it,thegoaliebear,1
huge progress on medals,thegoaliebear,1
21% to 23%!,thegoaliebear,1
*the real end game is the friendgame*,Arixama,1
how do they fuck up the tuning so badly for this.,thegoaliebear,1
I missed the messages from earlier but big congrats @RonInDune !!!!,Trissin,1
Once you have your scout rifle kills @thegoaliebear put on a set of fusion rifle boosting armor and use jotunn. Getting 3-5% per match. Who cares if it’s throwing,Crizum,1
Does anyone want an anomalous signal emblem? I've got an extra one,Arixama,1
sick. idc about stats after that lmao i just wanna get this shit done😂,thegoaliebear,1
Telesto would probably also work,Crizum,1
Thanks trissin!,RonInDune,1
Hey what clan is Mtashed in?,Crizum,1
Resolute I think,Infernosi,1
Oh so it is him,Crizum,1
"Still laughing at Dr. **** you, PhD.",Crizum,1

"get on it, detectives",RonInDune,1
I'm on raidsecrets atm as well and just read an amazing tidbit,Lonk,1

there's so much material for this midterm it's ungodly -_- all i wanna do is play destiny lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
You can do it! It's all for a good cause!,RonInDune,1
so i'm about halfway through this study guide and there's still 8 more powerpoints to go.,thegoaliebear,1
and each one has *at least* 60 slides.,thegoaliebear,1
dayum,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
8 page study guide and still 6 powerpoints to go.,thegoaliebear,1
and...,thegoaliebear,1
single spaced no less.,thegoaliebear,1
The puzzle has been solved: ||https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1183853014236291078||,Trissin,1
Yeah I was talking earlier about how badass one of the texts made Eris sound!,RonInDune,1
anyone feel like leveling up the season pass?,Thawxtem,1
I'm like level 35-ish and mostly by doing lots and lots of bounties,RonInDune,1
"Do every single bounty you can find anywhere, and then do the infinite ones",RonInDune,1
"i think I'm like 32 or something. haven't actually dedicated myself to bounties that's just passive bounties from gunsmith, pvp, and eris most recently over the last week or so for me.",thegoaliebear,1
more concerned with these ritual weapons hahaha. so i don't always remember to grab bounties specifically.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm 51,Arixama,1
nice.,thegoaliebear,1
"i really just said ""i'm gonna take a 25 min study break"" and i said that at like 7:15 what happened LOL",thegoaliebear,1
"i mean, to me it only looks like 7 minutes😬",Arixama,1
hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
i've literally been distracted for nearly two hours now.,thegoaliebear,1
goal go study,Oathbreaker,1
don't be me,Oathbreaker,1
and play destiny instead of studying,Oathbreaker,1
that's my thing,Oathbreaker,1
"update: 10 page, single-spaced study guide complete. and now i still have the textbook chapters to review.",thegoaliebear,1
i am not in grad school yet i can't do this shit currently lmaooo.,thegoaliebear,1
YOu can do this!!,RonInDune,1
Grad school is way easier trust me,RonInDune,1
oh i'm honestly looking forward to it.,thegoaliebear,1
won't have all this hockey shit taking up an unnecessary amount of my time 😂,thegoaliebear,1

"Basically, do we still have to do the ""everybody split up and fast travel to glacial drift until we find each other""",Trissin,1
"For ep it is still 3, but with good loadout 3 should be enough",Arixama,1
"ah, I see.",Trissin,1
"Yeah, it should be but I've got a few kinderguardian friends who are new to the game",Trissin,1
Was thinking of running it through with them,Trissin,1
THat reminds me I have a bunch of encrypted and decrypted cache keys lying around,RonInDune,1
Gotta use them at some point,RonInDune,1
I'll be looking to get a set of EP armor 2.0,Trissin,1
Yeah EP armour looks so good!,RonInDune,1
Warmind in general had the best aesthetic,RonInDune,1
the real endgame isn't raids or dungeons or seals,Trissin,1

Iron Banner time? :derp_blob:,CrizMobius,1
Still doing iron banner @CrizMobius?,Crizum,1
from the cryptograph lore posted by bungie 😬,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune ^ ik you like the lore.,thegoaliebear,1
It is pretty exciting! That's similar to how Xivu Arath and Savathûn came back to life the first time after Oryx killed them,RonInDune,1
it would be insane if that's actually where this season and/or year of D2 leads to.,thegoaliebear,1
"I still want to see if Savathûn's plan to take over the Distributary works, but yeah this is pretty great as well. Especially since Oryx will now be far weaker since he's no longer the Taken King",RonInDune,1
alright fam...midterm time is here. see yall on the other side💀😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
"Good luck, you got this!!!",RonInDune,1
good luck,Buttkikker,1

Peak Bungo,Crizum,1
Honestly I've been responsible for some pretty terrible bugs so I can empathize,RonInDune,1
that's like a metaphor for the kind of questions on my exam😂,thegoaliebear,1
You've made it!,RonInDune,1
i survived haha.,thegoaliebear,1
good!!,Trissin,1
and finished early. so more time for destiny tonight😂,thegoaliebear,1
i have another midterm tomorrow but it's in my easy class so i can just study before it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
iron banner quest is SUPER easy,Arixama,1
I'll be on around 715 est so if anyone wants to try for the overlords on the moon lmk. i need the ones in the Hellmouth and anchor of light. rng permitting lol. @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
so you have to do the iron banner quest on all character,Arixama,1
nice can't wait to not do it.,thegoaliebear,1
"I know I haven’t really done anything in destiny lately, but I’d appreciate it if I could keep my spot in the clan unless you need more room. I do plan on coming back, I just haven’t had a ton of free time lately, and what time I’ve had I just haven’t been motivated to dive into the new mechanics. Thanks for keeping me around guys",Pentan,1
no worries you're fine.,thegoaliebear,1
won't really be doing a bunch of active recruiting anyway i feel we have a good number and core group now.,thegoaliebear,1
Did y'all see that pay2win login crap?,Lonk,1
Just remember to praise Lord Shaxx every night and you're good,RonInDune,1
wait what,Trissin,1
in destiny?,Trissin,1
oh wow,Trissin,1
Huh I had a free one that I used on my titan to skip all the pre Forsaken content,RonInDune,1
Wow,Pentan,1
Yeah they’ve done these before,Crizum,1

"Does Iron Banner count towards randys throwing knife quest?

goin in for a marathon with jade rabbit then,Lonk,1
lmk if it seems like it goes up faster lol.,thegoaliebear,1
doesnt seem to be,Arixama,1

man i suck so bad with scout rifle on pc,Lonk,1
four matches and i've gone up 2% for randy's,Lonk,1
i still use controller when i play pvp,thegoaliebear,1
~~Does it give aim assist on pc?~~,Lonk,1
A little yeah,Crizum,1
Targeting adjuster and enhanced scout rifle targeting helps a lot,RonInDune,1
"Wow holy crap, plugged in controller and immedietly got 4 kill multi kill",Lonk,1
yeah ima go this route for pvp lol,Lonk,1
@RonInDune you ready?,Arixama,1
Ah I'm so sorry,RonInDune,1
Can you find a +1?,RonInDune,1
!lfg search,Arixama,1

@ruGGed_koala @the_drake1997 either one of you available for garden rn?,thegoaliebear,1
Not at the moment... Sorry. Maybe in an hour or so?,the_drake1997,1
yeah we'll still be on unless rugged is available sooner.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm running back right now, I'll try to make it",RonInDune,1
sweet no worries. we're just doing pvp so @ us whenever.,thegoaliebear,1
I already have Divinity so if you get a +1 start up without me,RonInDune,1
it's fine we have a couple people who haven't gotten the quest started yet so we're not doing it aha.,thegoaliebear,1
How do you start that sum Bitch???,the_drake1997,1
you go to where the raid starts and kill a bunch of stuff and the gatelord will drop and exotic engram which is the quest.,thegoaliebear,1
and this is done in free mode don't actually load into the raid haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Just downloading the update,RonInDune,1
Will join up in a sec,RonInDune,1
good luck again yall,Trissin,1
How far did y'all make it last week? Or was it as far as we went and that's all?,the_drake1997,1

I can't do at that time,Rye,1
I'll still be at work,Rye,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
this iron banner quest isnt bad at all,Spitfire2266,1
a lot shorter than the first,Spitfire2266,1
will have to drop from the raid tonight sorry guys. have way too much work to get done today.,thegoaliebear,1
so @Destiny [PC] spot open for Garden tonight ^,thegoaliebear,1
I'm in,Rye,1
I finally got my Grimoire Volume II!!,RonInDune,1
I'll join up for the raid!,the_drake1997,1
@Rye have you done it yet? if not just make sure you watch a video!,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune sneak peaks?,Lonk,1
@thegoaliebear I have not,Rye,1
okay. I would definitely watch a video then just to familiarize with the roles and mechanics.,thegoaliebear,1
!rank gos,thegoaliebear,1
ayee i made it on the list this time,Lonk,1
we literally love that.,thegoaliebear,1
Divinity is busted in Gambit I love it,Crizum,1
imagine if I never switched to PC...,thegoaliebear,1
i wouldn't have that week one clear lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
I’ll be sure to study up,Rye,1
Oof the art is amazing. Look at Mara being amazing !,RonInDune,1
😫,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
I won't post anymore to avoid spoilers! But it is certifiably amazing,RonInDune,1
"14,000?! What the hell man 😱",Lonk,1
That quest keeps on giving aha,Crizum,1
i love when people figure out how ridiculous that quest is LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
Is that why they put percentage in game,Lonk,1
To hide the ridiculous number,Lonk,1
That is our collective punishment for doing 2 person raid bosses within a week,RonInDune,1
Gotta funnel people in to crucible somehow,Crizum,1
So basically it's all Trissin and Oathbreaker's fault,RonInDune,1
"Not gonna get started on grinding since it might get changed, don't wanna go through the MT experience again

Or at least until near the end of the season, for the title",Trissin,1
Wha,Trissin,1
yeah I'm just trying to get the scout kills done first. i do think it was wrongly tuned and could end up getting changed but whatever progress i make on it whenever i play pvp is fine.,thegoaliebear,1
especially since i really don't have a ton of time now. I'm not gonna make myself crazy over it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I have 3 midterms over the span of the next 36 hours,Trissin,1
yup. i have one today and a big chunk of a project due tomorrow. then i have another essay due tuesday.,thegoaliebear,1
Good luck trissin and goal!,RonInDune,1
neither of which i have started bc everything got pushed out of the way bc of my midterm last night lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Oof that scheduling,Lonk,1
yeah all the while having practice every day and games fri/sat we love that for me💀😂,thegoaliebear,1
Wha how is Randy's my fault,Oathbreaker,1
You were too good at the game and Bungie had to take action,RonInDune,1
not my fault,Oathbreaker,1
i click heads mildly well,Oathbreaker,1
sitting here thinking about how i wish i could raid tonight but decided to be a student instead 😩,thegoaliebear,1
just picked up a taken armaments mod :BAblobby:,Arixama,1
😮,Trissin,1
From Last wish?,RonInDune,1
2.0 taken armaments from wish?,Trissin,1
yup,Arixama,1
luckyyyyyy,Trissin,1
Oh heck we need to do Last Wish runs asap,RonInDune,1
"wait, was this your first wish since 2.0??",Trissin,1
Can we still cheese Riven?,RonInDune,1
second chest i opened using the free chest,Arixama,1
omg,Trissin,1
i think i got my first taken armaments on my 24th run,Trissin,1
hope I dont have to do another 20 runs for 2.0 taken armaments,Trissin,1
"2.0 mod will only slot into ""outlaw"" mod slots",Arixama,1
I don't know what that means,Trissin,1
The seasonal slot for season of the outlaw you mean?,Crizum,1
I'd rather run CoS for hive armaments,Thawxtem,1
and crown armor 2.0,Thawxtem,1
I find hive and fallen armaments to generally be more useful,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
"for shadowkeep especially, hive armaments",Trissin,1
"However there should also be vex armaments now, yeah?",Trissin,1
"Can’t do tonight, throat is shot",Rye,1
Can barely speak,Rye,1
"oh no, that sounds bad
hope you feel better @Rye",Trissin,1
Me too,Rye,1
It hurts,Rye,1
I’ll be fine in a few days methinks,Rye,1
alright Grimoire is 10/10. Though you can definitely tell which parts were written by professional authors and which parts by video game writers,RonInDune,1
Did this one come with a new emblem??,Trissin,1
Yup it did,RonInDune,1
sweet! Which one?,Trissin,1
if you happen to know the name of it,Trissin,1
"Not yet lol, I redeemed it, but I'll find out which one it is when I log in tonight. I don't want to spoil myself!",RonInDune,1
haha okay!,Trissin,1
"There's a lot of lore from Forsaken in there, it's basically chronicles of the Fallen. Kinda sad too",RonInDune,1
"@here raid goers for tonight. We have options:
1) grab a 6th
2) wait til the weekend or monday when everyone has divinity quest ready and goal has time
3) play iron banner instead at 850 power",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Now.......i’m thinking the 2nd option might be preferrable,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I'm sure there must be someone wanting to hop in,Trissin,1
who isn't busy,Trissin,1
There’s no rush to do it tonight and it maybe best to hold off and wait for a better moment than rush it with not everyone confirmed and this and that,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i'm like 923 at most so there's likely better options,Oathbreaker,1

I can be,Oathbreaker,1
i'm really in no rush to get divinity tbh. i don't have a lot of time to play now so when I'm on my main priority will be Undying stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
option 4) do a different raid,Arixama,1
If our group does it tonight I don’t want to mess about with divinity memes and my titan is still 750 dogshit i’d just want to get it done. I know how bad it feels to have the checkpoint and then miss out because of going out of town so im personally ok with chilling so that we can finish it with our group. For whatever reason that’s a feelsbad to me.,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"I don't mind chilling. We can just have a chill time...or Iron Banner if we want to drown this Discord in sweat, like you mentioned. Doesn't matter to me, though!",Peronix,1
I can do IB as IB doesn’t require me to talk,Rye,1
At least as much as a raid would,Rye,1
need people to help me do the Whisper of the Worm heroic mission,Rye,1
ya......i kinda have this disgusting urge to play ib tonight and raid sat night or sunday,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

i remember i once did not play crucible for a literal entire season.,thegoaliebear,1
it was a glorious time.,thegoaliebear,1
How could it be glorious when you didn't earn any glory?,Peronix,1
Checkmate,Peronix,1
meanwhile I play PvE just to get gear for PvP,Oathbreaker,1
the glory unearned is just personal glory gained.,thegoaliebear,1
think about it.,thegoaliebear,1
the glory has to come from somewhere,Buttkikker,1
but we don't know where exactly.,thegoaliebear,1
"The glory of keeping your sanity, perhaps?",Peronix,1
it remains an enigma.,thegoaliebear,1
I remember once I grinded for Claymore. I then didn't play crucible for an entire 3 seasons,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
it was fine,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
love that for you.,thegoaliebear,1
what about the glory of getting better? No? Just me?,Oathbreaker,1
^ I like that,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
but where does it come from,Buttkikker,1
"getting better at what tho, exactly?",thegoaliebear,1
real talk I like crucible,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
clicking heads,Oathbreaker,1
just wish it was balanced better. but I love it.,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
so you take it from others?,Buttkikker,1
getting better at crucible? getting better at preserving sanity?,thegoaliebear,1
when you think about it,thegoaliebear,1
*whispers* we're all winners.,thegoaliebear,1
I think I got slightly better when I stopped using Blast Furnace/Jotunn and started using Austringer/Sole Survivor,RonInDune,1
I get said glory from a lack of sanity,Oathbreaker,1
when you stopped using the dad loadout @RonInDune,thegoaliebear,1
Sadly yes,RonInDune,1
reminds me,Oathbreaker,1
I need to go play Freelance so I can get NF,Oathbreaker,1
Hey guys Randy’s actually frags so,Crizum,1
"Yeah Comp is very nice now, the only time I came up against sweats was just before Fabled",RonInDune,1
Become the sweat Ron,Crizum,1
Dust rock/energy hand cannon/whatever heavy is in style and go complain that pulses are OP,Crizum,1
I want to finish up Luna's but getting 200 solar handcannon kills is hard,RonInDune,1
"I can't get the hang of Trust, and it's the only good solar I have",RonInDune,1
Just the kills right and not headshots?,Crizum,1
Yeah I think headshots is the next step,RonInDune,1
The worst part for me was I only had the explosive rounds trust and headshots weren’t always counting,Crizum,1
ooof,RonInDune,1
it's just solar kills Ron,Oathbreaker,1
But you also have Erianas now so that should count?,Crizum,1
"Yeah I might try out eriana's, though the recoil is even worse",RonInDune,1
?,RonInDune,1
"It's either you're on the Hand Cannon kills which is any hand cannon, solar kills which is literally any solar damage kill, or hand cannon headshot kills",Oathbreaker,1
I think it's solar hand cannon isnt it,RonInDune,1
nope,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah I'm on the solar step,RonInDune,1
wait,RonInDune,1
oh bloody hell,RonInDune,1
It's just a solar kill,Oathbreaker,1
I'm illiterate,RonInDune,1
Well back to Jotunn it is then,RonInDune,1
I'm 88% on solar kills. honestly this has a been a crutch more than hand cannon precision probably will be,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"I want to do blink contraverse middle tree voidlock so much, but alas",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"if you can, get opening shot/targeting adjuster/enhanced hand cannon targeting combo",RonInDune,1

"Probably after most of the Undying grind is done, only need the vanguard shader and emblem, 980 nightfall ship and leviathans breath",Crizum,1
(And all the offensive triumphs),Crizum,1
yeah. it looks like i'll be able to get on tonight after all. but i think i'd like to get that overlord in the hellmouth and probably just make progress on the gambit stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
speaking of 980 nightfalls anyone interested?,Buttkikker,1
lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm down to try,Peronix,1
is it even specified what the ship drops from? is it literally just the triumph for completing it?,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
And I’m always down to try. This week is good cause divinity disrupts and I have anti-barrier hand cannon rounds,Crizum,1
well that is nice. i'm nowhere near being able to attempt that tho aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"""source: Complete the ""Beacon in the black"" triumph by completing nightfall: the ordeal on master difficulty.""",Buttkikker,1
i am just getting all the vex offensive/seasonal triumphs for Undying done. i have a feeling i will end up having a couple of the collections stuff left after the season ends which i wouldn't mind.,thegoaliebear,1
just don't want to pass over a VO triumph and end up locking myself out of the title lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
I think the shaders and emblems May be season locked,Crizum,1
oh yeah i just meant in terms of the ritual weapon and master NF.,thegoaliebear,1
Something @Arixama found out is killing guardians in gambit counts toward crucible stuff,Crizum,1
His multikills while invading counted for the multikills quest step,Crizum,1

@Buttkikker id be down to attempt the 980 nightfall,Arixama,1
we just have to clear it right?,Arixama,1
Same here.,Infernosi,1
yeah its just to clear it,Buttkikker,1
I’ll be home in about an hour if two others want to try the 980 haha,Crizum,1

Would be nice haha,Crizum,1
Otherwise we may try to duo,Crizum,1
what PL should i ideally be for master nightfall?,thegoaliebear,1
"Probably at least 945 ish, I think",Trissin,1
The 950?,Crizum,1
"oh mb, I thought that was 980",Trissin,1
whichever one gives the ship for Undying lol.,thegoaliebear,1
the ship comes from the 980 recommended,Buttkikker,1
Honestly this is hilarious,Crizum,1
This 980 strike,Crizum,1
yeah so what PL can i be at that i won't  be a hindrance haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Uh Peronix is 950 and we may be able to swing it,Crizum,1
960 is safer but still not safe,Crizum,1
960 with Izanagi makes it okish,Infernosi,1
Hey @obsoleteXeo (Grebe) do you wanna grind some IB,Peronix,1
any super efficient way to earn the points for Exit Strategy?,thegoaliebear,1
medals have been pretty efficient since i've only played a few matches so not concerned about that.,thegoaliebear,1
Smg kills I think risk runner,Crizum,1
Do regular gambit for maximum motage,RonInDune,1
"General kills risk runner too, but if you are trying for the shaders and emblems reaper invader and sentry auras really help",Crizum,1
Don’t like regular gambit haha,Crizum,1
"Prime has more powerful taken and those witches that spawn after every damage phase, which are needed for the shader/emblem quest",Crizum,1
oh riskrunner forgot about that aha. i'll do that thanks. more concerned with getting the ritual weapon rn rather than the shaders/emblem.,thegoaliebear,1
Shaders/emblem are needed for the Undying badge as well,Infernosi,1
We need more for this iron banner meme session haha,Crizum,1
i would but i'm literally going to sleep rn haha.,thegoaliebear,1

@Peronix yes but I had discord memes muted so I missed your msg aaaannnd 2 hrs later rip,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
did you guys know that they murdered break neck,Chance,1
each stack of rampage does less damage,Chance,1
what the hell,Chance,1
"Yeah, and not just rampage. They toned down nearly all of the weapon damage buffs",Trissin,1
"Including kill clip, multi-kill clip, master of arms, etc",Trissin,1
Looks like we know why you can’t use random armor for ornaments,Crizum,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dj1dl5/eververse_is_broken/ in the Halloween section,Crizum,1
If they actually sell the season pass weapon ornaments for silver...,Crizum,1
"I expect them to honestly. People are able to already have them, so people who don't have that kind of time to devote to the game having the option to just outright purchase them after a while makes sense.",Arixama,1
That’s stupid,Crizum,1
Unless I’m paying for recovs I don’t get to buy raid gear and pinnacles,Crizum,1
i mean...it's just an ornament tho.,thegoaliebear,1
I get cosmetics but at a certain point why even play the game if you get to buy everything,Crizum,1
Because it's for people who can't play the game a lot,Arixama,1
"Yeah but the season pass is already filled with junk, taking away the few cool things it has just irritates me haha",Crizum,1
like personally i have never actually bought anything from eververse with silver and have never cared about ornaments so...lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"I already didn’t need five sets of the vex invasion stuff, they already have eververse ornaments that you can’t earn in game",Crizum,1
Though I’ll probably buy the EP armor from eververse so I shouldn’t talk :poker_face:,Crizum,1
"like...i understand why they're doing what they're doing. i don't necessarily think it's great, but personally I'm indifferent.",thegoaliebear,1
"I guess like, I just remember when a cool set of armor meant you did the cool thing and not paid the blue lady space bucks?",Crizum,1
i agree. i mean...at least now you *know* someone paid for it tho haha.,thegoaliebear,1
and tbh i think the raid armor this season is great so.,thegoaliebear,1
I wanna see them eververse the trials armor and see what happens haha. And yeah the raid gear is nice but iirc it’s a prettied up version of the Osiris eververse set,Crizum,1
yeah i don't like the cloak head on it so i just put an ornament on it. rest of it looks real good tho.,thegoaliebear,1
waiting until i have the whole set just need the chest and helmet. then i can put the precursor vex chrome shader on it and it looks like the chatterwhite shader from d1.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ playing gambit tonight. the more the merrier lol.,thegoaliebear,1
What step in the quest for the shaders are you on goal?,Arixama,1
farming that throwing knife in comp :<,Lonk,1
I'm on the second shader.,thegoaliebear,1
"Thats guardians, right?",Arixama,1
but at 25% on guardians defeated after only a few matches last night.,thegoaliebear,1
so it's not that bad.,thegoaliebear,1
"Naw it isn’t I think Ari and I played for a few hours and I finished the second shader, emblem, and exit strategy",Crizum,1
Did you have an aura on or just normal?,Arixama,1
just normal that was in regular gambit.,thegoaliebear,1
The auras are a pretty decent boost,Crizum,1
I'm mostly just curious if they boost in regular gambit,Arixama,1
what auras are for the second shader.,thegoaliebear,1
I think i only have collector and reaper bc i never cared about that season lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Invader, and reaper is for the last two steps",Arixama,1
After guardians it's killing powerful taken,Arixama,1
i can get the reaper aura. i assume prime is better for the emblem step then? for the envoys.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, also you don’t need the armor since you can just use the synth and get a 30 minute boost",Crizum,1
yeah i only have 4 notorious pieces.,thegoaliebear,1
i end up using synths anyways they take up my inventory space lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I farmed out edgewise last night in the 950 ordeal nightfall using the forever spawning cave on nessus in failsafes area,Arixama,1
That was a time,Arixama,1
Was also a good place for the solar melee kills for the strike quest,Arixama,1

I was doing 920,Kronohs,1
Oh perfect thanks!!,Kronohs,1
"Damn 93k, so close",Kronohs,1
"It's quite difficult on 920, yeah. Going to have to kill nearly every add, and complete the strike in good time too",Trissin,1
okay yall I'm getting on in about an hour if anyone wants to see if we can get that overlord in the Hellmouth...or at least have a public event spawn there 😂,thegoaliebear,1
and if there's not one there then I'm starting the gambit grind early lol.,thegoaliebear,1
just check between games,Buttkikker,1
I'm down. Haven't so much as *seen* an Overlord yet:derp:,Peronix,1
haha sounds good. yeah I'll play gambit and keep checking😂,thegoaliebear,1

So Kevin Whitmeyer has started publishing the world art for Garden of Salvation: ||https://www.artstation.com/artwork/gJW8be||,RonInDune,1
It really is a incredibly beautiful raid,RonInDune,1
the music as you travel from encounter to encounter is amazing as well.,thegoaliebear,1
they really leaned into the theme of that salvation/wonder and absolutely nailed it all around.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah I genuinely love this raid, has to be among Bungie's best work ever",RonInDune,1
Is the OST for the raid available already?,RonInDune,1
"I really want a raid on ||the pyramid|| that could lean in to a ||dark, paranoid vibe with reds and blacks with neon||",Crizum,1
Ooh that would be cool,RonInDune,1
"I also want something more on Titan, the arcology is severely underutilized",RonInDune,1
"With like shadow versions of ||some of the most famous destiny weapons, imagine a dark mirror to Gjallarhorn or Khvostov||",Crizum,1
Also I'm kinda mad that when you replay the last story mission ||they don't play the cutscene with your doppelganger||,RonInDune,1
"The pyramid idea sounds *sick*. Maybe the farther along you are in the pyramid, the more twisted and dark things get",Peronix,1
"They always do big final bosses, but imagine you get to the final encounter and it’s ||a fireteam of dead guardians||",Crizum,1
"||The Pyramid architecture reminds me of Warmind/Rasputin, plus there is a lot of connection there if you read the lost sector lore||",RonInDune,1
^^^,RonInDune,1
That'd be freaking amazing,RonInDune,1
Do the Mirror Knight fight from Dark Souls 2,RonInDune,1
Or that one fight from Demon Souls,RonInDune,1
||All the sound getting dampened in the pyramid like you're underwater was such a cool effect||,RonInDune,1
"Just have ||Zavala and Drifter|| narrate the thing, with two opposing views of how you proceed, really lean in to the ||dark or light? You need both|| they are playing with",Crizum,1
Oh hey I didn't know there was a Taikonaut postcard in the collector's edition,RonInDune,1
"Lmao the final encounter of ||pyramid raid|| is a ||fireteam of dead guardians||, time to ||switch to bottom tree striker|| and pull out the ||ace of spades, recluse, one-eyed mask|| let's go lool",Trissin,1
"That’s the thing Trissin, that’s the final boss",Crizum,1
Ace is bad now Trissin,Oathbreaker,1

😮 it is??,Trissin,1
Thorn is exotic hand cannon king lol,Oathbreaker,1
oh wtf lmao,Trissin,1
Hey now what about Not Forgotten with the damage glitch,Crizum,1
"It is in my opinion, it used to absolutely *map*",Oathbreaker,1
"||Image if they make it like gambit, where you can queue into it to rolfstomp some poor guardians just looking to end the raid||",RonInDune,1
Would the dead guardians be affected by the nerfs?,Peronix,1
that would be so cool,Trissin,1
A gambit styled raid would be amazing and terrible all at the same time,Crizum,1
||you can play as the raid boss for other fireteams||,Trissin,1

"NF is weird just because the bug shouldn't exist, and even then, it only hits out to 32m then the bug gets fucky",Oathbreaker,1
"Even with the hit to memento mori, doesn't it have crazy range?",Trissin,1
No,Oathbreaker,1
Basically all Hand Cannons are hard capped at 30m of range,Oathbreaker,1
"oh yeah thats right, all the range nerfs",Trissin,1
"Three ways of bypassing that are rangefinder, opening shot, and bugged mag howl",Oathbreaker,1
"bugged mag howl on NF only right, not lunas?",Trissin,1
I don't count explosive rounds because that splits your damage so you're only dealing a portion of that rather than full damage,Oathbreaker,1
Does explosive payload get hit by range?,RonInDune,1
Oh ok,RonInDune,1
"No, bugged on both",Oathbreaker,1
Luna's *and* NF,Oathbreaker,1
😮,Trissin,1
okay,Trissin,1
Is Sunshot still bad then?,RonInDune,1
Sunshot is eh?,Oathbreaker,1
I hear a mix of good and bad but the issue is that you're gonna lose an exotic slot,Oathbreaker,1
That's true,RonInDune,1
I'm like swashbuckler smgs now for close range,RonInDune,1
"It's nice cause it's slightly bugged I think, where it goes to x5 if you melee kill",RonInDune,1
that's intended,Oathbreaker,1
ah,RonInDune,1
swashbuckler stacks x1 if you get a gun kill with the swashbuckler weapon but instantly stacks to max if you get a melee kill with said gun equipped,Oathbreaker,1
yeah my swashbuckler moon smg was wrecking people even faster than recluse,RonInDune,1
though it was less range I think,RonInDune,1
Now that I’m done with Randy’s I want to build an arc melee build around monte carlo,Crizum,1
Do it on Titan if you're gonna do that,Oathbreaker,1
"Of course, Titan is the way",Crizum,1
use Liar’s Handshake and top tree arc,RonInDune,1
on hunter,RonInDune,1
with x3 Combination Blow you'll wreck bosses,RonInDune,1
With arc battery and synthoceps for the range,Crizum,1
oof,RonInDune,1
"Thundercoil, you mean?",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah my bad,Crizum,1
Arc Battery is the overshield,Oathbreaker,1
no worries,Oathbreaker,1
"oh yeah, that one shots in pvp doesnt it?",Trissin,1
i saw a clip on reddit of someone getting 7th col with that,Trissin,1
With bottom tree I think once you get that first kill yes,Crizum,1
Thundercoil? When stacked with Frontal Assault,Oathbreaker,1
that's kind of dumb,Trissin,1
but I guess it's not something a shotgun cant deal with,Trissin,1
You’re still in prime shotgun range,Crizum,1
yeah,Trissin,1

yeah that was pretty funny if you decide to not blow stuff as a titan,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune,Arixama,1
Kinda wish the side characters got some more screen time,Buttkikker,1

oh is it,Trissin,1
i didnt know that lmao,Trissin,1
welp,Trissin,1
im kinda scared to search it up,Trissin,1
"I didn't know either, until reddit very wisely informed me",RonInDune,1
"Trissin, thats such a good screenshot",Oathbreaker,1
"ah, the wonders of the internet",Trissin,1

The bottom tree striker nerf has been a long time coming,RonInDune,1
https://imgur.com/a/DY07MXI,RonInDune,1
So what becomes the big complaint after this and the inevitable one eyed mask nerf?,Crizum,1
spectral hunters again?,RonInDune,1
Best guess is handheld supernova,Crizum,1
erianas vow probably,Buttkikker,1
or maybe nova locks,RonInDune,1
^^,RonInDune,1
two people teamshoting with erianas is an insta kill no matter what,Buttkikker,1
even body shot,Buttkikker,1
So is two people with a sniper.,Infernosi,1
can't wait to finish out those gambit things tomorrow night lol. was fun playing tonight and making all that progress tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"well, i finally got to 1981 glory after some serious comp effort yesterday. I'm not touching it lol, waiting for Tuesday to roll around; too many horror stories of people pushing it and going back to 1600... nope, not me, not gonna do it.  now the climb for mountaintop 🙄",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Nice!!! Congrats 👊,Trissin,1
Comp grind is not a fun one,Trissin,1
ty 🙂 trying to broaden my collection and get a few meta pieces so i can raid with yall,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"@thegoaliebear @Arixama @RonInDune @Peronix @Crizum Thoughts on availability for this weekend of boss checkpoint? I have tonight available, laaaaaate Saturday night, and all of Sunday",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Sunday is best for me. i get back late tonight from my game so am just gonna finish my gambit quests.,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone up for Friday night GoS raid?,Lonk,1
Sunday is best day. Gives us a ton of time and no pressure for sleep I feel cuz we can start earlier,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"@Lonk i would love to, it'd be my first time.  If you're ok with me possibly making a mistake and have an empty slot, i'm decently geared atm, 950 light.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) if those who didn't have it get the divinity quest going we could also just finish the boss checkpoint we have an do another fresh run after.,thegoaliebear,1
ah I should probably start the divinity quest,Trissin,1
"i've barely gotten to play this season, wish i could be more active",Trissin,1
"it's not too long, is it?",Trissin,1
"no it's not too bad, i don't think anyway, i passively did most of it up to GoS and didn't realize it",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
it's not long. probably takes 15-20 mins to get to the GoS part. maybe not even that long.,thegoaliebear,1
"oh wow lol, that is short yeah",Trissin,1
@thegoaliebear ya I’ll work on that tonight,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I like that. The first 3 encounters are just so quick that’d be dope,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"@obsoleteXeo (Grebe) Sunday works best for me, have d&d tonight and a friends birthday tomorrow night but I can make Sunday happen anytime",Crizum,1
Also have warlock and hunter geared up for a second run if people want to do that for divinity,Crizum,1
If you see me on and need a spot filled hit me up.,LW Mugetsu,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
if the time is too early we can always adjust it but this is just to have everyone in one place for Sunday.,thegoaliebear,1
"There was only one other person who was interested in doing today, so i'll jus...",Lonk,1
nevermind,Lonk,1
i saw there's dibs,Lonk,1
:reeeee:,Lonk,1
Anyone know what the rolls are on Xûr's stuff today? Especially the shards and for transversives,RonInDune,1
It’s whatever the roll in your collections is,Crizum,1
oh damn,RonInDune,1
Hopefully they curate collections a little better for stuff like actium/oathkeepers/lucky pants,Crizum,1
Unless it was intentional because you can use the expensive multi-weapon mods,Crizum,1
@Lonk can always make an lfg post for tonight. that run is for sunday.,thegoaliebear,1
🤷 i asked and only 1 responded so i'm guessing lfg would be low results just be an alt for sunday,Lonk,1
"Doesn't hurt, maybe some people just haven't checked discord yet. Busy with work, classes, etc during the day",Trissin,1
"I might even be able to join tonight, depending on practice + assignments",Trissin,1
and can always do the @.Destiny[PC]. people are morely likely to check when they get a ping for it.,thegoaliebear,1
all very good points,Lonk,1
||I just feel awkward making an lfg if it doesn't fill up||,Lonk,1
happens a lot to all of us haha. it's just a good way to organize people into one place tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"Lol it's good, I get what u mean

Worst case is just push to another time, or just LFG the remaining slots",Trissin,1
i would love to run GoS this weekend or tonight,Buttkikker,1
on all three chars even lol,Buttkikker,1
Idk about clearing it thrice,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
but,Buttkikker,1
"Yeah the one I made we cleared in didn’t fill up, we got lucky and asked in discord/clan chat and found a 6th @Lonk",Crizum,1
LOOOT,Buttkikker,1
idk if ill even be free,Trissin,1
But I hope so!,Trissin,1
@thegoaliebear honestly if ppl are available earlier that’s cool too.,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
I’ll be on probably 2:00pm onward est,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Got my pin! That was super fast,RonInDune,1
"what's a good light level to be at for the raid? I want to start running it soon, but I also don't want to be a burden to everyone haha",link270,1
Like 930-940ish,Crizum,1
"Nice, just hit 930",link270,1
"damn everybody's climbing, I'm still like 920 lol",Trissin,1
"Nah you have midterms and such, focus on those. Destiny will be here no matter what",RonInDune,1
"Unless the world ends tomorrow, in which case oh well",RonInDune,1
hahaha tru,Trissin,1
"but little did u know, midterms and other exams are **also here no matter what**",Trissin,1
I swear I've had at least 1 midterm or significant test every week for the last like 5 weeks,Trissin,1
oof,RonInDune,1
I spent 4 hours today proctoring two tests and I'm dreading having to grade them lol,RonInDune,1
"us students complain about midterms and evaluations and such, but I can't even imagine having to grade them",Trissin,1
that sounds like so much work,Trissin,1
"I finally finished most of my midterms and get my day of fall break today, so I'll be on a bit this weekend.",link270,1
Piotr Jabłoński published part of his art from Grimoire Volume II: https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qAXdlz,RonInDune,1
It's pretty good!,RonInDune,1
"For anyone going for the vanguard shaders and emblems, the five of swords strikes work for it, but you can’t put on brawler or grenadier anymore. Shouldn’t be a problem if you have any weapons with demolitionist or a Monte Carlo",Crizum,1
wait what,Trissin,1
no more brawler/grenadier on the challenge card???,Trissin,1
They took out literally every positive modifier from 5 of swords,Oathbreaker,1
Yuuuuup,Arixama,1
Probably to stop the farming,Arixama,1
Which is really dumb if you ask me,Oathbreaker,1
You don't get any good loot other than strike loot,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah it won’t help the score portion, but I’m at like 75% for solar ability kills and done with the other two so rather than fight two others for kills just load up a solo strike. Though I guess you could just melee with an empty sword during the 950 nightfall",Crizum,1
love when all I wanted to do was play some d2 tonight but we get stuck with mandatory recovery :))),thegoaliebear,1
"Feel your pain. Gotta get up at 6 and work til prob 8pm tomorrow. But gotta get that green, nah mean? But its chill. Today was a great day to get stuff done and now relax. Plenty of destiny tomorrow night and sunday 👍",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
yeah i should probably start writing my essay tomorrow lol. crank out a draft of it after my game. sunday will be a destiny day tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't know what mandatory recovery is, but it's good you're getting rested!",RonInDune,1
haha no we had to stay at the rink an extra hour when we could have already been home and sleeping lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
it was awesome.,thegoaliebear,1
What the heck I just realized there's a new strike on Io,RonInDune,1
When did that happen ??!!??,RonInDune,1
eris narrates it so shadowkeep,Buttkikker,1
I had no idea somehow dang,RonInDune,1
welp I've been above 950 for a few days now and I'd like to do the raid but haven't really had the time to do it,Chance,1
is anyone wanting to do the raid and/or guide me and my friend through it,Chance,1
sometimes this weekend probably,Chance,1
i know lots of us are always down to help with a raid if the time works out. we have a full run on sunday but worth seeing if people are available tomorrow maybe.,thegoaliebear,1
tomorrow would be good,Chance,1
"i would definitely like to join, but it would be my first time and i need an adult to go with me",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
^^ but since challenge mode is gone i dont imagine it'll be that hard,Chance,1
I'd be down for anytime this weekend.,LW Mugetsu,1
Would anyone be interested in a heroic menagerie run tomorrow night? Possibly for flawless boss but mostly for catalyst. It’s great to have in the new raid.,Waffles,1
":S had to stay late as well, didn't get to log on",Trissin,1
"I'm always down to sherpa raids, but I'm away this weekend for a competition",Trissin,1
life always getting in the way of a good time 😉,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
right?? :((,Trissin,1
"what kind of competition, if you don't mind me asking?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Ofc, no worries! An archery tournament against another university",Trissin,1
"Not big or anything significant, more of like a friendly shoot",Trissin,1
but standard rules and stuff still apply,Trissin,1
awesome 😄 i'm a bow hunter and have always loved archery! never done it competitively but i know taking 100 shots a day takes some working up to lol.  Seems there's a specific muscle in the shoulder that only gets used when drawing a bow.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
@Waffles i would love to but i only have 2/4 keys in the mysterious box at this point.  I'll make a hell of an effort tomorrow to get IB and hopefully go with you,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"time for bed though, g'nite yall",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Night!!,Trissin,1
IT. IS. DONEEEE.,Lonk,1
he was up until almost 5am grinding this thing,Rye,1
lmao,Rye,1
Gratz!,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
i would never have that much resolve with pvp lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear was me, him and a few others that were playing pvp",Rye,1
started to get like 11% per game with fusion rifles,Rye,1
wish i had the time of day.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Waffles don’t know what I was thinking last night, can’t do 2 diff forges in one day and therefore can’t have the IB to join you.  Speaking of forges, I thought they were supposed to rotate each day; is that not true anymore?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
each week i believe.,thegoaliebear,1
"They should be daily, in about 13 minutes it should switch",Crizum,1
but you also don't need izanagis to do heroic menagerie. can just do it for funsies now that we aren't under the level.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah kinda just want the catalyst for GoS,Waffles,1
coming from someone who never even bothered to get the gun in the first place lol...not necessary 😂,thegoaliebear,1
but heroic menagerie is fun. if we can get a full team I'd hop on tonight for that.,thegoaliebear,1
Awesome!! Hopefully we can,Waffles,1
"@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) until you can get Izanagi’s if you want you can farm the moon sniper rifle Tranquility, it can roll with firing line",Crizum,1
@Crizum apparently izanagi's questline is fixed now,Rye,1
dunno for sure,Rye,1
"Hopefully yeah, but I just mean if he can’t get it today and needed something for the slot for whatever reason, it also frees up an exotic spot",Crizum,1
ye,Rye,1
"Good news, everyone! Got off work early so will probably run some quests/pvp in a bit. Would like to do a nightfall at 950 100% and maybe try 980. My drops are at 950 now but I still know that’s a stretch",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"Prob want to finish Exit Strategy as well and then vex incursion triumph memes too. Basically, feel free to add me on steam and msg if you wanna play if you see me on soon.",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Might stream as well,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"I just saw this

Id still recommend Izanagi's, other snipers are also good but I think Izanagi's is noticeably better",Trissin,1
Oh I love Izanagi’s but talking to @thegoaliebear about it is like this scene,Crizum,1
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pubd-spHN-0,Crizum,1
"Izanagis also occupies your kinetic slot, leaving your energy open to recluse or whatever you wanna run in that slot, I don't know what you like",rozak,1
"otherwise you can get tranq, or farm a good Sole Survivor which can also roll firing line",rozak,1
in case you wanted to run something like riskrunner,Chance,1
you could run tranq with it,Chance,1
izanagis is a slap machine tho,Chance,1
"I haven’t run it yet but I just got a love and death with spike grenades and full court, no auto-loading but it’ll be nice to not need orbs for wendigo",Crizum,1
I’ll see how it fares in garden tomorrow,Crizum,1
very nice,Buttkikker,1
anyone down for raid???,Chance,1
@Destiny [PC],Chance,1
old raids too even,Chance,1
any,Chance,1
raiders in the chat,Chance,1
Not home or would go for one of the shorter ones,Crizum,1
I was hoping to do nightfall at 100k,Kronohs,1
Maybe 920,Kronohs,1
well I've been doing just fine without izanagis lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
but do we have anyone who would want to do heroic menagerie tonight aside from me and @Waffles ? @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
@Kronohs you can't get 100k at 920 unfortunately,rozak,1
some say im religious,Chance,1
some would say im an anglo shaxxon,Chance,1
@rozak oh really? That sucks. I got to 93k once and thought it was doable,Kronohs,1
we were cutting it close at 103k in a 950,Chance,1
"Chance, you wouldn’t happen to be a big Michael Shaxxon fan would you?",Crizum,1
yes,Chance,1
@thegoaliebear I'm down for heroic menagerie. Is it any different from regular menagerie besides difficulty?,Peronix,1
I need to do the heroic,Kit,1
Ok anyone down for legend nightfall & 950?,Kronohs,1
I could go for the 950 if we can find one more,Crizum,1
Awesome! Any other takers?,Kronohs,1
I can do it.,Infernosi,1
Nice!,Kronohs,1
I'll probs be on around 9:30 est for heroic menagerie.,thegoaliebear,1
hopped in to ft alpha chat @Kronohs,Crizum,1
gotta love iron banner,Buttkikker,1
going against a 5 stack with 2 unbrokens,Buttkikker,1
imagine not having a life.,thegoaliebear,1
I like how you need to play 50 gambit matches to get the Eriana's Wow catalyst then having the catalyst itself require 1 k kills.,CrizMobius,1
: ),Chance,1
i heard you like grinds,Chance,1
haha just kill me already,CrizMobius,1
the catalyst perks are nice and all but fuck is that a rediculous grind,Chance,1
"On a positive note tho, managed to get both exit startegy and hush in 50 gambit matches",CrizMobius,1
ima flex real quick,Buttkikker,1
got erianas catalyst,Buttkikker,1
👀,Chance,1
@Buttkikker nice 😄,CrizMobius,1
did you sell your soul,Chance,1
whats a soul,Buttkikker,1
all i have is destiny,Buttkikker,1
though big applause to all who have randys,Buttkikker,1
this sucks,Buttkikker,1
"Yeah I suffered through Randy’s first, makes everything else seem easy",Crizum,1
"I'm down for menagerie if you want a noob 🙂 still working on getting IB but i haven't done any raids in the game so far.  I'll look up a video on heroic menagerie and make sure i've got the gear for it... cancel that, i've done menagerie lol, just not heroic",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
it's not hard at all especially since we're all well over level for it.,thegoaliebear,1
"well, fair warning, i died quite a bit my first time in there.. went in total green",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
it's fine not like we're going for flawless lol. but i will be on maybe closer to 10 est. have a teammates birthday to go to for a bit.,thegoaliebear,1
"cool cool, i'll get the applicable clan bounties now and be round doin stuff and things till then",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
welp i guess i might as well run my titan and warlock through shadowkeep at this point,Chance,1
got nothing better to do,Chance,1
ITS DONE,Buttkikker,1
RANDYS IS DONE,Buttkikker,1
IM NEVER PLAYING CRUCIBLE AGAIN,Buttkikker,1
*Randy's grasp loosens...until next season*,Peronix,1
May have miscalculated how long i would be stayong at this party.,thegoaliebear,1
Party > Destiny,RonInDune,1

still debating whether I'm gonna go out or not haha.,thegoaliebear,1

"All good, I’m not home yet",Waffles,1
I swear to drunk officer I'm not God,Oathbreaker,1

well if i don't go out...drunk destiny is always fun.,thegoaliebear,1
seriously though Party > Destiny,Oathbreaker,1
For like 85% of the time,Oathbreaker,1
Did you say drunk sparrow racing?,Waffles,1
"When you're old and decrepit and decaying into sand, Destiny will still be there, but parties won't",RonInDune,1
drunk raid,Chance,1
drunk raid would be hilarious,Oathbreaker,1
take a shot every wipe anyone?,Oathbreaker,1
drunk raid pls,thegoaliebear,1
i just want to friggin raid but drunk raid would be great,Chance,1
all the alcohol in my apt won't drink itself.,thegoaliebear,1
Unfortunately I can't join in the drinking but I can be the chaperone!,RonInDune,1
some people say we have a drinking problem but i think people just have a problem with our drinking,Chance,1
All my raids are drunk raids,Crizum,1
be my desigbated driver  @RonInDune,thegoaliebear,1
But what raid and when is this happening lol,Waffles,1
I always am lol!!,RonInDune,1
last wish,thegoaliebear,1
Haha 😂,Waffles,1
Remind me to record everything and play it back at the most important moments of your lives,RonInDune,1
So..... I'm hearing drunk raid stream /s,Oathbreaker,1
i once made myselg black out from playing destiny after drinking too much at pregamd.,thegoaliebear,1
did i still go out?,thegoaliebear,1
absolutely.,thegoaliebear,1
"i'm in full party mode myself, and because i'm decrepit and decaying, party mode consists of an energy drink, and townhouse crackers with philly buffalo dip AND spinach artichoke.  Livin on the wild side",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
very wilds.,thegoaliebear,1
2 down,Arixama,1
im almost done with my exit strat,Chance,1
9% to go on the score,Chance,1
I was grinding for malfeasance and just happen to almost finish it,Chance,1
The only things i need for undying now are leviathans breath and to kill the undying mind 3 times,Buttkikker,1
"i need randy's and to finish the vangaurd quest, plus those 2 things",Arixama,1
!lfg search,Nahkriin,1
i wanna go for the garden of salvation seal,Spitfire2266,1
that title is all kinds of wack.,thegoaliebear,1
i dont even care too much for the vanguard one and ill get randy's eventually,Chance,1
if i ever use a scout rifle,Chance,1
likely will just be Undying for me this season.,thegoaliebear,1
randys looks so good,Spitfire2266,1
im hyped for it,Spitfire2266,1
i never want to play vex offensive again,Spitfire2266,1
or a bow,Spitfire2266,1
"heheh, it takes some determination that's for sure.  I've got about 2/3 of auto and fusion to go in offensive.  just got telesto and was like ""sweet, this is gonna make the fusion multikills so much easier"" and just like that, no it's not 😛",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
i will be alive for this lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
still hangin in there huh?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
lol yeah I'm really more tired than anything.,thegoaliebear,1
"i feel ya, energy drink has lost it's perks, dip is back in the fridge... close to wrapping up the red war legacy campaign though 🙂 kinda crappy there's no exotic rewards in it, but i really enjoy the story, and I'm now in love with Cayde as well.  TBH I wanted to know why Cayde is so beloved more than anything",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
he also had a lot of involvement in d1 with the story arcs. developed his character pretty well.,thegoaliebear,1
"wow, so there's even deeper history! I thought these characters were all D2... kinda bummed i missed out on D1 now",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
haha yeah it's all carried over from d1.,thegoaliebear,1
we have several lore geeks here and many story arcs we have now were started even way back in D1Y1.,thegoaliebear,1
"wish i had started this game sooner, it's got a really good mix of pvp, pve, and mmo elements.  I'm starting to geek on the lore too",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"you can get sucked into the world very easily for sure. i legit have like, an emotional attachment to my hunter😂",thegoaliebear,1
"oh yeah, he may not say much, but I'm pretty proud of my warlock at this point.  not gonna lie, i put on some shaders and spend an awkward amount of time thinking to myself how badass he looks",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Making your Guardian look badass is the true endgame,Peronix,1
"i've got a bit to go on that one lol, stats rule and can't be too picky. I've seen some really cool stuff on others though, and look forward to it",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Stats? What are those? Cooler it looks, the better it is, right?😂",Peronix,1
you might be able to get away with it but i need my +3 mobility so i can make it to the nearest titan and beg them to make the bad guys go away,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"""do the punchy thing, do the punchy thing!""",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
*Bubble please!*,Peronix,1
You absolute madlad!,Peronix,1
got bored,Buttkikker,1
Besides GoS there really isnt too much to do,Buttkikker,1
and besides GoS i don't have time for much else today :/,thegoaliebear,1
hoping this week will be a bit lighter on the school work. we have a road trip to Princeton so i won't be on thursday-saturday. but would be nice to have all of sunday to grind out some stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
Speaking of GoS I can be on whenever if people wanted to start earlier,Crizum,1
7 is likely the earliest i could be on.,thegoaliebear,1
i don't mind starting earlier if people can. just gives us more time to get the clear lol. I'd definitely like to do another run after tho maybe on my titan.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah would be nice, also sucks you actually do need a flawless run for the title haha",Crizum,1
Yeah I got my Hunter to 956 last night so i'm down for two runs,RonInDune,1
my titan is like...922 i think? but with transferring weapons he can be ~930 so he would be fine for a second run.,thegoaliebear,1
It's crazy how fast levelling is if one character is 950 plus,RonInDune,1
i also don't think i'll be going for the raid title this season. unfortunately just do not have the time to dedicate to those triumphs this time around.,thegoaliebear,1
I probably won't be on tonight due to a surprise visit from family. Sorry guys!,Peronix,1
@Chance and I have a great need to do vault of grass before the reset,rozak,1
no worries.,thegoaliebear,1
Does the menagerie give powerful drops anymore?,RonInDune,1
i don't believe so. but i think it will drop at your PL.,thegoaliebear,1
so it's still useful to round out a slot that might be dipping behind.,thegoaliebear,1
Hmm yeah that's what I wanted to do. Thanks!,RonInDune,1
yeah if i can get on before the raid tonight i will do that as well. it is so nice to be able to curate what you get haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Also buying silver on steam is a bit finicky,RonInDune,1
I keep getting errors,RonInDune,1
"Reload the game and see if it worked, or if you got charged for it.",Infernosi,1
"When I bought silver, Steam was saying that it didn't work, but I got charged for it and the silver was on my account",Infernosi,1

@Lonk peronix might not be able to make our GoS run tonight so we may need someone to jump in. you have first alt spot so lmk if you'll be available just in case!,thegoaliebear,1
okay i'm at 4/5 pages for this essay i'll finish that shit tomorrow 😂,thegoaliebear,1
"@Buttkikker would you mind being my sherpa, or is this a fast run (assuming you aren't needed in main raid)?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
or is that main raid?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Just a casual run i need to learn it myself so youre welcome to join,Buttkikker,1
woot 😄,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"@thegoaliebear yeah i should be free, but if it goes over 4 hours I’d need to leave",Lonk,1
i won't stay on that late either lol. we should be able to make it through tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"Are we still on for our raid tonight? That's at......8 est right? Is the play to ONLY do the 4th encounter (i would be totally cool with that), or are we doing the 4th encounter THEN doing a divinity run?",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"I don't have a second character to make the drops worthwhile after we finish the first run. Personally, I would be appreciative of just nailing down that 4th encounter and then giving new dry runs next with w/ divinity, w/ other classes.....etc",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
my plans drastically changed today and i am only now just getting on so I still haven't done divinity quest 😦,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"You should have time, I think the goal is finish the last encounter and do a new run on some peoples alts while  triggering divinity",Crizum,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
for everyone who is wanting to do the other GoS lfg go ahead and hop in to the raid chat and we'll see if we can get this going,Buttkikker,1
you mean vault of grass,Chance,1
@here anyone else interested in a GoS run?,Buttkikker,1
@rozak WHERE ARE YOU,Chance,1
Wait the raid tonight isn't just a standard run? It's a boss checkpoint and then divinity run?,Lonk,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
👀,Lonk,1
We're starting in an hour right?,RonInDune,1
yup.,thegoaliebear,1
I thought it was a fresh standard run so if you can get either other alts to fill in that'd be cool but if you really need someone I can do the first boss rush,Lonk,1
it looks like buttkikker is still an alt. still unsure of peronix's status but i'll let you know what ends up happening.,thegoaliebear,1
I am not gonna be able to get divinity quest done in time rip,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
i don't mind starting like 8:15 ish if needed.,thegoaliebear,1
messing around with stream things,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
don't you have to kill a lot of vex? literally haven't started,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

@Lonk it looks like we'll need one more. would you want to join?,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] need one more for boss encounter of GoS. just doing the boss so experience preferred for this.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'd join in, but I don't have experience with that one. And I heard it's a bitch and a half",the_drake1997,1
we can have you on a motes team it is simple enough. and you are leveled fine for it.,thegoaliebear,1

@LW Mugetsu any interest in doing final boss of GoS?,thegoaliebear,1
"If y'all still need one more person, I'll be back sooner than expected (around 10 minutes), if that's cool",Peronix,1
Yeah still have a spot,Crizum,1

Thanks again for the GoS clear tonight fam. Was really wanting that after missing out last week. And great job! That was very clean,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
of course👍 was good to get another clear in. I'll set up an lfg tomorrow for tuesday night. maybe we can get the whole run in and get divinity.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tomorrow night. will be getting divinity as well. experience not necessary we can teach the raid but at least have watched a video of the encounters if you join!,thegoaliebear,1

That dude has the largest of testicles,Crizum,1
He harbors an immense power I don’t want to face,Crizum,1
he was so ... shiny,RonInDune,1
finally finished revoker,Arixama,1
im pissed. We got the last boss of the raid down to like 1% or even less hp last night,Chance,1
never got to finish it,Chance,1
im determined to kill this finicky asshole of a boss,Chance,1
could someone please tell me who in the right mind decided to make the portals for the boss spawn relative to the bosses position? I can't tell you how many portals spawned BEHIND him best he was turn to the side,Chance,1
"rip, I feel u Chance",Trissin,1
Or could someone tell me why the tether mechanic so so damn finicky? Why can we just target who we want the tether to go to. Love wiping because the tether decide to go into africa,Chance,1
OR could someone tell me why theres essentially a time limit to depositing motes before the dps phase,Chance,1
if the dps phase starts and you try to deposit motes it wont fill,Chance,1
"Wasn't quite as low as your ~1% but i definitely agree with some of your other points, they frustrated me on day 1",Trissin,1
once i get home Im gunna see if i can find a group for it and try a  different strat,Chance,1
"portal spawn rng is a bit annoying, and the tether behaving weirdly is also just confusing",Trissin,1
I just dont understand why they kept it like that,Chance,1
For the dps phase thing all I can offer is don’t kill the angelic until people are banked,Crizum,1
it makes the boss unreasonably difficult,Chance,1
"as for the motes thing, I think it sorta makes sense
a timer pushes your team to work quickly so you can't take your sweet time",Trissin,1
and if you can't deposit during DPS phase maybe it's the angelic? but other than that idk,Trissin,1
its odd idk I know we had enough right when dps phase started but the tether just didnt work. and the text notification didnt pop when we banked,Chance,1
also it seems like the tether doesnt work when you take damage either,Chance,1
which is also really dumb,Chance,1
Goblins can sacrifice and pull motes out,Crizum,1
"I've only done the boss once, and I did with with some folks here in our clan

but we also saw some weird stuff, like floors going invisible, people's characters freaking out and like vibrating",Trissin,1
we had to back to orbit and go back,Trissin,1
its a fairly buggy raid,Avenged,1
^^^,Trissin,1
"Which blows but that’s probably what happened, they don’t have to finish sacrificing just starting it is enough",Crizum,1
OH we had the weirdest stuff happen to,Chance,1
i dunno abou that one @Crizum,Trissin,1
I think they do have to finish,Trissin,1
my friend randomly just died instantly and his body flew to space and his revive was back at the banner location,Chance,1
we were like halfway through the fight too when that happened,Chance,1
it made no sense,Chance,1
might've been land being taken/recovered,Trissin,1
"or going invisible, as it does sometimes",Trissin,1
idk,Trissin,1
it's wack,Trissin,1
we also had an issue where we reached dps phase and I think someone accidently hit one of the portal spots and it put a portal on top of one of the platforms you need to connect the tether to the box,Chance,1
"we had people going underground the map on my first run, and we were power-checked",flipd,1
so it teleported me away,Chance,1
lots of glitches,flipd,1
that encounter is just wack,Chance,1
"Oh man haha, yeah we had to have goal not use tether cause if the boss got too close he’d have both portals come out which we only realized once two cyclops came to the party",Crizum,1
"Tethers are super wonky, they will always prioritize people over where you want them to actually go, ricochet rounds seem to proc them a bunch",Crizum,1
"you might also get a bug where it just straight up ignores you. you could be the only one standing there, and the cube/tethered players just dont tether to you",Trissin,1
yikes I really dont think bungie dedicated enough time to these mechanics,Chance,1
they're far too finicky,Chance,1
My favorite was the boss T posing for a solid minute before registering as dead,Crizum,1
"I mean, the boss encounter is a bit buggy, yeah, but I think overall the raid is actually quite good",Trissin,1
every raid has had it's problems,Trissin,1
something else I've been wondering too since I kinda quit for a while after curse of osiris is what is with bungies obsession with parkour? It's kind weird having to do an obstacle course between encounters in a raid,Chance,1
leviathan didn't have that at all unless you're doing keys in the underbelly,Chance,1
the lair did tho,Chance,1
because jumping puzzles are the true endgame,Trissin,1
"I like it, makes it more engaging than “walk from room to room killing”",Crizum,1
I mean I do enjoy watching the people who cant parkour fall to their death a bunch of times,Chance,1
: ),Chance,1
They had it in vault to an extent and in Kings fall,Crizum,1
Actually I think leviathan is the only outlier really,Crizum,1
so it seems,Chance,1
i just realized i never got to finish the last encounter of crown either,Chance,1
zzz,Chance,1
i would raid and sherpa a lot more if i werent so busy gahhhhh,Trissin,1
"I want to do garden a lot more, for the weapons + armor",Trissin,1
I think I need to be sherpa'd though. I feel like the loadouts/strats for the encounters are probably very different from whatever wack stuff my team did on day 1,Trissin,1
I just want enhanced mods again dammit.,Oathbreaker,1
saladins handing them out like candy,Arixama,1
Oh I'm aware,Oathbreaker,1
Just being potato light level means I don't want to touch IB with a 10ft pole,Oathbreaker,1
didnt they fix the map rotation of IB it doesnt seem like it,Chance,1
i only played a few more though since it's kinda buttcheeks,Chance,1
@Oathbreaker if you can find two others to do it the 920/950 ordeal nightfalls drop those at a decent rate as well,Crizum,1
"sorry i had to bounce last night @Chance , wish i could've been there we so would've gotten it in the first try 😉 wife and i have a little one on the way and morning sickness has been plaguing her.  I try to make things easier on her when i can and she had to be up pretty early today so i called it a night.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
no worries m8 we all got a life that takes priority over bideo games,Chance,1
but man was that boss frustrating,Chance,1
it does... stupid life,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"sounds like it, can't wait to bang my head against that wall lol",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Hats off to those going for worlds 1st in that place... man, going in blind and figuring out all those tethering mechanics and team splits on the fly is pretty friggen impressive",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
@Destiny [PC] anyone in here want to do the last encounter of the raid? I have a grudge to settle,Chance,1
"afraid i'm busy with assignments atm, but best of luck! give the boss a good thrashing for me as well please",Trissin,1
doing quest for thorn atm,Rye,1
!lfg search,Arixama,1
"lol @Arixama I rewatched the end of that game where my bounty didn't complete, and I was tilted lmao",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
and sleepy,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
welp i found a squad and we beat his ass first try,Chance,1
we had some odd glitches going on though but we still managed to down him,Chance,1
almost one phased him too,Chance,1
yeah he can be a bit glitchy. we've had that happen on a number of boss attempts. but nice job on the clear.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1

"My biggest fear rn is the Leviathan's Breath quest involving a ""final blows in Crucible with bow"" step",Peronix,1
Oh god don’t fucking say that PLEASE,rozak,1
"I wouldn't mind that, I like my lemon. Those who played clan matches with me a while back might remember lol",Trissin,1
it doesn't. quest steps were leaked i can try and find the link. even tho it's not 100% confirmed the steps are too indicative of it being leviathans breath.,thegoaliebear,1
it's bow kills in gambit or strikes i believe.,thegoaliebear,1
inb4 it becomes entirely pvp as datamining punishment,Arixama,1
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.pcgamesn.com/destiny-2/leviathans-breath-quest-steps%3famp,thegoaliebear,1
nah.,thegoaliebear,1
Calus loves us too much to make us play pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
not even kills in a specific activity. only bow kills are precision kills against cabal and vex. last step is a remastered arms dealer strike.,thegoaliebear,1
Still not celebrating until we see the steps. Remember “solar week”?,Crizum,1
Then again everyone using bows in crucible would probably be hilarious,Crizum,1
it's possible some things could be different. but doubt it'll have much if any involvement in pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
"Honestly, if it involves bows in PvP, I just won't get it. simple as that.",Oathbreaker,1
randys was enough to force people back into pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
I don't even enjoy bows as a weapon type (not that they should be removed from the game or anything) but I just can't enjoy them at all,Oathbreaker,1
a heavy bow might turn out to be fun. doubt it'll have much use in endgame stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
Le Monarque is pretty enjoyable,Crizum,1
"The use is spelled out in the perk, good against unstoppable champions",Crizum,1
So if they have barrier and unstoppable you’ll probably be using it with anti-barrier recluse,Crizum,1
"See.... they're slow, unwieldy snipers that have draw time *and* aren't hitscan. I'd much rather just have a sniper in both PvP and PvE",Oathbreaker,1
mhm...theres definitely niche uses for them which is nice. but overall they're just pretty underwhelming compared to the other stuff we have.,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't think you can put mods on exotics though, can you?",Trissin,1
"I don't think bows are *good* necessarily, but they feel perfect to use for me somehow",RonInDune,1
"No, it’s part of its package",Crizum,1
ohhh mbmb,Trissin,1
Might just be a bUngie thing,RonInDune,1
In the same way Divinity disrupts haha,Crizum,1
"Divinity does work on overload champions, people tend to forget those exist in the nightfalls I run and they just go crazy on people",Crizum,1
"So if we have a hive nightfall with Unstoppable Ogres that’s the use for Leviathans Breath. Which is cool, I think they realize if they have godlike exotics that just becomes the meta, so spreading a few of them out over more niche uses ensures people play around with them",Crizum,1
Can’t boss burn with Izanagi’s times 3 if you need to cover the various champions,Crizum,1
yeah honestly i like that. it makes you need to have a more optimized team for certain activities.,thegoaliebear,1
Y'all let me know how the quest is once it comes out,Trissin,1
lmao i wish i could. I'll probs have just enough time to get it started before the raid.,thegoaliebear,1
I got class at 2 so,Oathbreaker,1
No quest for me,Oathbreaker,1
Is divinity still busted against the raid boss?,Arixama,1
Busted how?,Crizum,1
Gives it increased armor so you actually do less damage. I think that's what the problem was,Arixama,1
"Oh wow haha have no idea, Ron was using it on our run so hopefully not",Crizum,1
idk considering we damaged over half his health first phase i couldn't tell ya 🤔 😜,thegoaliebear,1
well my 1230 class was cancelled so i can at least pick up the leviathans breaths quest before my next class lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Not sure if it’s cause we won, but one gambit prime match got us 35% on that quest step",Crizum,1
any nightfall is 50%,RonInDune,1
Oh nice,Crizum,1
i'm hopping on real quick now to grab the quest. where exactly do i go in the tower to get it?,thegoaliebear,1
Gambit is also 2% on erianas bow so double dipping,Crizum,1
"At Banshee, after that go to the hanger",Crizum,1
👍,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah a loss is 25%,Crizum,1
so what i'm getting is that step goes real quick.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, and so far lines up with the data mined info",Crizum,1
Haha you can’t type Tangled Shore?,Crizum,1
If you type in tangled shore it’s shows up tangled s****,Crizum,1
oh bloody hell,RonInDune,1
that's incredibly funny lol,RonInDune,1
Also typing trigger it shows up tr***,Crizum,1
I didn’t realize profanity filter was set to auto on so I turned it off,Crizum,1
I also apparently glitched Hawthorne and she is at 40% for my weekly and I’m capped on her xp,Crizum,1
ok got to the bow precision kills step so not bad.,thegoaliebear,1
if i can hop on before the raid i'll get that step going if not i'll just do it tomorrow.,thegoaliebear,1
"Big brain, the raid is all vex and that step is vex or cabal",Crizum,1
Anyone acquired the weapon yet? please tell me how it feels,Trissin,1
Streamers did it on Nessus lost sectors,RonInDune,1
On the strike step currently,Crizum,1
Oh shit it matchmakes,Crizum,1
yeah i was thinking of just farming out the nessus lost sector in artifacts edge...figured the quest would be relatively short considering they released it later into the season.,thegoaliebear,1
Still have necrophage too,Crizum,1
"hitting crits on Vex is a right pain, the Cistern with its Cabal are another option",RonInDune,1
"I just loaded up the leviathan, endless cabals",Crizum,1
if it's not needed for a title i want then i don't worry about it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
wait wait wait,Buttkikker,1
divinity gives it armor???,Buttkikker,1
yeah its bugged.,thegoaliebear,1
DAMIT,Buttkikker,1
"Wait, I thought it just lowered the crit modifier",Trissin,1
@Chance we could have done it that one run,Buttkikker,1
IT HAD LIKE 1% HP,Buttkikker,1
I know that feels,Trissin,1
rip that run,Buttkikker,1
well time to grind for bow,Buttkikker,1
that run was rip,rozak,1
we got our kill last night tho,rozak,1
This bow is pretty nice,Crizum,1
Think I’ll run in it garden tonight and see how it feels,Crizum,1
"The Divinity bug isn't confirmed, especially in GoS",RonInDune,1
sanct is definitely fine,rozak,1
think at this point dps in garden isn't an issue anyways lol.,thegoaliebear,1
but i guess I'll find out when i use a linear fusion bad boy against the sanctified mind tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
i really love the feel of leviathans breath,Arixama,1
Reddit's complaining that it one shots everything in PvP but is kinda meh in PvE?,RonInDune,1
reddit's always complaining,Arixama,1
Truest words ever spoken,RonInDune,1
I'm glad it's a good bow though,RonInDune,1
"OMG, i've been training for this moment for all my... past week and a half!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"For PvP it’s a heavy, most heavies one shot haha",Crizum,1
“This fucking wardcliff kills me in my super? What garbage”,Crizum,1
its kinda lame in pve,Rye,1
"of course its going to one shot in pvp, its pretty much the same damage archetype as a rocket launcher",Arixama,1
"We’ll see more testing come out I’m sure, but the only way it feels lacking to me is when you compare it to Izanagi, but that’s taking in to account a catalyst honed edge shot",Crizum,1
So I was watching people run heroic menagerie and 3 people got hive armaments in one flawless run,RonInDune,1
They might've buffed drop rates,RonInDune,1
oooo,Buttkikker,1
interesting,Buttkikker,1
i need the sword anyways,Buttkikker,1
Also the strat seemed pretty safe,RonInDune,1
which boss is it this week?,thegoaliebear,1
big flying vex guy,RonInDune,1
in the raid starting chamber,RonInDune,1
oh that one is easy for flawless.,thegoaliebear,1
just need to be on top of those cyclops.,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't know if flawless if even difficult anymore, considering we can be like 950",Trissin,1
it might scale you down but i honestly don't know lol. i'd imagine it's hella easy now tho.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah it seems way less stressful now,RonInDune,1
the ogre took me a couple tries,Trissin,1
regular menagerie is still actually kind of difficult depending on modifiers.,Arixama,1
"also as far as mods go, since theyre unlocks now theres only so many runs you have to do to get the mod you want",Arixama,1
regular menagerie difficulty is proportional to how bad your randos are,Chance,1

@Destiny [PC] anyone in here wanna do a crown of sorrow run,Chance,1

either of you?,Arixama,1

"Guys, if you can, finish the ""Last Days on Kraken Mare"" lore book",RonInDune,1

I swear he triggered the tethers by himself,Crizum,1
LOOL,Trissin,1
It’s the only explanation,Crizum,1
he hit the boxes,Buttkikker,1
it was weird,Buttkikker,1
Lmao he did,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Well done anyway, it's a tough raid!",RonInDune,1
"Like he fired a few shots at the boxes, fired at me, fired and Rugged, and fired at the boxes again",Crizum,1
"seriously big congrats, it is indeed a tough raid",Trissin,1

very chonky,Trissin,1
Ty @Trissin I won’t soon forget that experience,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I thought the first three encounters were a bit wild the first time in there... I was not prepared,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

you shouldn't have a problem with the other raids,Trissin,1

this cleared a lot up. was running through the raids in my head trying to think of ribbons lol",Trissin,1
some of the old raid bosses can still feel pretty chonky because of the lunafaction/rally nerf,Chance,1
"that's true, yeah
val ca'uor comes to mind",Trissin,1
well I'm glad yall got divinity. sorry again for having to dip so suddenly...still getting over this cold.,thegoaliebear,1
but i do have a boss checkpoint if anyone would like to get an extra clear tonight @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
if not I'll just be grinding strikes.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm down. I got to flex on that boss and make up for *the years of therapy he's caused me*,Peronix,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ for tonight,thegoaliebear,1
"I wouldn't mind running the whole thing soon, need like 4 drops to get to 951",RonInDune,1
yeah i just want to get the clear tonight if possible. not a huge deal if i don't I'll just run strikes instead. but maybe Sunday i can get a full run for another character.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Arixama lmao, I totally imagined it was some kind of buff that looked like a ribbon that swirled around you and likely had to be cycled around the fire team to access different areas or take down elites. The Blueberry abides 😂",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
ok this festival of the lost set does look pretty cool,RonInDune,1
and the best sparrow,RonInDune,1
idk how i feel about that armor lol.,thegoaliebear,1
How could you suggest there exists a sparrow superior to the scooty puff,Trissin,1
It's terrible but amazingly terrible,RonInDune,1
Like watching The Room or something,RonInDune,1
i'm debating whether i want to grind strikes or randys tonight actually. that medals % is bugging me😬,thegoaliebear,1
"I stumbled across a short article about Randy’s and progress, don’t know if this is common knowledge now but here it is and it may help:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2019/10/21/heres-why-your-destiny-2-randys-throwing-knife-quest-is-taking-so-long/amp/",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I'll have to give that a read but yeah the quest is just way improperly balanced. i want to get my scout kills finished before i just focus on the medals.,thegoaliebear,1
TLDR he says doing rumble and rumble only and seeking cold fusion medals is making medals progress much faster,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
that's what I'll have to do once scout kills are finished. also need to finish out the glory points but I'm at 1650 so that won't be bad. I'd imagine rumble still has a fair amount of afkers ?,thegoaliebear,1
"i havent touched scouts much yet, and im done with the medals, i just ran 2 SMG peacekeepers and shredded people for the SMG medal",Gimmie2,1
"i think im at 8% on scout kills, maybe 9%",Gimmie2,1
"I'm at 80% on scout kills i get like, 3-6% per game so it's inconsistent but at least you're always making progress lol.",thegoaliebear,1
the medals is just ridiculous. make it all medals or specify which medals grant progress.,thegoaliebear,1
"yeah, i think ive done about 2-3 games focusing on scouts. i have a decent rolled gambit scout thats making it pretty easy",Gimmie2,1
i just went back to year 1 and using MIDA :derp:,thegoaliebear,1
still works haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Mida is still real good.,Gimmie2,1
9/10 fights where someone is trying to peek I'll win.,thegoaliebear,1
jade rabbit is king don't @ me,Trissin,1
i dont like how slow firing the rabbit is ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Gimmie2,1
^ same,thegoaliebear,1
it feels too clunky to me.,thegoaliebear,1
i like to *zoom*,thegoaliebear,1
^ 100 mobility or go home :wetLUL:,Gimmie2,1
yeah...think I'll go with randys grinding tonight haha. I'm almost done with the bosses and points for the vanguard emblem. at 16% on super/arc kills so that'll be a small grind but not too bad at all.,thegoaliebear,1
"if you have a titan, just run shoulder charge + skullfort makes those arc kills super fast",Gimmie2,1
yeah arcstrider was good too. one super got me 4% one strike. I'll definitely just end up farming those kills out on my titan that's what i did with the void ones.,thegoaliebear,1
oh so just checked Braytech...its 900 arc or super kills so no wonder arcstrider is so good haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Jade Rabbit is boss,Crizum,1
Stable as all hell,Crizum,1
"nah, black tiger/scorpion is the way to go",Arixama,1
i had black tiger as my alt scout haha. works real nice.,thegoaliebear,1
the fast fire also made it decent enough that i would get close range hip fire kills with it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I used the curated Vouchsafe for a bit and it was absolutely terrible,RonInDune,1
ouch lol.,thegoaliebear,1
there are some weapons i just questions why they exist.,thegoaliebear,1
that's one of them.,thegoaliebear,1
"I sometimes spend half the game using a scout (usually Talons of the Eagle), get extremely mad at my shite performance, pull out Blast Furnace/Jotunn and finally have fun",RonInDune,1
The only reason why I like jade rabbit and the night watch scout rifle is cause they have insane aim assist,RonInDune,1
of all the scouts in the game those are the only few with noticeable bend,RonInDune,1
those are the scouts with aim assist > 70,RonInDune,1
i honestly just got really good with MIDA bc of that year 1 meta. so I just feel so comfortable with it and it handles really well so i can still play fast with it.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah MIDA is one of those guns that feels perfect to use,RonInDune,1
So tight,RonInDune,1
"One of the best designed guns in the game, imo",RonInDune,1
for real. it's very good. it just feels so good to hit those headshots...people drop so fast haha.,thegoaliebear,1
It's the one gun that feels similar to the DMR from Halo,RonInDune,1
midas got an aim assist of 100 as well,Arixama,1
oof,RonInDune,1
One day I will get that catalyst,RonInDune,1
just gotta hit 5500 glory,Arixama,1
"i like how well it handles overall i think. the mobility boost and radar staying up makes it pretty busted, which is why you'll win so many peeking battles.",thegoaliebear,1
Do you run the MIDA smg as well?,RonInDune,1
sometimes. i usually forget about it bc of recluse tho haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"tru, I've never consistently run that SMG and don't really remember if it's any good",RonInDune,1
it's actually pretty decent.,thegoaliebear,1
"recoil is at 80 and recluse is 100, so that's where you'll feel the big difference. but it handles pretty well.",thegoaliebear,1
"I ran that combo early on and it’s still one of my favs, the mini tool feels weak though; like not enough punch. Maybe I’ve gotten used my riskrunner crutch too often (now recluse too lol)",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
yeah it's definitely outclassed by the other secondary smgs. i actually used the Calus Mini tool for a bit and might actually try for a good roll on it haha. it was pretty fun to use.,thegoaliebear,1
Do the Calus weapons give the right buff now? For both Drang and mini tool?,RonInDune,1
Calus really is our kindly old space Santa,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
"anyone want to lose their sanity in crucible with me in like, 15 mins?",thegoaliebear,1
also @RonInDune @Buttkikker we have 4 in the raid cp for sure so if you guys wanna get a boss clear in tonight then that would make a full group aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I should be able to,Buttkikker,1
"Sure why not, what was the time again",RonInDune,1
theres a slight chance ill be busy but i doubt it,Buttkikker,1
Buttkikker fucking loves this boss,Crizum,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
8:30 est @RonInDune so like about 3.5 hours from now.,thegoaliebear,1
ah that seems fine-ish,RonInDune,1
cool. if we have to start a bit later like 9 or something that's fine too it's just the cp won't take long.,thegoaliebear,1
"""wont take long""",Buttkikker,1
god i wish,Buttkikker,1
that boss is traumatizing,Buttkikker,1
"In my two clears,  one took ~ 8 hours cause I was 20 light below, but my 2nd went right first try I think",RonInDune,1
It's just very glitchy,RonInDune,1
its fun when it works,Buttkikker,1
when,Buttkikker,1
lol. yeah the bugginess of it can get frustrating but we all know what's going on so hopefully we don't get the short end of the stick.,thegoaliebear,1
the short end of the worlds shortest stick,Buttkikker,1
maybe a little salty...,Buttkikker,1
someone please join me at least in voice chat i cannot play this trash mode that is pvp,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg search,Buttkikker,1

can't.,thegoaliebear,1

By the end of the season @Buttkikker will truly be the most broken person,Crizum,1
the end?,Buttkikker,1
already am,Buttkikker,1
between randy's and the sanctified mind i'm dying,Buttkikker,1
randys will break me eventually.,thegoaliebear,1
I’m actually 1% away from Randy’s but I was too tired to finish last night had early morning lectures,Spitfire2266,1
i cranked out the last bit of glory i needed and went up to 34% on medals so now i can fuck around with jotunn.,thegoaliebear,1
I only played rumble for medals just camped with a fusion for the cold fusion medals,Spitfire2266,1
And camped heavy hard with 1k,Spitfire2266,1
are there still afkers in rumble? or do people actually try.,thegoaliebear,1
Not really,Spitfire2266,1
Everything is sweaty af,Spitfire2266,1
I had 3 quickplay games that were 150-149 2 days ago,Spitfire2266,1
bleh.,thegoaliebear,1
@link270 and I also want to do a divinity run soon. Still need to do the prereqs though,1minatur,1
For the first time in like 4 weeks i'm not drowning in work and assignments,Trissin,1
Is there a garden run going on tonight?,Trissin,1
mood.,thegoaliebear,1
lol,Trissin,1
If there's space i'll join up,Trissin,1
only one planned for sunday is full.,thegoaliebear,1
if not its cool,Trissin,1
but there could be one for tonight,Buttkikker,1
id be down,Buttkikker,1
!lfg create,Trissin,1
Do I hear flawless run?,Peronix,1
oh i aint good enough for flawless just yet,Trissin,1
i need to be sherpa'd through garden tbh,Trissin,1
i dont even know the meta,Trissin,1
revoker,Buttkikker,1
YA,thegoaliebear,1
QUOTE ME AGAIN,thegoaliebear,1
you forgot must have Revoker.,thegoaliebear,1
ah shit,Trissin,1
i dont have revoker,Trissin,1
i gotta remove myself now,Trissin,1
oh shit. exposed.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Trissin meta would be MT or Izanagi for first two encounters, just izanagi for third and fourth, recluse with anti-barrier rounds and Wendigo/Swarm/Love and Death spike launchers in the heavy slot, you could substitute 21% delirium in the heavy a lot for he first two encounters",Crizum,1
"Or, you could be goal and run Revoker/Darci",Crizum,1
if you're not a pussy you use Revoker and Darci,thegoaliebear,1
😜,thegoaliebear,1
If you don’t have revoker run any primary sniper with mulligan,Crizum,1
that too.,thegoaliebear,1
Mulligan and outlaw,Crizum,1
Nah meta is bottom tree void hunter with bows in every slot,RonInDune,1
Really rock the Tomb raider cosplay,RonInDune,1
Infinite cyclops is what they call that,Crizum,1
izanagi who ?? never heard of her.,thegoaliebear,1
"Hey Izanagi is Ada-1's favourite weapon, don't be dissing her",RonInDune,1
By favourite I mean the gun she used to kill her mother,RonInDune,1
"“Man that’s a sad ass backstory, you mind if I use this thing to chunk the Vex?”",Crizum,1
"“Thank you, Guardian, for proving me wrong” *Guardian proceeds to honed edge a Dreg and dab on it*",Crizum,1
I just ran into the weirdest fucking hacking,Chance,1
i've ever seen,Chance,1
in crucible,Chance,1
I wonder if it was the same dude we saw,Crizum,1
OH,thegoaliebear,1
this guy was teleporting everywhere and he would instantly respawn exactly where he died,Chance,1
YEAH I CLIPPED THAT GUY,thegoaliebear,1
"oh, I meant like strats wise",Trissin,1
wtf?,Chance,1
weapons are pretty clear lmao,Trissin,1
Oh. Strats are ez pz,Crizum,1
Yeah I saw a guy in Rumble who'd respawn instantly after death with overshield,RonInDune,1
when i get back on sunday I'll have to post those clips this guy was insane it was laughable.,thegoaliebear,1
I though it was a bug,RonInDune,1
the first time,RonInDune,1
I honestly thought he was lagging,Chance,1
then i realized he kept teleporting on people,Chance,1
so odd,Chance,1
I need to be off by 10ish est but if we are starting at 7:30 est I can run it with you guys if you need someone,Crizum,1
like look at the match results lma,Chance,1
"Yeah we had that too, the match began and he was at our spawn",Crizum,1
yo @Matos,Trissin,1
join us,Trissin,1
@Matos,Trissin,1
ill join you brothers,Chance,1
i just need to get caught up on the divinity quest,Chance,1
but i've cleared the raid,Chance,1
ayy nice yea join us,Trissin,1
we out here,rozak,1
@Peronix coming out of blue portal seeing the red floor like https://m.imgur.com/gallery/AQFRS2M,Crizum,1
"Can't trust nobody, not even the *F L O O R*",Peronix,1
By the way TWAB has been out for a bit and I really like the winners of the fashion contest,RonInDune,1
My personal faves are Danni's Warlock and TadsJr's Titan,RonInDune,1
"@Destiny [PC] Bungie confirmed you have until the end of the season to get the title Undying, can’t finish out collections at a later date",Crizum,1
what title,Rye,1
undying?,Rye,1
Correct,Crizum,1
yeah and any seasonal titles this year i would assume applies as well.,thegoaliebear,1
"so, i just need to crank out those medals next week and then do a master nightfall for the ship.",thegoaliebear,1
then it's just the undying mind kills.,thegoaliebear,1
Getting to 960+ helps out a lot on master,RonInDune,1
Can’t even do the mind kills until the 19th of November so you have some time,Crizum,1
And as much as you don’t want Izanagi’s running one or two of those with divinity makes the master nightfalls so much easier,Crizum,1
Slightly disappointed that all the fashion week winners are all character menu screenshots.,Arixama,1
Maybe bungie reached out to the players to get character menu screenshots,RonInDune,1
"And they've fixed the Izanagi bugs, now just grind bounties",RonInDune,1
@Crizum i'm still on the watcher lens part of that so I'm not gonna waste my time doing old stuff for something i don't even need.,thegoaliebear,1
enough people have it anyway.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah just run Divinity,Crizum,1
"But like weapons are as much a part of fashion as the rest of the pieces, and the character menu only displays primary weapons",Arixama,1
"and I'm not saying its not doable, just that its so much easier haha",Crizum,1
i think a master nightfall also depends which strike it is. even with the champions and stuff some are easier to handle than others. it's just a matter of getting randys done first for me.,thegoaliebear,1
"This week is savathuns song I think, so rip",Crizum,1
wasn't planning on doing it this week anyway lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I think savathun song is trash for it,Arixama,1
inverted spire is probably the best one for it,Crizum,1
Savathun's is really good for getting a 100K though,RonInDune,1
Yeah I agree with Crizum. Either that or Lake of Shadows,RonInDune,1
"or the one with Xol, that one isn't terrible",Crizum,1
yeah I'd say any strike where you can really burn down the boss is fine. but those that damage gate you constantly can get rough.,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] Any others for garden starting in ~ 10 - 15 min?,Trissin,1
I’m on,Crizum,1
So if Peronix is down we have a full run,Crizum,1
Sweet,Trissin,1
I can join but I've never done it before,Rye,1
@Rye go for it!,RonInDune,1
don't know if they want specifically people who know the mechanics,Rye,1
"It should be okay, I'm learning as well lol",Trissin,1
neat,Rye,1
It's a fairly good raid to learn,RonInDune,1
Oof I just went out 😂 I'd join otherwise,the_drake1997,1
Yeah I can explain,Crizum,1
Nothing can possibly go wrong,RonInDune,1
from what I've been told its like gambit but as a raid,Rye,1
at least some part of it,Rye,1
We'll explain that portion when we get there,Trissin,1
"It sounds complicated and confusing, but is pretty simple really",Arixama,1
"give me like 6 or 7 minutes, ill be on",Trissin,1
"'Nothing can possibly go wrong'
***tethers intensifies***",Peronix,1
Sent some friend requests so we can link up in orbit,Crizum,1
@thegoaliebear or @Arixama can you pin this I think it’s solid advice for garden of salvations final encounter,Crizum,1
Pinned a message.,thegoaliebear,1
im booting up destiny now ill be in voice chat in like 5 mins,Buttkikker,1
I’m mad lol,Crizum,1
Just one shot sanctified mind after ricochet rounds started it before we were done explaining it haha,Crizum,1
I'm very happy for y'all!,RonInDune,1
ez first try,Trissin,1
yeah i accidently pulled wiht ricochet rounds and we did it,Chance,1
ez,Chance,1
If there's another one planned soon I'll try to join in,RonInDune,1
@Rye hopefully it wasn’t too confusing haha,Crizum,1
it was ez,Rye,1
hardest part was the stupid tethers tbh,Rye,1
especially that hourglass one,Rye,1
The only encounter we didn’t one shot was the first lol,Crizum,1

alright i just need randy's and undying mind,Arixama,1
"protip, corrupted is a regular nightfall this week so you can just go into blind well and farm out ability kills using harmony",Arixama,1

I’m down,Rye,1
sweet.,thegoaliebear,1
i know its so late and no one wants to think of the place lol but can i get a few people to help me through the shattered throne to get an izanagis burden and wish ender? @Destiny [PC],the_drake1997,1

awesome! i'll make a post and @ you when i get it up! im thinking around 6 or 7ET that way you can still loose your sanity at 8 lolo,the_drake1997,1
that's not until sunday.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yea, I'm free anytime today, man!",Peronix,1
don't believe anything else is going on tonight anyway tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"oh damn, didnt see that. ok then 7 ET work?",the_drake1997,1
"Yea, that's cool",Peronix,1
Bot displays the localized date incorrectly on mobile at the bottom 🤣,Arixama,1

yeah it's annoying haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Xûr's selling Geomags and Liars Handshake, both really important exotics. Get em if you need em",RonInDune,1

"Also Synthoceps, but I think you get that from the campaign?",RonInDune,1
really?,Buttkikker,1
Not anymore I don’t think,Crizum,1
"My first response was ""what rolls?"" Lol",Trissin,1
You could get them before new light but I think they removed them,Crizum,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
Synthoceos from campaign? No,Trissin,1
Doom Fangs,Trissin,1
was it that part where you chose between 3,Buttkikker,1
i remember ac/dc feedback was there,Buttkikker,1
I believe the last was Actium?,Trissin,1
"no synthoceps, I'm p sure",Trissin,1
"Just looked it up, it was actium/feedback fence/doom fang",Crizum,1
I knew doomfang was on there,CrizMobius,1
Regardless I don’t think they give them out anymore?,Crizum,1
"That's what I heard as well, but I haven't played thru it to confirm",Trissin,1
Saw on reddit they don’t drop from campaign anymore,Spitfire2266,1
What about the weapons from Asher?,Trissin,1
I guess those would be gone too?,Trissin,1
I don’t think any red war quests have those anymore,Crizum,1
kinda sucks,Buttkikker,1
Nightfalls drop exotics like candy though so it balances,Crizum,1
especially seeing as new players need so many exotics to catch up,Buttkikker,1
I'm not sure I like that,Trissin,1
Exotics _should_ be rare,Trissin,1
And I think new players need at least some compensation for the campaign lol,Trissin,1
Compensation is they don’t have to play it lol,Crizum,1
"@Crizum Yeah even on lower difficulties as well, I've gotten one exotic each week from the level 2 ordeal",CrizMobius,1
"Ordeal is the endgame content that isn’t raids, it’s more for farming a good roll on armor exotics since collections come in lower",Crizum,1
and because of the different elemental affinities,Buttkikker,1
you need some way to farm armor,Buttkikker,1
but i dont believe weapons drop,Buttkikker,1
Yeah the only thing missing is like a quest where you can get a specific exotic,CrizMobius,1
I feel like the odds right now on exotic armor is a bit too low,CrizMobius,1
"There’s a good mix of quested/random drops, and once you hit cap I think primes have a pretty good chance of being an exotic",Crizum,1
Plus Xur has the knockout system on his engrams,Crizum,1
Yeah but  if you want for example acitum war  rig with a different elemental property then the chaces are pretty low,CrizMobius,1
See I don’t understand why they didn’t at least curate collections for exotics that interact with weapons lol,Crizum,1
What use is war rig with pulse affinity?,Crizum,1
its arc affinity if i remember,CrizMobius,1
which works with machineguns but not auto rifles,CrizMobius,1
Smooth Bungie,Crizum,1

Does anyone know if black garden kills (like offensive) count toward moon kills for the void class triumph,the_drake1997,1
they should,Buttkikker,1
"They do, so do kills on garden of salvation",Arixama,1
Fan damn tastic lol thank you,the_drake1997,1
just had a dude in another server try to say the ikelos smg was better than recluse.,thegoaliebear,1
um.,Oathbreaker,1
...,Buttkikker,1
uhhh...ya,thegoaliebear,1
I have concerns.,Oathbreaker,1
^ my reaction.,thegoaliebear,1
well it certainly looks better!,RonInDune,1
"and sounds a bit better too, but that's subjective",RonInDune,1
haha that's all it really has going for it.,thegoaliebear,1
The Warmind aesthetic was amazing,RonInDune,1
"but this is one of those guys who's always like ""it's all a matter of opinion"" and I'm like yeah sometimes but in this case there are guns that are just objectively better than others😂",thegoaliebear,1
"Armour, gun design, architecture, everything was very unique",RonInDune,1
Oh yeah I fully agree with you there lol,RonInDune,1
There is nothing better than Recluse atm,RonInDune,1
If it were a matter of opinion we wouldn’t have things considered god rolls right?,Crizum,1
exactly.,thegoaliebear,1
anyone gotten exit strategy yet?,Spitfire2266,1
yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
how was the grind?,Spitfire2266,1
working on it now,Spitfire2266,1
finished randys yesterday,Spitfire2266,1
it's not bad at all. a breeze compared to Randy's.,thegoaliebear,1
yea randys was awful,Spitfire2266,1
the smg multikills you'll probs have done in 2-3 matches. the points earned takes the longest but i got it done in a couple nights just dedicated to gambit.,thegoaliebear,1
regular gambit is probably better just since you have two rounds to send blockers and kill stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
whats the best for medals?,Spitfire2266,1
regular?,Spitfire2266,1
yeah either will work for those pretty consistent too with progress.,thegoaliebear,1
i got mine done in two nights of just gambit. goes much faster than the others aha.,thegoaliebear,1
randys is so damn good,Spitfire2266,1
like one of my fav guns in the game,Spitfire2266,1
@thegoaliebear wait isnt the ikelos smg a 750rpm?,Chance,1
so i guess there is SOME merit in that guys claim,Chance,1
but recluse is still recluse,Chance,1
cant beat it,Chance,1
@Destiny [PC] anyone wanna do scourge tonight,Chance,1
"Buttkikker and I are playing some gambit, he has divinity and I have taken spec on my weapons. I am running tether with 100 intellect and bad juju. I feel bad for our enemies.",Nahkriin,1

"because bad juju aint enough, 100 intellect",Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
"Don't know what the hell happened but in shattered throne i was suddenly revived and the message "">revived Nahkriin"" came up.",Nahkriin,1
Were you solo??,Trissin,1
"No, buttkikker was with me but he didnt know what happened either. I think it was a bug, Ive never seen anything like it though",Nahkriin,1
I think that happens when a darkness zone no longer becomes a darkness zone,Trissin,1
like a boss is defeated or something,Trissin,1
I know I've seen it before as well but I can't remember where atm,Trissin,1
ah,Nahkriin,1
"I've also seen it in PvP I think, for certain game modes",Trissin,1

what the heck there are people at Season Rank 600 already,RonInDune,1
😱,RonInDune,1
oh wow,Buttkikker,1
if you grind all the dailys and weeklys on all chars in a day its worth like 2mil xp i think,Buttkikker,1
so that would help,Buttkikker,1
either way really impressive,Buttkikker,1
holy crap,Trissin,1
looked them up on raid report and they've already flawlessed GoS,Buttkikker,1
TBH flawless garden is not nearly as difficult as you may think,Trissin,1
I know quite a few who have done it as well,Trissin,1
"Especially with the relay bug right now, they pretty much all agree the relay bug makes it a cakewalk",Trissin,1
ah,Buttkikker,1
good to know,Buttkikker,1
What's the relay bug? The enhanced realy defender one?,RonInDune,1
"If you want to get flawless garden, best do it before that gets patched",Trissin,1
"Yeah, that's the one",Trissin,1
where you swap armor and move around,Trissin,1
Do you still get stuff after season rank 100?,1minatur,1
Yeah you get Tess's engrms every 5 or so levels I think,RonInDune,1
"Also, Gothalion switched to Mixer",RonInDune,1
Wasn't he the biggest Destiny 2 streamer?,RonInDune,1
i never followed him much.,thegoaliebear,1
really only watch Broman or Datto for D2 stuff.,thegoaliebear,1
"Me neither, I didn't like how forced everything in his stream felt.  Broman just discussed the move so I knew about it. Wonder if they're moving as well",RonInDune,1
@RonInDune I din't get that impression at all. I like his content.,CrizMobius,1
I watch broman too btw,CrizMobius,1
broman isn't moving haha. that's all his stream rn is.,thegoaliebear,1
oof,RonInDune,1
lots of disruption everywhere,RonInDune,1
i mean... i don't think it's enough for mixer. if anything it makes more room on twitch for others to grow.,thegoaliebear,1
Competition is good,CrizMobius,1
Like Twitch basically had streaming monopoly for the last 7 years?,CrizMobius,1
"they still do. mixer is nowhere close. but big names moving over definitely help them, but they really only bring over so many viewers.",thegoaliebear,1
i think it's easy for big name streamers to move since they'll have their viewers no matter what. but for growing streamers twitch is still probably better.,thegoaliebear,1
Especially with the vacuum it makes by the big stars leaving,Infernosi,1
DIdn't Ninja lose a good portion of viewers after moving to Mixer as well?,Peronix,1
Yeah for sure,CrizMobius,1
yeah his streams get like 10-15k viewers now. which is still a ton but he easily got like 30k most of the time on average.,thegoaliebear,1
"Just looked up the relay defender bug, well who wants to give it a try >_>",Crizum,1
We are using bugs now?,CrizMobius,1
"For flawless? Sure, it’s how streamers are low manning it and how others are getting flawless. For normal or teaching runs? No.",Crizum,1
"@Crizum I was joking, How does the bug work? 😏",CrizMobius,1
Good luck!,Trissin,1
"Haha, looks like you just swap around relay defender and advanced relay defender mods before the start of the third encounter",Crizum,1
I dont see how that's a bug tho,CrizMobius,1
Anyone interested in doing some survival crucible?,Kronohs,1
Trying to unlock recluse,Kronohs,1
They shouldn’t be stacking,Crizum,1
@Kronohs If your goal is to get recluse then solo queue is the best options. It suxs playing alone but the matchmaking is way better.,CrizMobius,1
Oh ok. Yeah it sucks playing alone. On heroic iii but having a hard time getting wins now for some reason,Kronohs,1
The key to glory rank below fabled is consistency and making less mistakes,CrizMobius,1
That's literally true for every rank though.,Oathbreaker,1
"As your rank increases, consistency goes up and mistakes go down. Simple as that.",Oathbreaker,1
"Just before Fabled is kinda harsh, lots of people going super sweaty",RonInDune,1
For sure but it gets more important with mechanics on higher glory,CrizMobius,1
I'm well aware of mechanical importance,Oathbreaker,1
Idk I keep being told mechanical skill isn’t important just run a one eyed striker,Crizum,1
I mean if you miss all your shots then OEM won't help you 😔,CrizMobius,1
Also snipers can two shot body shot strikers now,RonInDune,1
so that's a small relief,RonInDune,1
arcstriders are still impossible to hit though,RonInDune,1
"Arcstrider most busted pvp class, just has more people playing it so it isn’t a problem",Crizum,1
just run from an Arcstaff,Oathbreaker,1
needs to be popped right on top of you for a guaranteed kill,Oathbreaker,1
otherwise you outrun it,Oathbreaker,1
true true,RonInDune,1
"don't get me wrong, it's got that armor on the pop so you have to get the kill before the animation starts or the animation ends, but otherwise it's not the most busted lol",Oathbreaker,1
"Dawnblade, bottom tree striker are both more busted right now, not by a lot but by enough",Oathbreaker,1
and they're being nerfed so,Buttkikker,1
"yeah, but is dawnblade neutral as good?",RonInDune,1
"You can kill dawnblade and striker, bottom tree arc has “you are harder to kill when dodging” and “increases maximum sprint speed, recharged your dodge” built in",Crizum,1
@Crizum isn dodge busted with arc battery?,CrizMobius,1
"In that you can tank literally anything? Yes, but I’m avoiding the seasonal artifact since that will go away",Crizum,1
yeah it basically give you a boost in everything,CrizMobius,1
also I need to try the magnetic grenade + opressive darkness combo,CrizMobius,1
didnt work for me,Buttkikker,1
Hunters just get all up in their feelings if they aren’t the best at everything in the game,Crizum,1
"“I don’t get to be the best pvp class, the best group add clear, the best single target dps? NERF THEM ALL”",Crizum,1
uh? no? maybe some people with horrible egos but idgaf if hunters are the best,Oathbreaker,1
@Buttkikker there is some rng involved I heard,CrizMobius,1
I guess it’s just tiring reading arguments of wormhusk vs OEM without people acknowledging the wildly different scenarios those things involved,Crizum,1
"one existed for two months with no counterplay, the other has existed for a year with the ""counterplay"" of don't shoot the guy aka don't play the game lol.",Oathbreaker,1
@Crizum I have no problem as a titan main that they nerf btstriker and oem but it's just that the rest of the titan subclasses are mediocre in pvp,CrizMobius,1
I mean didn’t you just say “run away from arcstrider” as a counter lol,Crizum,1
to the super?,Oathbreaker,1
not to wormhusk?,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
"Just burn the OEM ape down, it’s not instant health and shields for the most part",Crizum,1
"okay so you're saying because running from super is counterplay to arcstrider right now, wormhusk is more busted than oem....?",Oathbreaker,1
Or was more busted than oem ever was?,Oathbreaker,1
"Oh I know it's not instant health and shields but you have the choice of shooting the titan and loosing, instantly making him more tanky than anyone else, or having your blueberries doing that and now you effectively have to 1v1.5 someone",Oathbreaker,1
I’m not trying to say OEM isn’t busted but I’m lacking caffeine,Crizum,1
"Idk, it’s busted but they aren’t invincible by any means, and we can’t count on blueberries for much",Crizum,1
It's also free info so you can't peek a titan using it,Oathbreaker,1
wallhacks hp buff and a damage buff is way too much,Buttkikker,1
Just saying the meta wormhusk existed isn’t the one OEM exists in,Crizum,1
And it’s getting a nerf anyway,Crizum,1
"I'm aware they aren't invincible, but I don't like the comparison that OEM is not as bad as Wormhusk was, when the one has existed for a year with fairly minor changes and the other existed for two months at most",Oathbreaker,1
"They said they're looking into making some changes, whether that's a nerf or not we'll see",Oathbreaker,1
It’s a badly designed band-aid exotic to help a poorly optimized class that has only become an issue once they buffed arc subclasses,Crizum,1
What? OEM or Wormhusk?,Oathbreaker,1
"But it has only become a major source of consternation after arc week, ain’t nobody complaining about hammer of sol one eyes",Crizum,1
OEM,Crizum,1
people have been complaining about OEM since october of last year,Oathbreaker,1
But it has blown up majorly since arc week right?,Crizum,1
"no? It's blown up since January-ish where more and more Titans had it. It was sold for the first time back in late March or early April, which was before Arc week.",Oathbreaker,1
"Do Titans need some better neutral games in their other trees? Absolutely, but the issue of OEM has been present since it's introduction.",Oathbreaker,1
"My bad on that one I guess, I just assumed since the meme was “OEM striker lul” it was an arc week inspired issue",Crizum,1
I do feel like people will complain about literally anything titans and warlocks get though,Crizum,1
because the vocal minority is salty hunter mains,Buttkikker,1
People will just complain. Period.,Oathbreaker,1
Every class has salty x mains though.,Oathbreaker,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
Fair enough and I’ll admit I’m a salty Titan main,Crizum,1
LOL,Buttkikker,1
Arent we all.....,CrizMobius,1
only when im bad,Buttkikker,1
"OEM can go away and get nerfed, but I don’t want to hear complaints about like our “no skill one hit melees” etc",Crizum,1
Thundercoil. That's all I will say.,Oathbreaker,1
Okay but arc battery,Crizum,1
Like I said not complaining about seasonal artifacts unless they stay throughout the seasons,Crizum,1
"Yeah, which is a fair counterpoint, not disagreeing, both are dumb lol.",Oathbreaker,1
If they bring them both back yes lol,Crizum,1
"Also the shoulder charges are literally full commits so just shoot him before he gets to you? Oh, and position better. People who bitch about that just don't know where to go in PvP I feel.",Oathbreaker,1
Seeing that even with OEM only striker Titan hits top 5 for win percentage with like dawnblade being the only warlock subclass was interesting,Crizum,1
Could have been console only on that one though,Crizum,1
I would just hope if they adjust striker further and end up sending OEM to the dirt they don’t leave striker in the ground again,Crizum,1
"The striker changes are fine IMO. OEM just needs to remove tracking and it'd be better. as it stands, if you shoot an OEM Titan and you have to go into cover, you cannot peek again without them knowing exactly when you're gonna peek.",Oathbreaker,1
maybe instead give the better radar for a few seconds or somthing,Buttkikker,1
Make it twilight garrison,Crizum,1
I don't think it still needs 3 things rolled into one,Oathbreaker,1
i totaly agree but if they do intend on keeping that then some changes would be nice,Buttkikker,1
!lfg search,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1

good luck to those in it!,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
striker titan is whatever i can live with it. but i feel OEM is just a crutch for a lot of average players.,thegoaliebear,1
the arcstrider combo nowadays is just as annoying. don't think shit like that has any real place in pvp but oh well.,thegoaliebear,1
"OEM starts to get real scary though when good players are using it and activating it on weaker teammates so whenever you run into them, they've got the overshield.",Infernosi,1
"yeahhh...i just don't like it haha. that's also why pvp doesn't have any longevity tbh. exotics like that, if you're a new player and all you're running into are titan's with OEM...you're not gonna play pvp again after you get your quests done.",thegoaliebear,1
or until you get OEM yourself and maybe decide you wanna be part of the meta lol. but that's not very likely.,thegoaliebear,1

@Papa_Palpatine. sometimes if you send them a really nice email they will refund the difference if it’s within a few days!,Salrus,1
im so incredibly mad perfect besides spike and masterwork :(,Buttkikker,1
Is gambit the best way to farm kills for that?,Arixama,1
i just launch a solo nightfall with 3 nade launchers,Buttkikker,1
old school nightfall btw,Buttkikker,1
If Mayhem is up that’s probably the fastest,Crizum,1
How long did it take you to get 100 kills? Or do powerful enemy's cou t for more too?,Arixama,1
not long there's 20 enemies before you even go into the infinite forest in a garden world,Buttkikker,1
its like 10-15 min for the 100 kills,Buttkikker,1
if even,Buttkikker,1
fighting lion is definitely helpful if you have it,Chance,1
you can just queue into a strike or nightfall with just the fighting lion and get the kills in like 10 minutes,Chance,1
"See I'm thinking whisper with taken armaments might be good, but I don't know timing wise if it's worth it",Arixama,1
my best roll rn is hard launch spike field prep kill clip and reload masterwork,Buttkikker,1
whisper is in a pretty nice spot currently with the removal of auto reloads,Buttkikker,1
and now you can easily chose sniper reserves or ammo finder,Buttkikker,1
btw is anyone interested in a 980 nightmary hunt before reset tomorrow?,Buttkikker,1
I’m down,Crizum,1
Want those time trials for Harbinger haha,Crizum,1
you know what would be awesome,Chance,1
if you could accumulate perk rolls you obtain and store them in your collection so you can pull a roll out with perks you've gotten,Chance,1
wouldnt that just make so much sense,Chance,1
specific rolls or perks per gun?,Buttkikker,1
Like armor 2.0 for guns?,Crizum,1
if you could customize it would be insane,Buttkikker,1
They tried that in d1,Arixama,1
but rolls youve gotten sure,Buttkikker,1
rolls you've gotten imo,Chance,1
"but if you could pull out your ideal roll, assuming you've gotten all those rolls",Chance,1
that would be nice,Chance,1
but also a double edged sword,Chance,1
Oh yeah,Crizum,1
because eventually everyone would have the god roll,Chance,1
which is good and bad,Chance,1
it would just be nice if there was some kind of bad luck protection,Chance,1
removes the grinding (which is good and bad depending on who you ask),Buttkikker,1
"Something like “I’ve gotten ricochet rounds on this smg, I can pull it from collections with ricochet rounds”?",Crizum,1
love having a slight disadvantage because someone is luckier than me,Chance,1
@Crizum yes or like if you accidently dismantle a good roll and you want it back type of thing,Chance,1
but then it turns into paying for vault space,Buttkikker,1
"Or something like, you got outlaw on one roll and kill clip on another you could select an outlaw/kill clip roll? Dunno if they’d ever want that",Crizum,1
there would still be grinding to do but it would be much more feasible to get the ideal roll,Chance,1
yeah,Chance,1
but maybe you HAVE to dismantle those rolls to 'unlock' the perks,Chance,1
"If they really wanted to make it a thing, make it a lower chance on dismantle",Crizum,1
"Either that, or consumables that let you re-roll specific perk slots?",Crizum,1
They did something like that in D1. People stopped grinding and just rerolled for the best in slot gear for PvP and PvE. Made things really boring.,Oathbreaker,1
"Double edge sword, makes it easier for people that don’t hardcore grind for rolls to get what they want, but at the cost of the long-term retention. I think it’s what lead to D2 vanilla",Crizum,1
Menagerie was the best way to handle it. You could go for what you wanted and decide the masterwork while still having to fight some rng,Crizum,1
yeah i wish there where more options tho,Buttkikker,1
"We're definitely going to see more stuff like menagerie going forward. Since shadowkeep and were already deep in development when opulence came out, they had no idea how people were going to react to the chalice.",Arixama,1
and the nightmare essences are amazing,Buttkikker,1
theyre grindable but not too much and they have amazing weapons,Buttkikker,1
@Crizum a menagerie loot rotation would also make a lot of sense,Chance,1
rotates the guns out for something else,Chance,1
put like retold tale and other shotguns on there,Chance,1
and stuff like that,Chance,1
once a month or something?,Buttkikker,1
yeah that would be awesome,Chance,1
lol i can spell,Buttkikker,1
Maybe I'm just cruel but I don't want good drops to come easily,Trissin,1
God rolls and exotics should be really rare / difficult to obtain,Trissin,1
I think that rarity is what makes it more exciting when you actually get a god roll or an exotic,Trissin,1
Yeah but it’s also ass to need them to be competitive in PvP,Crizum,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
Hmmmmm,Trissin,1
which is why I never care about pvp lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Maybe I don't play enough PvP but I don't think there's anything you **need** to perform well,Trissin,1
and that's also why players just turn away from pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
"Maybe a good roll gives a slight edge, yeah",Trissin,1
But nothing that you can't even challenge without the right weapon perks,Trissin,1
oh you can definitely be successful with non meta or god roll weapons. if you're good then you're good.,thegoaliebear,1
^^,Trissin,1
That's my opinion,Trissin,1
"I think Redrix was one of their best PvP weapons, excellent in the right hands, merely quite good with scrubs",RonInDune,1
Yeah but exotics and the hypothetical is what I mean,Crizum,1
"And I also think it's not hard to get a good roll on something, it just won't be perfect",Trissin,1
ah,Trissin,1
Reclus etc. broke that balance,RonInDune,1
but with everyone running around with shotguns that hit from sniper range and OEM...new players to the game are so easily discouraged from playing the mode.,thegoaliebear,1
"If exotics were super duper rare it feels unfair to be killed by them, if they aren’t rare enough they can feel whatever",Crizum,1
"Yeah I tried to introduce a friend to the game, he ran around the crucible for a couple of hours and quite disliked it",RonInDune,1
yeah the thing is that pve will always be the core of the game.,thegoaliebear,1
"You make a good point. Exotics could be considered a problem in that light, yeah",Trissin,1
i see so many people ask for trading in this game but imo it would ruin such a huge part of the grind especially with getting god rolls or like 1K and anarchy,Spitfire2266,1
"As someone with apparently better than average rng it took me like 5 clears for 1k voices, how many did it take goal just for a title?",Crizum,1
39,thegoaliebear,1
"Now imagine it isn’t a title, it’s a meta crucible weapon",Crizum,1
1k took you 39 runs?,Spitfire2266,1
39 on a weekly lockout lol,Crizum,1
rip,Spitfire2266,1
I think I got my title on my 27th,Trissin,1
ya,thegoaliebear,1
1st try 🙂,Spitfire2266,1
i nearly quit the game bc of that rng bullshit.,thegoaliebear,1
Got 1k before the glittering key,Trissin,1
lol,Spitfire2266,1
i got my glittering key and had no idea what it was,Spitfire2266,1
they finally learned their lesson.,thegoaliebear,1
rng items have no place in titles.,thegoaliebear,1
i much rather prefer the exotic quests for raid exotics,Spitfire2266,1
100%,thegoaliebear,1
like outbreak prime and touch of malice,Spitfire2266,1
Fully agreed,RonInDune,1
I still don't have anarchy and I'm mad,RonInDune,1
touch of malice was such a good quest since you got all of the books of sorrow grimoire cards doing it and those are amazing,Spitfire2266,1
I remember the session where every Criz got anarchy,RonInDune,1
even tho it was long af,Spitfire2266,1
I’m legit only missing tarrabah,Crizum,1
"all the inclusion of rng in titles did was create a feeling of resentment for players. rather than seeing someone with Rivensbane and going ""wow that person has real skill and dedication to do all those raid challenges"" people instead think ""ok so they had better rng than i did whatever""",thegoaliebear,1
i actually like tarabah everyone shits on it but when i got it its pretty fun,Spitfire2266,1
To be fair they still pulled a petras run so I’ll give them that haha,Crizum,1
"and not to say you wouldn't consider Rivensbane a skillful title to earn, but it wouldn't be your first thought if all you needed for the title was 1kv.",thegoaliebear,1
i want to try a petras run never even tried it,Spitfire2266,1
True,Crizum,1
i did petras run 2 months before i got 1kv.,thegoaliebear,1
"the sad thing about that title was that ideally, petras run *should have* been the last thing you attempt for the title. but the rng killed that structure.",thegoaliebear,1
very trye,Spitfire2266,1
true*,Spitfire2266,1
"I guess to the original point. Thorn, Last Word, Ace of Spades are all quested and all competitively viable, but imagine if they were just 1% drops or something",Crizum,1
totally agree.,thegoaliebear,1
The salt that would flow when getting tapped by an OEM Ace user would be off the charts,Crizum,1
lo,Spitfire2266,1
lol*,Spitfire2266,1
i wonder how they are going to change oem,Spitfire2266,1
Maybe a chance to proc overshield?,RonInDune,1
"Probably remove wallhacks, or lower the duration",Crizum,1
Like a 1 in 3 chance or something,RonInDune,1
i think that also has to do with the type of players. more hardcore players like us can deal with it. but to more casual players it's extremely discouraging.,thegoaliebear,1
the wall hacks need to go,Spitfire2266,1
but i totally want the wall hacks to go.,thegoaliebear,1
Naw rng exotics feel bad for a whole different reason lol,Crizum,1
Preferably a 1 in 20000 chance for wallhacks on getting hit,RonInDune,1
still too high a chance,Spitfire2266,1
literal wall hacks just...totally take the skill away. you cannot peek them with a chance because they literally know where you are and how you're moving.,thegoaliebear,1
If they take away health and leave wallhacks it’s just foetracer at that point,Crizum,1
It just makes you play so passive you cant ever challenge,Spitfire2266,1
The hunter invis grants true sight too right? With the bug exotic,RonInDune,1
the overshield and regen is fine tbh i think that's an exotic perk that's...exotic lol.,thegoaliebear,1
the wall hacks just make it way too much and a huge crutch for subpar players. which makes it even worse when you have an actual good player using it.,thegoaliebear,1
And yeah Ron,Crizum,1
Khepri’s sting gives true sight on smoke bomb,Crizum,1
the hunter thing annoys me just as much as oem haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"And foetracer marks targets and buffs damage on low health targets, no kill required",Crizum,1
"So I don’t think OEM will copy those, health on kill when the target damages you feels like it would reward good gunplay without feeling oppressive",Crizum,1
Would still be deadly in the right hands but wouldn’t make the other person just stop playing,Crizum,1
"@Trissin I agree with them being hard to get to a certain point. Its completely RNG based, its not like is the Redrix quest for example that takes a while to get but you're guaranteed to get it",Chance,1
you could farm for a year for something and never get the roll you want,Chance,1
especially if the perks are flooded with other perks,Chance,1
"lets use love and death as an example: the first trait has 7 different option, the 2nd has 8 the 3rd has 6 and the 4th has 4",Chance,1
which is actually pretty nice that the 4th one only has 4,Chance,1
but if you want an ideal role that 1/7 x 1/8 x 1/6 x 1/4,Chance,1
thats pretty low dawg,Chance,1
"As someone who plays card games alot I would say what they need to do is to put everything OP in the artifact ( Like card games do set rotations), that way it will go away at the end of the season. If they keep nerfing stuff then it will eventually become bland and boring..",CrizMobius,1
atleast something like badluck protection would be nice,Chance,1
i see what u mean,Trissin,1
perfection is a little too rare,Trissin,1
"I guess that's what makes rng and the whole system an issue in itself, right",Trissin,1
if this were easy to solve we wouldn't really have this prblem,Trissin,1
i guess I just prefer that very few/none have a god roll rather than everybody have it,Trissin,1
if that makes sense,Trissin,1
thats .075%,Chance,1
@Trissin I rather lock it behind some super difficult content instead of making it super super rare,CrizMobius,1
"^^
that would be the ideal solution",Trissin,1
but we're not gonna have a whisper/outbreak mission for every pulse with outlaw rampage are we,Trissin,1
call me crazy but I really like the model outbreak and whisper set,Chance,1
those really difficult timed missions,Chance,1
i enjoy those a lot,Chance,1
it feels rewarding,Chance,1
not exhausting,Chance,1
@Chance Problem is that that content takes ages to make,CrizMobius,1
unfortunately,Chance,1
If they could they probably have a quest and mission for each exotic,CrizMobius,1
"I think currently the menagerie is the best model we have for regular, non/exotic gear and random rolls",Trissin,1
"By the way, the Golden Joystick game awards voting is gonna close soon, so if anyone wants, vote!",RonInDune,1
"ou, ty ron",Trissin,1
https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/goldenjoystickawards/,RonInDune,1
which is why they should totally reuse the menagerie and add some kind of loot pool rotation,Chance,1
@Trissin I think so too but the feedback from menagerie won't make it into the pipeline until mid spring,CrizMobius,1
Shadowkeep isn't my personal GOTY (or even close) but it's definitely the best live service game right now,RonInDune,1
"out of curiosity ron, what is your goty then",Trissin,1

i think you have really good taste in games and stuff,Trissin,1

it will probably be good tho,CrizMobius,1
Agreed,RonInDune,1
It fulfills a different need,Infernosi,1
as long as there are no more scout final blows,CrizMobius,1
lol,RonInDune,1
"Outer Worlds is pretty good, not GOTY but I really enjoyed it",Crizum,1
"Don't worry, it'll be 1k sidearm final blows",Infernosi,1
"^
can we just talk about sidearms for a sec",Trissin,1
and Death Stranding is gonna come out and be all sorts of gas huffing greatness,Crizum,1
why has everyone gotten like 300 god roll smuggler's word,Trissin,1
but we can't god roll on other weapons,Trissin,1
"I'm prepared for sidearm kills lol, I've been stockpiling godrolls for years",RonInDune,1
Can't we just have an expansion with melee weapons,CrizMobius,1
Because there aren't a lot of kinetic things in the world loot,Infernosi,1
"Season of the King, nothing but reskinned rat kings",Crizum,1
Instant GOTY,RonInDune,1
"smuggler's word is jsut a specific example, so many god roll sidearms",Trissin,1
"I want spears, clubs and stuff",CrizMobius,1
"^^^
that would be fun LOL",Trissin,1
Sword and shield,Infernosi,1
I want big cartoon boxing gloves for my titan,RonInDune,1
And those ninja star things for my hunter,RonInDune,1
I mean Warframe has a variety of cool melee weapons,CrizMobius,1

Import the Zweihander from Dark Souls,RonInDune,1
I need the gunblades from monster hunter,CrizMobius,1

we both do,rozak,1
i just used it in gambit,rozak,1
it's BAD,rozak,1
go use skyburner's oath right now,Trissin,1
....,Buttkikker,1
Sky burners rips in crucible,Crizum,1
?????,Trissin,1
used it for like the first fourth of my randys quest,Buttkikker,1
Or,Crizum,1
i can't contribute to this.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I got destroyed by skyburners last night,RonInDune,1
Imagine Skyburners but in the heavy slot,Crizum,1
i think...as far as *heavy* exotics go...,thegoaliebear,1
tell me one exotic that is bad and I'll tell you why xeno is still worse,Chance,1
at least skyburners can do precision damage LOL,rozak,1
skyburn also doesnt have damage fall off,Chance,1
skyburner's oath,Trissin,1
and its not a heavy,Chance,1
sturm,Buttkikker,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
you can still use a worthwhile heavy with skyburn :)),Chance,1
sweet business,Trissin,1
Trissin,Crizum,1
sweet buisness got buffed in shadowkeep tho,Buttkikker,1
i heard but i haven't seen it around,Trissin,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Trissin,1
the only reason sturm is unpopular is because the meta isnt double primary anymore like it used to be,Chance,1
Sweet Business shreds,Crizum,1
why would you use a kinetic exotic when Revoker exists👀👀,thegoaliebear,1
its still very fun to use,Chance,1
and they just buffed sweet business,Chance,1
aint bad,Chance,1
sturm is fucking amazing,rozak,1
also can do precision damage,Chance,1
same with sturm,Chance,1
but I don't see any of y'all rocking sturm or sweet business or skyburners or etc. 👀,Trissin,1
just sayin,Trissin,1
shut up,rozak,1
actually,Chance,1
i was talking about sturm just the other day,rozak,1
your wrong,Chance,1
in the pvp channel,rozak,1
Xenophage is a sniper rifle with extra steps except it cant crit,Chance,1
"So even with those all not being great, they all can at least do precision damage",Crizum,1
and it doesnt even have a anti champion modifier like ALL the other new exotics do,Chance,1
I think max ammo with reserve is 26?,Chance,1
so 2 clips,Chance,1
I used xenophage on the new dungeon boss for one damage round and using my full reserves I still did less than one izanagi shot,Crizum,1
I see absolutely no reason to use this gun,Chance,1
I dont even see how it can be fun to use,Chance,1
compared to something like sturm or sweet business,Chance,1
@Crizum,Chance,1
okay,Trissin,1
thats all i need to hear,Chance,1
i just finished the quest,Spitfire2266,1
sturm and a drang baroque smacks,rozak,1
thanks crizum,Chance,1
lol I understand what yall are saying,Trissin,1
ready for dissapointment,Spitfire2266,1
welcome to the club mr spitfire,Chance,1
I just think it's a bit early to label it as trash and never use it again,Trissin,1
how,Chance,1
how,rozak,1
how would it be too early,Chance,1
maybe if it got a buff tomorrow,Chance,1
maybe if they fix the precision damage,rozak,1
^,Chance,1
Lol,Trissin,1
If it just did precision damage,Chance,1
It might actually be useful,Chance,1
I just think there is probably more to the gun than we are looking at,Trissin,1
"It has to compete against Whisper and any other GL and that's where the issue really comes in, and it can't compete with others in its own weapon class",rozak,1
Not every exotic is supposed to be a DPS machine,Trissin,1
it explodes,Chance,1
in a very small radius,Chance,1
"Could be for ad clear, majors, i dunno",Trissin,1
i think leviathans breath has a larger radius,Chance,1
so why not use that,Chance,1
"no, I think I'd rather have 21% or hammerhead",rozak,1
it can also stop unstoppable champions,Chance,1
more efficient add clearing,rozak,1
literally anything it better for add clear,Chance,1
I don't think it'd be good for bungie to release every single exotic being better than the last,Trissin,1
I bet a blue sidearm is better for add clear,Chance,1
i cant believe it doesnt have a champion mod,Spitfire2266,1
yes but this one isn't even redundant,rozak,1
it just sucks,rozak,1
lol,Trissin,1
okay,Trissin,1
hasn't it been like that for a while though trissin?,Chance,1
new exotics always being better,Chance,1
where every exotic is better than the last?,Trissin,1
for the most part,Chance,1
"not in my opinion, no",Trissin,1
maybe not in all cases but it seems to be true,Chance,1
So with something like leviathans breath even though it matches precision and does less body damage than sleeper I can see the place in the sandbox Bungie intended for it. It’s unstoppable rounds make up for it not being insane and the knock back is interesting,Crizum,1
"sweet business, sturm, and skyburn are all year one weapons",Chance,1
which happen to be your examples of bad exotics,Chance,1
do i see a trend here,Chance,1
"Lol, okay okay",Trissin,1
We are all entitled to our own opinions here,Trissin,1
ok wish ender,Buttkikker,1
I don't have xenophage yet so I can't make as clear of a judgement quite yet,Trissin,1
there might end up being a use for it idk. but just from what I've heard it sounds incredibly underwhelming considering all the other heavy exotics we have.,thegoaliebear,1
"Erianas Vow is an interesting concept, and this is as well. A slow firing heavy machine gun could be really interesting, but with no mod and thus no place in nightfalls it comes down to do I use this, or do I get comparable heavy damage with a legendary and rock one of the interesting exotics from Shadowkeep",Crizum,1
opinion or not xenophage is objectively one of the worst exotics in the game,Chance,1
maybe even one of the worst weapons in the power slot,Chance,1
that might be a bit much tho,Chance,1
Lol,Trissin,1
"You can't really talk about this being a matter of opinion when the weapon can't survive in the suggested role, and can't compare/compete with weapons in its own weapon class that aren't even exotic",rozak,1
I think they intended it to be an invader killing weapon that isn’t heavy machine gun bad on AI enemies,Crizum,1
"honestly, i dont even care if its a bad gun",Arixama,1
its at least interesting and has good story tied to it,Arixama,1
I honestly thought this weapon was gunna take over gambit,Chance,1
"But that’s hard to balance for in crucible, two body shots to kill is nice as it matches all precision shots on hammerhead, but you only get 4 rounds?",Crizum,1
I haven't had a chance to acquire it yet,Trissin,1
but the fact that it cant even do precision damage,Chance,1
both very important parts of the exotic weapon type,Arixama,1
means its almost worthless,Chance,1
I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy or not that it doesnt one tap in pvp,Chance,1
"Precision damage lacking may or may not be intended, and they can always fix or catalyst fix it. As it stands it’s a boring retread of a weapon that just came out a week ago lol",Crizum,1
I feel like it would be a bug?,Chance,1
it just doesnt seem right,Chance,1
"I mean if you want my opinion, its a cool gun",Chance,1
I was excited to get it,Chance,1
its nice to shoot,Chance,1
but its bad,Chance,1
it dont do the big yellow number,Chance,1
not big yellow number bad,Chance,1
I love everything about it except that I can’t justify taking it over an exotic sniper,Crizum,1
exactly,Chance,1
"That's the crux of the argument, yes",rozak,1
or any other heavy for that matter,Chance,1
"I’ll have to test it further, some streamer may find some godly use for it",Crizum,1
taking it is basically unjustifiable,rozak,1
I can do its job better with a kinetic special weapon,Chance,1
It will probably be nuts in Mayhem,Crizum,1
doubtful,Chance,1
you only get 3 in mayhem i think,Chance,1
but i guess if you weapons of light up it one taps,Chance,1
but still you could use anything else and get the same or better result,Chance,1
if this gun is going to remain not going precision damage,Chance,1
then they should definitely up the RPM and reserves imo,Chance,1
atleast for pve,Chance,1
"Even if it could do precision damage I think Xenophage would be an indictment of an ongoing issue with D2's design, and it's obsolescence as soon as the new stuff comes out, they just blew their load in forsaken and now they don't know what to do",rozak,1
I think Bungie needs to take a page out of Ratchet and Clank's playbook,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
or gearbox,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"To be fair, I really like the design of Deathbringer. But the space is so crowded it doesn't feel as unique, and it's power is still very much overshadowed",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"yeah. i enjoy using deathbringer. stuff like vex offensive makes it fun to use stuff out of the box like that. but as far as practical, endgame usage things are still the usual.",thegoaliebear,1
Anybody doing the last step of Xenophage right now?,Infernosi,1
i like just did it rip,Chance,1
that dungeon is aids,Rye,1
"the first and mid part is ok, midpart with the tunnels is super cool",Rye,1
the end part is extremely stupid,Rye,1
what why is that,Trissin,1
"I like this dungeon, it feels really immersive and fairly interesting",Trissin,1
"The mechanics are not complex, but also can't be ignored",Trissin,1
I really didn't like how it was rinse and repeat for the final boss,Rye,1
you literally kill the same 3 mobs like 4 times to get to damage phase on the boss,Rye,1
I didn't play it all the way through yet i just went far enough for xenophage,Chance,1
the first encounter gave me blighttown vibes,Chance,1
from dark souls,Chance,1
anyone attempt the master nightfall yet or know of any strats for it? might just look it up but jw.,thegoaliebear,1
It should be pretty easy honestly. It's garden world so it's pretty much just kill all the enemies and go slowly so you don't die,Arixama,1
yeah that's what i figured. it's just for the completion so taking things slow is probs just the best.,thegoaliebear,1
"I’ll likely run izanagi recluse spike launcher (depending on setup, maybe machine gun), and well lock",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
Recluse w overload or whichever,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
that's fine. i'll be on tether. i have exit strategy w/ anti barrier and recluse with overload. i'll also probs use leviathan's breath for unstoppable stuff and get a build going for that.,thegoaliebear,1
Lev breath seems great,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
The inly thing is the knockback ill have to time my izanagi shots,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
"yeah, and considering it's just for completion we can really take our time with it. play things safe and whatnot.",thegoaliebear,1
Nightfall 950 anyone?,Kronohs,1
i would but i have class soon :(((,thegoaliebear,1
@Kronohs I can do 950,CrizMobius,1

:20 sec in the destiny vid, 1:03 on the other one",Rye,1
literally the exact same song,Rye,1
"@Rye it probably bought music, its quite common actually that trailers share music",CrizMobius,1
except that that song isn't from a trailer,Rye,1
its from the game,Rye,1
its a song that plays whenever you beat a level in saints row 3,Rye,1
the best one though was the GOT trailer using the music from the TRON ost,CrizMobius,1
kek,Rye,1
did they really?,Rye,1
yep,CrizMobius,1
@Rye It could be that the music in saints row 3 is actually bought as well,CrizMobius,1
maybe,Rye,1
wouldn't think that Deep Silver would do that,Rye,1
It's more common than you think,CrizMobius,1
It doesn’t phase me cause I’m old and I remember most of the Megaman soundtrack being what amounts to covers of rock songs,Crizum,1
But yeah lots of game music shares sections with other game songs,Crizum,1
"song is called ""Bit Rate"" by Johnny James",Rye,1
ez clap,Rye,1
Woah,RonInDune,1
congrats,RonInDune,1
Also there's a cat on top of the tree and it appears to be purring,RonInDune,1
the tree behind Eva I mean,RonInDune,1
has anyone attempted a solo dungeon clear yet,Spitfire2266,1
i want that solo flawless emblem bad,Spitfire2266,1
I have not attempted a solo,Rye,1
doing it with 3 people was still hard,Rye,1
i think i might attempt one tonight after my midterm,Spitfire2266,1
Give it a go!!!,Trissin,1
Why do I have like 8000 things due now,Oathbreaker,1
I want to play the new content,Oathbreaker,1
This one is more difficult than solo flawless shattered throne I think,Trissin,1
man all of my shit was due right around shadowkeeps launch and i did not manage my time well,Spitfire2266,1
so it'll be a good challenge,Trissin,1
i got trash marks on like 3 midterms but im bouncing back now lol,Spitfire2266,1
"but no, I gotta design a drill jig, make a video for a QA presentation, work on some statics assignment and don't even get me started on calculus (I mostly blame the program required for online work)",Oathbreaker,1
what are you taking?,Spitfire2266,1
do you guys use webwork,Trissin,1
fuck webwork,Spitfire2266,1
"No, MyMathLab",Oathbreaker,1
Which is horrible,Oathbreaker,1
Mechanical Engineering is what I'm taking.,Oathbreaker,1
typing in these massive answers into webwork makes me want to die,Spitfire2266,1
damn engineering,Spitfire2266,1
i dont think i could handle that heavy a work load,Spitfire2266,1
normally it's not that bad,Oathbreaker,1
Hmm,Trissin,1
"Every so often though all the profs get together and say ""okay now we just hit them with every assignment possible"" /s",Oathbreaker,1
lol im getting destroyed rn i had like 4 midterms in one week 2 on one day and these excel assignments that our prof marks so hard like its not even funny. The class average for our first assignment in my excel econ class was a 46%,Spitfire2266,1
ooooooooooof,Oathbreaker,1
yea i was expecting the class to be relatively easy but holy its probably one of the hardest classes ive taking in all my years so far,Spitfire2266,1
best of luck to all of you with your classes,Buttkikker,1
damn my webcam that says it was delivered today might have been swiped from my door...people suck.,thegoaliebear,1
but good thing Amazon will replace it for free😩,thegoaliebear,1
ooh no!!,RonInDune,1
That horrible,RonInDune,1
it's weird tho bc it says delivered at 2 and my roommate left at 215. so either someone was quick to swipe it or it went to the wrong apt.,thegoaliebear,1
bc I've had plenty of things delivered this year and no issues at all.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oof, imagine if that was something absolutely essential",RonInDune,1
yeah for real. like thankfully amazon is so good that they will replace it or just refund me the money so i can order it again.,thegoaliebear,1
but imagine if it really was stolen people are so sad man...,thegoaliebear,1
Utter pricks,RonInDune,1
but ik sometimes they mark it as delivered but the truck is still on its way. idk they're sending the driver back so curious to see what he has😂,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah that might've happened. In India almost all Amazon package are *paid* cash on delivery so little chance of getting swiped,RonInDune,1
I don't think Amazon US has that option?,RonInDune,1
"@thegoaliebear do you have a seperate mailbox? My package that came today said it was at the door, but was actually in the mailbox",Arixama,1
yeah I've checked my apt mailbox and the big boxes they put packages in sometimes.,thegoaliebear,1
like...i know I'll get the refund if it is missing so not worried about that...just sucks knowing people really are that sad to go around swiping packages or blatantly taking them in if it was delivered to the wrong place.,thegoaliebear,1
sounds like ontrac oramazon delivery service. those delivery guys suck. they'll mark it delivered and then actually deliver it hours later just to pad their delivery times and stuff. guy probably wanted to get lunch and was pressed for time,SpoOoOoky!!!,1
yeah I'm hoping that's what it is. they said they're sending the delivery guy back to the area so honestly it might just be that he never delivered it in the first place lol.,thegoaliebear,1
but time will tell.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear wow that suxs,CrizMobius,1
Can't wait for robotic/drone delivery,RonInDune,1
imagine you're someone tryna swipe the package and the drone just laser beams you.,thegoaliebear,1
that would be so great.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm willing to risk the Terminator future if it means I always get my fancy umbrella on time,RonInDune,1
hell ya,thegoaliebear,1
Did anyone see the Death Stranding release trailer? It was so incredibly confusing,RonInDune,1
Bungie should honestly consult Kojima to write their stories,RonInDune,1
It'd be glorious,RonInDune,1
like...i won't be getting the game regardless. but idk how i feel about it lol. visually tho...looks stunning.,thegoaliebear,1
It looks like what I imagined games should like when I was a kid,RonInDune,1
guys in the new crucible game mode wish ender one taps and gives wall hacks infinitely with the hunter gauntlets oathkeeper,Buttkikker,1

I love it,RonInDune,1

so just a guy padding his delivery time.,thegoaliebear,1
yay!!,RonInDune,1
gawt dang stat padders,SpoOoOoky!!!,1
which is weird because I've never actually had that happen. whenever it says delivered i always come back to the package there.,thegoaliebear,1
but...just glad it wasn't stolen haha.,thegoaliebear,1
its the non union guys,SpoOoOoky!!!,1
Fed ex and UPS dont fuck with that shit,SpoOoOoky!!!,1
its the Ontrac and Amazon Delivery guys that are just private contractors,SpoOoOoky!!!,1

yup.,thegoaliebear,1
I absolutely LOVE this new crucible gamemode,Buttkikker,1
im enjoying it so much,Buttkikker,1
the ability to use less used weapons super effectively allows for all sorts of new strats,Buttkikker,1
suros regine on the slow fire mode?,Buttkikker,1
124 damage per headshot!,Buttkikker,1
its amazing,Buttkikker,1
my blast furnace was one bursting,Chance,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
only needed 3 of the bullets to hit head,Chance,1
its so fun,Buttkikker,1
was nice to finish off the precision kill portion of the redrix quest,Chance,1
unfortunately it seems bungo counted for grenade launchers,Chance,1
they dont feel like they are doing much more damage tbh,Chance,1
maybe im  just bad,Chance,1
fighting lion one shots,Buttkikker,1
i took my fighting lion in there but was getting nailing them down to 10 hp 90% of the time,Chance,1
the other 10% was one shots,Chance,1
its ultra inconsistent,Chance,1
hmm,Buttkikker,1
not entirely sure why,Chance,1
maybe im just bad,Chance,1
one guy i fought was really consistant,Buttkikker,1
I ran in to invis hunters with jade rabbits on widows court,Crizum,1
probably becuase of its weird fireing thing,Buttkikker,1
The game mode is garbage,Crizum,1
:(,Buttkikker,1
it aint a bad gamemode until you start running into trace rifles and wraith hunters with 150 rpm scouts holding crouch all game,Chance,1
"It's not bad, could be really good, but the one-tap Jade Rabbits are annoying",Peronix,1
the favorite part in all honesty is the no radar,Chance,1
there is no long drawn out OEM fights,Buttkikker,1
fast paced gameplay,Buttkikker,1
See I liked halo and I don’t like cod,Crizum,1
^^^ yeah it seems most exotics are basically useless,Chance,1
which is also really nice,Chance,1
So fast TTK is ass,Crizum,1
im more of a halo person as well,Chance,1
but there are some nice things about it compared to regular Destiny pvp,Chance,1
some,Chance,1
my favorite part honestly is just coming up with cool unique builds,Buttkikker,1
because its more than hand cannons snipers and shottys,Buttkikker,1
not to mention recluse mountaintop everywhere,Buttkikker,1
oh and i did find out that 150 rpm scouts are the only archetype of scouts that will one tap headshot,Chance,1
it was hilarious running into ppl using recluse in that gamemode,Chance,1
i dont tihnk i ever died to one,Chance,1
and once people finish randys the scouts should fade out,Buttkikker,1
hopefully,Chance,1
really tired of them dang scoutsb0ss,Chance,1
wonder how far slug shotties can on tap in that mode,Chance,1
another thing to discover i suppose,Buttkikker,1
I did get sniped by the Chaperone a couple of times but that might not be unique to this mode,RonInDune,1
have you ever one bodied with an auto?,Buttkikker,1
no?,Buttkikker,1
well now you can with Cerberus catalyst,Buttkikker,1
the catalyst almost turns it into a shotgun,RonInDune,1
what is this new crucible mode yall talking about.,thegoaliebear,1
"won't spoil, go in and look!",RonInDune,1
its called momentum control,Buttkikker,1
but try it out for yourself if you have a chance its the best,Buttkikker,1
that name explains nothing btw,RonInDune,1
yeah lol,Buttkikker,1
i promised myself i wouldn't touch pvp afyer getting randys so y'all can share haha.,thegoaliebear,1
but its fuuuuuuuuuuuuun,Buttkikker,1
unlike actual crucible,Buttkikker,1
"it is actually fun, i was pleasantly surprised",RonInDune,1
the cerberus cata does turn it into a shotgun,Chance,1
not almost,Chance,1
it does,Chance,1
a 33 round high rate of fire shotgun,Buttkikker,1
maybe i should be that wraith hunter so i can get my randy's,Chance,1
"I had this weird dream the other day where I was on the last encounter of the vault of grass raid, and there was some easter egg in the fight that we triggered.

Afterwards I was awarded this cool trace rifle that tethered to nearby enemies",Chance,1
wouldnt that be a cool idea,Chance,1

"@Buttkikker it’s a steam thing, use Unicode letters I think",Crizum,1
that was a lot of work for some legendary shards and enhancement cores,Arixama,1
mood.,thegoaliebear,1
OKAY WHAT THE ACTUALY FUCK,Chance,1
I guess bungo doesnt want me to play warlock,Chance,1
I have a full set up dreambane equiped but i cant start the last campaign mission,Chance,1
"I've unequipped re-equipped the armor, killed myself, reloaded the area, went back into orbit and reloaded the area again, and even restarted my game",Chance,1
and I still cant start the mission,Chance,1
love how this bug is still in the game since release and its somehow worse?,Chance,1
no wait ignore all that im retarded,Chance,1
forgot you need to talk to eris first after getting a full set,Chance,1
for some dumbass reason,Chance,1
makes 0 sense,Chance,1
thanks bungo i now feel like an idiot,Chance,1
Antone know what happens if you play destiny 2 on pc without the shadowkeep dlcs when you have it on ps4?,Nexeran,1
you can't access shadowkeep activities if you don't have it on pc.,thegoaliebear,1
@Peronix @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) i'm in voice chat whenever you guys wanna join no rush at all tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"Well I mean if I have shadowkeep gear, will it still let me use it?",Nexeran,1
oh yeah you can use all your gear still.,thegoaliebear,1
"you just wont be able to get new shadowkeep drops, or do shadowkeep activities",Arixama,1
no idea,Spitfire2266,1
Finally done exit strategy,Spitfire2266,1

aw man,Pentan,1
well at least it was with someone special,Pentan,1
c ya later,Pentan,1
i remember the forest being easier,Pentan,1
you used to get extra time per wave cleared,Buttkikker,1
So I'm currently soloing the new dungeon as practice for solo flawless,Trissin,1
In the tunnels with the ogres,Trissin,1
"even after unlock all the gates and you get ""objective complete""",Trissin,1
the ogres will _continue_ to attack and kill you,Trissin,1
"and if you die here, it just sets you back to the last encounter again?",Trissin,1
:((,Trissin,1
oh that sucks,Buttkikker,1
i wonder if you have to go right into the next area and start the next encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
It seems like it,Trissin,1
the tunnels are so hard,Trissin,1
you get stuck in a room with ogres on both sides,Trissin,1
people are saying this was easier than solo flawless ST???,Trissin,1
no way imo,Trissin,1
holy edgewise is so short to get,Spitfire2266,1
"@Destiny [PC] for those that don’t read twab, Bungie Bounty this Saturday at 10am pacific, play momentum control and if you get a match with King Gothalion and win you get the emblem",Crizum,1
emblem?,Chance,1
oh i see,Chance,1
"folks if you're grinding for Randy's, put on a fast charging fusion and head into momentum control",RonInDune,1
I went from 8% to 52% medals in 5 or so matches,RonInDune,1
@Trissin i think the tunnels and the encounter after it are the toughest for a solo flawless. but the other encounters seem easy enough.,thegoaliebear,1
i-,thegoaliebear,1
I'm actually so sad the bounty is this week,Oathbreaker,1
I'm at work when the bounty starts and won't be done until after it ends,Oathbreaker,1
yeah i have a game today :/,thegoaliebear,1
Good luck!,Oathbreaker,1
hah thanks. likely not playing at all this weekend tho my wisdom teeth decided to start coming in yesterday so it's pretty painful 😂,thegoaliebear,1
yeah that's always painful as hell,Oathbreaker,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
i was about to make one for this and then realized this was at the exact time i'd be available lol.,thegoaliebear,1
if a third wants to join that would be great.,thegoaliebear,1
Tunnels were hard at first but honestly it was because I didn't know the terrain and didn't understand the ogre pathing/aggression,Trissin,1
I stopped trying at totem because I realized I was underlevelled and the red-bar adds were shredding me in my well lol,Trissin,1
im gonna be on vacation for a week so ill be completely unavailable,Rye,1
feelsbadman,Rye,1
well...i need all my wisdom teeth out so I'll be out of commission for the next week or so haha.,thegoaliebear,1
nice,Rye,1
I had all of mine removed at once,Rye,1
be careful not to smile too much or laugh too much afterwards for like 3-4 weeks,Rye,1
you'll pull your stiching out like I did,Rye,1
that is not fun,Rye,1
at all,Rye,1
I'm just happy i don't have to fuck with hockey for a bit now😂,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone want to raid today? I have the rest of the day off and want to give it a go,Kronohs,1
Did part of my first raid (leviathan) with another LFG last week and it was a lot of fun,Kronohs,1
i won't be back from my game until at least 10:45 est tonight. so likely is a no go for me.,thegoaliebear,1
@Kronohs i would set up an lfg post here if people are interested or if they can make it they'll join it.,thegoaliebear,1

but if you guys want more experienced players im fine to give my spot,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
looking for a chill run so you're definitely welcome,Kronohs,1
it's Leviathan. yall will be fine haha.,thegoaliebear,1
unexperienced players welcome I mainly want to help @rozak get keys and stuff for year 1 exotics,Chance,1
the more people im helping the better,Chance,1
and yeah its really easy,Chance,1
i had a team of 3 experience and 3 not and we basically one shot every encounter,Chance,1
actually it seems my wife is having some health problems; it's possible I'll end up needing to leave soon so I think it'll be best if I sit this out,Kronohs,1
bummer,Kronohs,1
have fun y'all,Kronohs,1
"gonna restart my pc, brb",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

does anyone want to run a 980 nightfall?,Spitfire2266,1
just want to finish my undying badge,Spitfire2266,1
undying requires 980 nightfall?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
The ship you get from the 980 triumph is needed for the season badge,Crizum,1
yea,Spitfire2266,1
@Spitfire2266 this weeks nf is brutal.I'm waiting until next week to see which one it is.,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear same here, I L&D’d and nova’d myself into a fine mist in that final encounter @920; those materializing walls aren’t having any of my shit so I stayed at the shallow end of the pool this week.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Oh god @Trissin I see what you mean by the ogres killing you in the pit even after completing the encounter,RonInDune,1
I'm so mad,RonInDune,1
"Lol yeah, they just keep going",Trissin,1
I didn't finish my solo run because I realized it would probably be better to be above 950 lol,Trissin,1
"I couldn't even get the final lore piece, very sad now",RonInDune,1
Really not a fan of the dungeon deciding to kill me randomly when going to the pit encounter,Crizum,1
That happen to anyone else? Move beyond the loading zone and it just murders you?,Crizum,1
Yeah it happened to me mulitple times while going up elevators in the first encounter,RonInDune,1
It's a framerate issue. A lot of people say limiting your frames to 30 during that section fixes the problem,Peronix,1
Lol the hardest part of a flawless run is Bungie being Bungie,Crizum,1
so i just cleared the 10th branch in haunted forest but it didn't count as 9 cleared in a run for the pinnacle gear,Buttkikker,1
whaaat,RonInDune,1
the only thing i can think of is that we ended by dying rather than killing the 11th boss,Buttkikker,1
unfortunately something has come up and I won't be online tonight. sorry about the dungeon run,LW Mugetsu,1
It's all good!,Peronix,1
i might give this master nighfall a go but yea i dont think garden world is a good one to do it on,Spitfire2266,1
"The 950 version is still incredibly difficult, and I saw the way goal and peronix and the others got slapped around in the 980",RonInDune,1
I'll wait till it's the EDZ one,RonInDune,1
I was watching EK do it on his stream. it's very brutal. even his team struggled with it for a while and only got one clear in all the time I was watching.,thegoaliebear,1
if it becomes that one during the season,Arixama,1
there will definitely be one that's better. garden world is so awful because of how open the whole thing is.,thegoaliebear,1
"thanks again @RonInDune and @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 , hope yall had a good time",Trissin,1
"inverted spire was a really good one for it, because theres a lot of spots where you can just have someone kinda hang back and keep the encounter going if your teammates die",Arixama,1
there's a spot in garden world you can do that as well.,thegoaliebear,1
let's do a scourge run soon trissin! I want anarchy!,RonInDune,1
i doubt I'll be back at school next week to try. but I'm not worried about it. it's honestly kind of ridiculous how hard the 980 is.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Trissin thank you, it was pretty fun",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
and partly has to do with how shit they made the PL grind lol. the +2 pinnacle drops should help climb closer to being a more adequate PL for it.,thegoaliebear,1
this vanguard quest first watch is making me mental having to get all the ability kills in nightfalls,Spitfire2266,1
its so boring lol,Spitfire2266,1
ok it's kinda hard to solo the <secret weapon> final boss,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I'd definitely recommend grabbing a second from somewhere",Infernosi,1
Do we have enough people to try for some Scourge runs tonight?,RonInDune,1
guaranteed Anarchy drops,RonInDune,1
?????,Buttkikker,1
I would love to join but unfortunately im busy,Trissin,1
All you need for Anarchy is to change your steam name to start with Criz,RonInDune,1
"Ah well Trissin, next time!",RonInDune,1
I'm down for some Scourge runs,Peronix,1
well im down,Buttkikker,1
uhhh what was the command again,RonInDune,1
!lfg create,RonInDune,1
"^^
Good luck you guys, hope you get anarchy + fallen armaments!",Trissin,1
GIVE ANARCHY PLS,Oathbreaker,1
change name to criz*,RonInDune,1
it's guaranteed,RonInDune,1
100% success rate,RonInDune,1
Really buttkikker doesn’t need to because it’s either crizkikker or buttcrizzer and either are bad,Crizum,1
lel,Buttkikker,1
go clear the boss more @Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
I intend to,Oathbreaker,1
raid is about to start soon yeah? If so I need just a few minutes guys,Oathbreaker,1
no worries,RonInDune,1
i'll finish up some bounties meanwhile,RonInDune,1
logging in now.,Oathbreaker,1
Can we get a +1 for Scourge final boss?,RonInDune,1
We'll be doing two boss runs for Anarchy,RonInDune,1
i hate titans,Pentan,1
we hate u too 😘,Trissin,1
<3,Pentan,1
It's easy to deal with titans if you know their secret rules,RonInDune,1
Guys it’s literally one exotic and it’s getting nerfed,Crizum,1
"as long as they don't nerf the disco helmet, I'm still good with titans",RonInDune,1
Titans will be back in the dumpster soon and the hunters can be pleased being unchallenged,Crizum,1
Really titans and warlocks should band together,Crizum,1
I honestly hated the spectral blades meta more than one eyed mask,RonInDune,1
I honestly wish sentinel shield had the wacky hit detection spectral blades has,Crizum,1
"Btw that “punch stuff until dead” flowchart should be updated cause it isn’t a Titan thing anymore, that’s a liars handshake flowchart",Crizum,1
Titans have other options too.,Oathbreaker,1
"Fun loadout with Duke, Ashen Wake, Fusion Grenades, and Eriana's is good if you can aim. Eriana's 1-taps to the head with First Glance and bottom tree Sunbreaker with the Sun Warrior perk active.",Oathbreaker,1
"I’ll be fine with Monte Carlo and top tree sunbreaker or bottom tree sentinel with suppression grenades. I just don’t like the “fuck titans they’re broken” when it’s really just OEM. It’s warlocks turn anyway, let’s give them a buff or an exotic to reign over everyone for 6 or so months lol",Crizum,1
ah the nova warp days were fun,RonInDune,1
Nova Warp/Contraverse Holds,Crizum,1
"Nova warp is in a good spot now, not as OP as the first days of Forsaken and not as badly nerfed as they were right after",RonInDune,1
"Speaking of warlocks, how is getaway artist in momentum control?",Crizum,1
"It's inconsistent, by the time they fire you're already dead",RonInDune,1
Just corner camp with your arc buddy,Crizum,1
Boo,Crizum,1
contraverse hold and nova warp is how i got fabled last season lol,Spitfire2266,1
!lfg create,Crizum,1
@Destiny [PC] put up a crown run for later tonight if anyone is interested,Crizum,1
Oh no,Crizum,1
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JTnuuVYMyi0,Crizum,1
Oh I saw Gladd doing this last night,RonInDune,1
What now,Trissin,1
Basically negates the hardest encounter,Crizum,1
Well that kind of ruins things,Trissin,1
I wonder when they'll patch it out,Trissin,1
hopefully soon,Spitfire2266,1
^^,Trissin,1
Hey anyone want to intern at Bungie?,RonInDune,1
http://careers.bungie.com/en-us/careers/internship/1941946/ui-visual-design-intern,RonInDune,1
got taken armaments,Buttkikker,1
:o,Trissin,1
Bungie is in Seattle yeah?,Trissin,1
just been doing the free chest every week on all chars,Buttkikker,1
"That's real damn close to Vancouver, maybe I'll apply",Trissin,1
that would be cool!,Buttkikker,1
Definitely go for it!,RonInDune,1
Trissin you’re in Washington?,Crizum,1
"Though this position is in Bellevue, WA",RonInDune,1
You live like 30 minutes away if so haha,Crizum,1
Oh mbmb,Trissin,1
I thought Bungie was in Seattle for some reason,Trissin,1
I'm actually in Canada haha,Trissin,1
Vancouver,Trissin,1
Bellevue is like right next to Seattle though,RonInDune,1
"Ahh, I dunno why I thought Vancouver Canada was further",Crizum,1
Also why is Washington the state on the other side of the Universe from Washington the city,RonInDune,1
That's illegal,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
id love to apply to bungo but visual design isn't my thing,Trissin,1
More dets about the job offer:,RonInDune,1
and I've no experience in it,Trissin,1
it wouldn't be a good fit for either of us,Trissin,1
Ah tough luck then,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune i believe Washington the city came first,Arixama,1
Could you Imagine if John Hancock had been the first president though? We'd have Hancock D.C. And Hancock the state,Arixama,1
that is very correct lol.,thegoaliebear,1
2 more for crown tonight at 9 EST?,Sabre,1
!lfg search,Crizum,1
Should be able to find enough,Crizum,1
!lfg search,Donpablo,1
you guys still looking for crown?,Buttkikker,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
We’re in discord @RonInDune and @Sabre,Crizum,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^ for upcoming Sunday since pinnacle drops will be +2 now.,thegoaliebear,1
i also may change my mind to a master nightfall depending what the strike ends up being tomorrow.,thegoaliebear,1
"I still need divinity and haven't done a run in a bit, so down",obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
My bird,Buttkikker,1
BIRD,Chance,1
UP,Chance,1
Majestic...,Thawxtem,1
this week's nightfall is Strange Terrain. how bad do we think it'll be on Master?,thegoaliebear,1
Nokris? Probably not nice. There isn’t a whole lot of space to hide around in and without the Izanagi/Divinity wombo combo idk,Crizum,1
its nokris not xol i thought for strange terrain,Spitfire2266,1
Ah yeah that’s who I was thinking of but names,Crizum,1
if its nokris itll be rough you cant insta kill the boss,Spitfire2266,1
the ogre in the middle is pretty squishy and its a shortish strike so i dont think it will be impossible,Spitfire2266,1
Smart tether usage and well/bubble for sure,Crizum,1
i wanna play destiny rn but i need to finish my calculus assignment which i have 0 motivation to do,Spitfire2266,1
i might give the master NF a go. maybe monday.,thegoaliebear,1
I play w randoms so 920 it's hard enough lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah definitely depends on the strike. pyramidion and inverted spire weren't bad at all. but strange terrain can get pretty brutal.,thegoaliebear,1
i wish i had had the time to do the master nf when it was pyramidion.,thegoaliebear,1
Probably will be easier when you can hit at least 970 with pinnacle rewards and the artifact boost,Crizum,1
yeah. mainly why i wanted to do the raid on sunday instead of try for the master completion. those +2 drops will help a lot.,thegoaliebear,1
Looks like the first raid challenge has been solved ||only the team without the harpy boss kills their cyclops||,Crizum,1
i totally forgot those were a thing now.,thegoaliebear,1
"Misunderstood for a minute, edited clarification",Crizum,1
seems tough,Buttkikker,1
"Well, you could just use a Titan? Bubble them off",Crizum,1
"Not sustainable, but I think it isn’t terribly hard at current light levels",Crizum,1
"The reward for doing it is pinnacle too, so it’s worth attempting",Crizum,1
yeah definitely worth the effort,Buttkikker,1
i mean...i don't mind trying it on Sunday. but if we don't get it during the encounter i don't want to get caught up on it. mainly just want the clear.,thegoaliebear,1
Anyone doing Iron Banner?,Crizum,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
Team up?,Crizum,1
sure thing,Buttkikker,1
"After doing the first part of Banshee’s quest for the bow, I got terrible flashbacks from Zero Hour",Thawxtem,1
oh hey @Thawxtem haven't seen you on for a while! Welcome back!,RonInDune,1
"Oh, do you need solo flawless pit for harbinger?",Trissin,1
Interesting,Trissin,1
No,Crizum,1
"You just need to solo, and do a run where you don’t die",Crizum,1
ohh,Trissin,1
"Ah people have figured out the first Raid challenge already, if you do it you get an extra pinnacle chest drop at the end of that encounter",RonInDune,1
yeah we were saying we might try it on sundays run. but not a huge deal if we don't get it and i don't really want to get caught up on trying it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"It's honestly fairly easy, just run around to try and not get sniped",RonInDune,1
Love hackers in crucible,Crizum,1
The ones that go from lowest on their team to a 3.57 and two team pulls from 40 down to almost mercy ruling you in about two minutes,Crizum,1
yeah just like the guys obsolete peronix and i ran into in comp one night haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"So for the pit run with no deaths, you could just grab a final boss checkpoint on a different character, and keep reseting the checkpoint if you die?",Arixama,1
woah does that work?,RonInDune,1
"There are three triumphs, one for solo, one for no deaths, and one for solo no deaths. Idk about using a boss checkpoint but I assume if you can’t solo flawless the easiest would be grabbing two people who don’t mind dying and letting them do the heavy lifting haha",Crizum,1
wait @Arixama are you for real,Trissin,1
No way that works,Trissin,1
Because solo flawless ST is pretty strict,Trissin,1
"if anyone joins at any time, or if you leave at any time, you don't get the triumph",Trissin,1
I can't imagine they'd change it for the new dungeon,Trissin,1
But if it's just a completion with you not dying?,Arixama,1
for just flawless? I don't think it would work either,Trissin,1
But I don't know,Trissin,1
Did you see it somewhere on reddit?,Trissin,1
"No, just a thought I had",Arixama,1
Ah,Trissin,1
I can't imagine bungie haven't also thought of this though,Trissin,1
I mean you say that,Arixama,1
But also,Arixama,1
Bungie does have a history of not thinking of obvious things sometimes,Arixama,1
only way to find out is to try lol.,thegoaliebear,1
We need a sacrificial lamb,RonInDune,1
*baaaaa*,Peronix,1
Does anyone want to give a go at the master nightfall me and @HShmoob are going to run it,Spitfire2266,1
wish i could.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Arixama you mean like how they seem to do the ""all one element subclass"" runs? Where you don't have to get them all done in one raid, just have to have completed the different encounters at some point?",Crizum,1
"another example would I guess be nobody getting the curse debuff in crown, my triumph popped during the jumping crystal encounter because it was the last one I completed with nobody getting the debuff",Crizum,1
If it were that way it'd have the tick boxes for each encounter. I'm just curious if it's specifically looking for the boss encounter being completed with no deaths,Arixama,1
should be the whole dungeon,Trissin,1
just finished master nightfall,Spitfire2266,1
not bad at all,Spitfire2266,1
boss was way easier than i expected,Spitfire2266,1
finally done,Spitfire2266,1
Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
wow,RonInDune,1
what classes were you guys running.,thegoaliebear,1
if it's not bad I'd like to get it done when I'm back at school.,thegoaliebear,1
The more important question I think is what light levels you were at,Arixama,1
the screenshot they sent was 963.,thegoaliebear,1
honestly the only section i could see being super hard is the ogre. the boss is probably decently challenging but not too bad since you can get a lot of burst damage on him. prior areas there's lots of places to go back and hide or leave someone so the encounter keeps going.,thegoaliebear,1
We had me on well my friend on tether and a random with bubble,Spitfire2266,1
2 izanagi 1 divinity,Spitfire2266,1
Wendigo was good for dropping a arc shields and I ran edgewise for the solar wizard shields,Spitfire2266,1
It wasn’t bad at all,Spitfire2266,1
Took us just under 40 mins,Spitfire2266,1
rephrase that without izanagis 😜,thegoaliebear,1
and say Revoker instead.,thegoaliebear,1
Maybe whisper instead>,RonInDune,1
high key yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
Darci*,Arixama,1
or that.,thegoaliebear,1
either is fine. i just wanna get it done lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"Leviathan's breath, actually 😂",Arixama,1
"Whisper still does more damage if you can get consistent crits, which might be hard on Nokris",RonInDune,1
yeah i think darci is a better substitute for bosses that flinch around a lot.,thegoaliebear,1
I wish Malfeasance did bonus damage on hive as well,RonInDune,1
well...maybe i will try to get a run on sunday or monday for it. would be nice to head into undying mind week with that done.,thegoaliebear,1
True I might try to get one done as well,RonInDune,1
How's the tooth ache progressing BTW,RonInDune,1
it's not that bad now. but i imagine tomorrow it will be pretty achy aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"oof, my condolences",RonInDune,1
i just hate that this week i had to miss out on time i could play D2 since i don't have that much school work to do.,thegoaliebear,1
but oh well. maybe sunday I'll get back early enough to get some of that stuff done.,thegoaliebear,1
"ah well what can you do, gotta yeet the teeth someday",RonInDune,1
Now *that’s* a quote,Peronix,1
i need to get hive armaments for if i try solo dungeon,Spitfire2266,1
"We tried for Hive armaments yesterday, got my second Tarrabah but still no armaments",RonInDune,1

"so this is looking like the card i'll get for my upgrade. i've heard good things about Zotac's cards but just thought i'd run in by in case anyone thinks something else would be better. i don't really want RGB or anything on the card and this one looks pretty sleek and got good reviews.

"especially considering i'm at 1080p/144Hz, i don't think i'll have any issues running games at max with this thing lol.",thegoaliebear,1
Personally not a fan of Zotac but I don't hear disastrous things about them. Only thing is it may be a louder card or have poor temps but a 2070S is a solid card for sure,Oathbreaker,1
"yeah fan noise isn't too much of an issue for me since my PC isn't like, right next to me aha.",thegoaliebear,1
i was also looking at the Gigabyte 3-fan card which is also 499.99. wasn't too sure how it compared but that one seemed like it got hotter than this one just based off review searching.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, from what I know, Zotac > Gigabyte for GPUs but I tend to go with Asus or EVGA so I have very limited experience with the other manufacturers.",Oathbreaker,1
sweet. yeah since i'm going to Microcenter likely this weekend i was gonna check out the EVGA cards too. sometimes they have nice in-store only sales. all depends aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"For sure. Jealous of Microcenters, we don't have that in Canada. I've heard nothing but good things",Oathbreaker,1
haha it is a great place. their cpu/mobo combo prices are unreal. really can't be beat.,thegoaliebear,1
"I have the EVGA XC 2070 pretty sure, I'd have to find it again online but it's a solid card, hits 1080p 144hz no issues. Other thing is it's a louder card, temps are pretty okay but it definitely gets loud.",Oathbreaker,1
"alright cool. yeah, noise definitely isn't a big deal for me. as long as it's a solid card and gives the performance i want i'm all set aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah for sure. I know it can hit some higher FPS (120+) on Ultra depending on location and number of particles, but because I need them frames and stability I have mine set to low for the most part.",Oathbreaker,1
"same, i usually go with high for certain things, but yeah most of mine are on low-medium aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"EVGA is one of the best partner cards, I have a 1070 that I got in 2016 that just spits on everything",rozak,1
well looks like Microcenter has an EVGA 2070S for 519.99. which after rebate is 499.99.,thegoaliebear,1
i'll be there Friday tho so i'll check them all out aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear I went with the EVGA RTX 2070 Ultra and I'm extremely happy with it, zero issues (other than having to repartition an older, stubborn, dual drive system from GPT to EFI) and can run just about any game i've come across with max settings and beautiful frames (ARK Evolved almost made me cry).  It looks like Zotac got some good reviews at the cheapest price, but I don't know much about Zotac.  Zotac GPU is slightly shorter than the EVGA and only takes up 2 PCIe slots vs. EVGA @ 3 slots; so if space is a concern in your tower that's also something to consider.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
if you're looking at cooling EVGA got best marks for that,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
thanks! yeah i have the H500 case and it's been great. haven't had any issues with cooling and space isn't a problem either since i have a pretty simple set-up. but i'll take a look at each on Friday. i'm sure i'll be fine with either of the cards. honestly might just come down to appearance for me 😂,thegoaliebear,1
sometimes it be like that 😄,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"in fact, i picked my case with 100% SWTOR influence and custom painted it with a stormtrooper and Empire insignia.  absolutely necessary.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

Nice,obsoleteXeo (Grebe),1
damn 8yrs that's great you've kept that up so well! i'm excited to be making my first upgrade soon enough tho. but i made sure to do lots of future-proofing when i was picking my parts.,thegoaliebear,1
"also, i know someone will ask how i did the paint, so: found a SW themed font and images, printed them out in B/W. put painters tape on wax paper and then taped the B/W images to the painters tape.  Used an exacto knife to cut out images and then placed the stencil's in place and covered the rest with tape.  rustoleum spraypaint in several very light coats. viola!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
that's awesome haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"that is def the key, i spent a ton when i made this thing but I went for best longevity and left the door open for future components etc.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
for sure. it's definitely a big upfront investment. but totally worth it when you don't have to find yourself needing something new every year aha.,thegoaliebear,1

i have a 1700X and 1660 Ti @Skurrj (Pork Steeple),thegoaliebear,1
"and my gpu has been great. i usually average 80-95fps in D2. it works out tho bc i have a guy at my school who would want to buy my 1660 Ti, so that's an easy way to make back some cash on it lol.",thegoaliebear,1
"@Crizum it is an experience like no other lol, frustrations, all the trouble shooting you ever dreamed of, and the payoff is so sweet 😄 if you make the jump, hit me up, not saying i know everything but I work on PC's as a hobby and then turned that into my own lil side business for a while.  I've seen some shit and I'd be happy to help illuminate some dark corners.  A lot of it is trying to find an answer when you don't even know what the question is.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

I had that adjustment in Destiny. I always thought it looked pretty good and ran decently on console until I put a few hours in on pc. I got a little dizzy just putting my FPS to 30 for the dungeon,Crizum,1

Never really had eye strain issues, have 20/13 vision, so Mom can fuck off with that ""you sit in front of that thing way too much, it's going to make you go blind"".  1/2 a lifetime in front of ""that thing"", look at me now ma! 😛",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

So what you can actually do if you desire is load up one of the solo nightfalls or load in to a 950 and just do public events on the destination,Crizum,1

Don't full court and spike buff different things? Full court buffing the explosion damage while spike buffs the impact damage?,Infernosi,1
yeah,flipd,1
Ideally you still want both,flipd,1
theoretically spike will buff your base impact dmg and full court will buff your explosion dmg.... if you're far enough,flipd,1
a spike with zero blast radius will still do less damage than a spike w/ full court and zero blast radius,flipd,1
"let me describe a brief interaction i just had with a titan:

- i pick up heavy ammo for black talon (need sword kills for bounty)
- opposing titan and i turn corner and come face to face
- i swing silly exotic metal stick, titan presses his almighty and unstoppable melee key
- both attacks land
- i die from bs titan melee and fizzle into arc energy
- chad titan walks away at full health and only missing the overshield he had thanks to OEM

for those of you who don't know, i really, *really*, ***REALLY***  hate titans",Pentan,1
You a warlock?,Crizum,1
yup @Crizum,Pentan,1
Yeah warlocks get shafted. If you had a hunter I was gonna suggest the arc battery build. I was able to tank a golden gun shot with it. That honestly felt dirtier than any time I’ve used OEM,Crizum,1
I just wish warlocks could get into a melee fight and feel like they'll stand a chance.,Infernosi,1
handheld super nova is just super melee,Buttkikker,1
I recently played on titan for a bit and the reliability of their punches are so much more noticeable.,Infernosi,1
It takes charge up and leads to trades when people know to keep their distance.,Infernosi,1
It's more like a short range fusion,Infernosi,1
D1 Titans has baby arms,Crizum,1
lol wut,Buttkikker,1
Haha you don’t remember the T-Rex Titan days?,Crizum,1
"It wasn’t so much that they had baby arms I think, but warlocks had range and speed?",Crizum,1
"@Pentan as a warlock main/only i feel that pain on a personal level.  Keep your eyes out for that overshield and the fact that they like to run into your bullets, as soon as you see that charge put some distance between you, nade the ground, double jump backwards and unload a full clip of recluse in their face; whatever you can do... sometimes they get you, sometimes you get them",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"yeah warlocks could cross-map with their melees in D1, while titan melee seemed normal and actually balanced the 1-hit ability",Pentan,1
warlock melee was op tho,Pentan,1
"my bad. lol, lemme explain some shit you know way more about than me",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"for a change of pace you could go momentum control and run jade rabbit, no one gets close to anything there",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"lol nah you good, i just didn't feel like replying because you're right and i hated the idea of acknowledging the fact that, to stand a chance against a titan that's just holding W, i have to immediately double jump, use my 1min cooldown grenade, and still pray that i come out on top",Pentan,1
I think the problem is the tuned melee way down overall and in Forsaken buffed the sprint melees titans have to make them worth the wind up but now we’re left with only one class that can one hit melee,Crizum,1
i also feel that suppression grenades are definitely worth mentioning,Pentan,1
"I might be lucky, but I don't get nailed by one punch titans as much as reddit/interwebs would have me believe.  I'm just a blueberry but I don't feel it's extremely unbalanced.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

I will remind you that pre-forsaken Hunters were like 70+% of the playerbase. OEM just crystallizes and focuses hate on to Titans,Crizum,1
"tbh i rolled with MIDA scout most of the time for that radar, and kept the fuck away.  I read up on a pretty lengthy pvp encyclopedia a guy made on reddit.  Started out by saying: stay alive.  dedicated a whole page to that one thing and then said ""go play 2 games, just focusing on surviving encounters, record your play, and evaluate.  rest of the guide was great too, but that bit of advice, alone, changed my W/L and gameplay dramatically",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) if you haven’t already started on Randy’s try to get it done while Momentum Control is up for the scout rifle kills. That is honestly the longest grind.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9q41SwDf2CU,Crizum,1
I did use misfit to finish the auto rifle part of last season's Iron Banner quest,RonInDune,1
Honestly I would rather get waterboarded than use it again,RonInDune,1
"On Sunday we should do the one tether method, just finished the raid with it and it’s honestly way easier than two tethers and far less hectic",Crizum,1
Assuming three people have  normal/enhanced relay defender,Crizum,1
i always have those mods on for the raid lol.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah same here,RonInDune,1
"People at first didn’t know how close they needed to be, so only two of us got the buff and we still did half it’s health in one phase, when everyone knew where to stand for the second dps phase he lasted all of five seconds",Crizum,1
what is it just do the first tether and then dps.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, three people activate first tether to bring him down while everyone else hugs the other relay and does dps as soon as they can, other three join in instead of building second tether",Crizum,1
kk.,thegoaliebear,1
You don’t have to deal with the second tether being bugged or glitched,Crizum,1
I have relay defender but not the enhanced version.  I like the sound of this strat 🙂,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
whats a good exotic to run with devour warlock?,Spitfire2266,1
Nezerac's sin for armor IMO,Oathbreaker,1
Contraverse or Nezarec's sin for sure,RonInDune,1
cool,Spitfire2266,1
"Oh man, nezarec’s with double breach refractor on your chest and recluse",Crizum,1
i feel like i should be using devour more,Spitfire2266,1
It’s so fun,Crizum,1
are you guys planning a garden run tonight want to get it done,Spitfire2266,1
"by the way, this clip with double seventh columns with jade rabbit is insane

My god those spawns,Crizum,1
!gos,Crizum,1
"Depending on when I can run it maybe @Spitfire2266, but Thursday I call destiny early at like 7 pst",Crizum,1
BREAD ACQUIRED,Trissin,1
Congrats!!!,RonInDune,1
Congrats man!,Oathbreaker,1
Ty!!,Trissin,1
Nicely done!,Infernosi,1
"lfg 9th branch, @.me",Pentan,1
2070 Super is secured fam🔥,thegoaliebear,1
It's a good card! Great for VR as well,RonInDune,1
Plus you get to actually use RTX,RonInDune,1
now i get to have the fun of switching out the cards haha.,thegoaliebear,1
heyo! gratz @thegoaliebear hope it goes smooth and you're enjoying beautiful pixels soon,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
hah thanks i can't wait!,thegoaliebear,1
"Well, I’m stuck on the 2nd boss in Shattered Throne.  I started chasing down purifying a piece of dreaming gear for the buff mod but realized I can only get 1 (a week). I don’t see 5% damage increase making that bastard soloable for me.  Anyone else need to complete Shattered Throne run for izanagi’s or otherwise and want to team up?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Oof the festival of the lost costume contest winners are out and every single one of them is amazing,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1192552896023252992,RonInDune,1
"agreed! Especially that momentum control, love it",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) I can help you finish it up if you're still working towards it,Infernosi,1
"@Infernosi much appreciated, i got my 1 mod, woohoo 😉 when is a good time for you?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
In maybe 15-30 minutes?,Infernosi,1
"sounds like a plan, i'll be here and ty!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Looks like i WILL be getting Izanagi's today thanks to @Infernosi! made Shattered throne and the hardmode pyramidion parts of that quest a veritable cake walk, thanks again!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Happy to give a helping hand! Do enjoy it on that 980 nightfall.,Infernosi,1
nice @Skurrj (Pork Steeple) !!! Sorry wasn't around to help out,Trissin,1
"no worries 🙂 I still gotta heroic menagerie for the catalyst at some point, if anyone needs to do it too pm me and we'll get something going for it",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
time to hit the range 🙂,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Is anyone else not seeing any drops from Altar of Sorrow?,RonInDune,1
Unless I'm somehow missing them or they're going straight to the postmaster,RonInDune,1
@Skurrj (Pork Steeple) let's do the 980 NF on monday with Crizum if the time works out! would love to knock that out.,thegoaliebear,1
"so i am just making sure i have all the info right for when i get to install this bad boy:
-it says i need a 6 pin and 8 pin connector. i have the 8 pin on my 1660ti right now (the 6 pin +2), so essentially i would just shift that over to the 2070S and then plug in the extra 6 pin i have dangling there correct? (semi modular psu that 6 pin has just been chillin next to my gpu lol).

-i know i have to uninstall the 1660 drivers before swapping it out. so once i install the new 2070S i just turn on my PC, go to Nvidias site and download the 2070S drivers from there right?",thegoaliebear,1
1. Yes,Peronix,1
"2. Once you uninstall the old drivers, yea you can just install the new drivers through Geforce Experience",Peronix,1
okay perfect. thanks! seems simple enough. just a bit nervous since it's my first time making an upgrade. which is ironic since i built the thing😂,thegoaliebear,1
No problem! I understand the fear; I've built many Pcs and still get scared opening up my PC,Peronix,1
and also...this thing is a UNIT.,thegoaliebear,1
thicc as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
NVIDIA knows how to make some c h o n k y cards,Peronix,1
it is a very chonky boi. deadass like a burger.,thegoaliebear,1
We talking double quarter pounder or big mac?,Peronix,1
double quarter pounder. the thicc patties.,thegoaliebear,1
but i can't wait haha. it's so beautiful😩,thegoaliebear,1
Beautiful cards lead to beautiful frames👌,Peronix,1
I was really happy with how the 1660Ti handled D2. honestly the best mid range card on the market rn. but...i had the chance to upgrade.,thegoaliebear,1
and this guy at my school is deadass trading me these fancy ass Bose headphones for the 1660 haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Any sherpa raid run planned for this weekend?,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
we just have a raid tomorrow night. but i should be back to my apt today. I'd be down for a raid tonight. which one were you thinking?,thegoaliebear,1
"@thegoaliebear Monday is great, I’m flexible on times so whatever is best for y’all.  Have you performed the transplant yet?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I'm gonna do it this evening when I'm back aha.,thegoaliebear,1
but monday evening I'm good any time from like 6:30 est onward.,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I'm up for anything besides forsaken raid. Only raid I ran is Leviathan,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
i mean...eater of worlds is super fun and easy. do you not have forsaken?,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't, I missed it",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
no worries. I'd be happy to do an Eater of Worlds run tonight if others are available. it's very quick and easy.,thegoaliebear,1
"Cool, I'm down",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
what time is good for you? I'm free anytime after 8 est tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
"I might have some people who are interested in eater, you might remember Ryden and Hatless from the last run @Sarsante - 76561197967628966",Trissin,1
"And I think @RonInDune likes eater of worlds, maybe he can join up as well",Trissin,1
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @thegoaliebear is around ~8:15 a good start time tonight?,Trissin,1
I will be bringing two others who have not done eater before,Trissin,1
sounds good to me.,thegoaliebear,1
"So it might be a little bit longer than usual, but I don't think we'll have any problems",Trissin,1
Heck yeah Eater is great!,RonInDune,1
Especially since we have the 69+ completion specialist as well as the two person completion specialists with us,RonInDune,1
:o @thegoaliebear 69 completions of eater??,Trissin,1
hahaha yeah Y1 was a dark time.,thegoaliebear,1
"I’m too impatient for solo flawless, looks like I need someone to run the dungeon with lol",Crizum,1
Doesn’t help that this place keeps randomly killing me via load screens or short falls o.O,Crizum,1
The load screen bug does not disrupt flawless,Trissin,1
"Idk about falling though, just gotta be safe I guess",Trissin,1
"I got it during the very first drop, didn’t seem like the same load screen bug?",Crizum,1
Just before I hit the floor it gave me the death screen and loaded me in front of the first rally point haha,Crizum,1
Didn’t lose progress so it wasn’t a big deal,Crizum,1
The transition between necropolis and tunnels after the doors?,Trissin,1
"If it just kills you and you don't get ""your light fades away"" then it's not counted towards flawless",Trissin,1
No the very first darkness zone in necropolis,Crizum,1
oh that's strange,Trissin,1
are you dying like midair?,Trissin,1
"It gave me the log he fades away, never seen it before so idk how it happened haha",Crizum,1
Because those falls will kill u,Trissin,1
You know the first area with all the green glow in between the cracks on the ground?,Crizum,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Before necropolis,Trissin,1
I hit the warlock brakes at a usually safe distance and just got “your light fades away” before I hit the ground,Crizum,1
"wow, that's very weird yeah",Trissin,1
supposedly the fix for that is to change your FPS to 30,flipd,1
then change it back after you get past that area,flipd,1
I think that's a different area,Trissin,1
But it doesn't hurt to try,Trissin,1
Does that happen every single time?,Trissin,1
"No, first and last time I’ve seen it haha",Crizum,1
Ou ok,Trissin,1
"Then I guess, when it doesn't happen",Trissin,1
You've got a shot for flawless,Trissin,1
you got this!,Trissin,1
"Yeah it’s honestly just me getting impatient, I’ve never died directly to ogres in the pit but I’ve jumped off the same cliff like 4 times lol",Crizum,1
If I got stuck in a cave with 2 ogres covering both sides,Trissin,1
I literally pulled out my phone and just waited,Trissin,1
im also going for solo flawless,Buttkikker,1
Yes @Buttkikker !!!,Trissin,1
Glad to see so many people taking up these challenges now,Trissin,1
furthest ive gotten is halfway through the chamber of suffering?,Buttkikker,1
Ooh that's nearly there!,Trissin,1
the one with the capture point,Buttkikker,1
"The totem, right?",Trissin,1
ye,Buttkikker,1
What were u running?,Trissin,1
Subclass & weapons wise,Trissin,1
devour warlock,Buttkikker,1
and im trying to remember my loadout,Buttkikker,1
"I think it was izanagi, a tyranny of heaven, and 21%",Buttkikker,1
ooh interesting,Trissin,1
"I'll be going for it too, eventually.",Oathbreaker,1
"ive swapped since to tranquility, le monarque and 21%",Buttkikker,1
That and Shattered Throne solo flawless.,Oathbreaker,1
^ 👊 props,Trissin,1
"@Buttkikker I used Izanagi's, recluse, and 21%",Trissin,1
I just like the range and high damage of a bow recluse is so short ranged,Buttkikker,1
"I’m using Izanagi’s/recluse/love and death, may swap love and death for 21%",Crizum,1
especially for the chamber of suffering,Buttkikker,1
I think the main thing to recognize is that you don't have to be on that totem 24/7,Trissin,1
The main reason for recluse is double breach refractor,Crizum,1
It's actually pretty generous,Trissin,1
You can roam around and seek cover from the fires and boomers,Trissin,1
ill give recluse another try because i'd love to use izanagi,Buttkikker,1
"Yeah, Izanagi's was super good for one shotting the orb knights",Trissin,1
And recluse is good because double breach refactor,Trissin,1
"means more granades to eat, and more heavy ammo for delirium",Trissin,1
yeah it's always nice to have the nade up,Buttkikker,1
try for solo flawless ST after pit! It's a bit of a different experience,Trissin,1
I've confidence you can do them both,Trissin,1
how is it difficulty wise compared to pit?,Buttkikker,1
"Pit is glorified ad clear, imo",Trissin,1
ST is a bit more mechanics/boss oriented,Trissin,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
Vorgeth I would say is the main obstacle,Trissin,1
It's about watching your positioning and playing safe,Trissin,1
And then the boss is a game of being aware of your surroundings,Trissin,1
the biggest issue for me with ST is my lack of experience,Buttkikker,1
so very changeable,Buttkikker,1
Ah,Trissin,1
Maybe read some guides or watch others I guess? But I think the best way to learn is to just try,Trissin,1
Hahaha ohh nooo,Crizum,1
Titan main on warlock. Did y’all know nova bomb kills you? That’s dumb,Crizum,1
The knight stopped backing up and yolo’d in my face,Crizum,1
daang,Buttkikker,1
yeah itl do that,Buttkikker,1
"Think for my sanity I’ll do a solo, then maybe a group run with no death, then focus on flawless for the emblem later",Crizum,1
welp im back in the chamber of suffering,Buttkikker,1
any tips?,Buttkikker,1
Find cover if you need to!,Trissin,1
with recluse whats the best way to take out acolytes?,Buttkikker,1
I leave the really far ones for the most part,Trissin,1
If I feel threatened I'll eat a grenade and just use delirium,Trissin,1
"as long as you have enough delirium ammo for the boomers, no need to save ammo",Trissin,1
ok,Buttkikker,1
Ooh wait it looks like my msg didn't send,Trissin,1
With recluse I leave the totem and get in their faces lol,Trissin,1
i used a double MG reseves for the flag and then swapped back to breach refractor     so i have 455 delerium ammo,Buttkikker,1
ooh that's clever,Trissin,1
Do you have hive armaments?,Trissin,1
not 2.0 sadly,Buttkikker,1
"That's okay, I don't have 2.0 either",Trissin,1
I used a few armor 1.0 pieces for armaments and barrier,Trissin,1
"Always do the menagerie 3 times a week on every character, you can get hive armaments",RonInDune,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
I really should do that too,Trissin,1
And also run last wish and scourge,Trissin,1
i did last week and ive done some this week,Buttkikker,1
for last wish just do the free chest 3 times a week,Buttkikker,1
i got armaments,Buttkikker,1
I'm really down to every raid honestly,RonInDune,1
and nahkriin got spec and armaments,Buttkikker,1
ooh by the way Ron is 7:15 CT a good time for you tonight?,Trissin,1
yup yup,RonInDune,1
Okay sweet we good,Trissin,1
Good luck @Buttkikker !!!,Trissin,1
ty,Buttkikker,1
is there a section in the geforce experience app that allows you to uninstall your current drivers?,thegoaliebear,1
eh I just use a DDU,RonInDune,1
"Use the DDU to uninstall, then shutdown, then put in the 2070 then start up adn reboot and geforce should handle the rest",RonInDune,1
okay cool.,thegoaliebear,1
"and just to to be on the safe side, create a system restore point before starting",RonInDune,1
i just never used DDU before and heard it's not really necessary so idk.,thegoaliebear,1
like which options should i have selected.,thegoaliebear,1
ah well you cna uninstall from the control panel then,RonInDune,1
i would probs be more comfortable with that haha.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah that works as well,RonInDune,1
so from control panel i just uninstall all my previous nvidia files for the game ready drivers and GFE correct?,thegoaliebear,1
just the graphics driver,RonInDune,1
so from this list. the one that says graphics driver 441 is all i need to take out?,thegoaliebear,1
sorry for all questions haha just want to make sure i'm doing this totally right 😂,thegoaliebear,1
"yup that's right, your system will go kinda weird right after as the motherboard display driver takes over",RonInDune,1
It's all good,RonInDune,1
okay cool.,thegoaliebear,1
godspeed fam.,thegoaliebear,1
"nothing can possibly go wrong, you got this",RonInDune,1
haha i hope. i read up last night and seems like gpu's are the easiest major piece to swap.,thegoaliebear,1
yup,RonInDune,1
alright so drivers confirmed uninstalled. now just gotta shut it down and get to work lol.,thegoaliebear,1
yup good start!,RonInDune,1
updates to come haha.,thegoaliebear,1
@Trissin 8:15 CST?,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"7:15 central, 8:15 eastern",Trissin,1
does that work for u?,Trissin,1
alright...new GPU is in...Nvidia installing everything now. i. am. READY.,thegoaliebear,1
heck yeah!!,RonInDune,1
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966,Trissin,1
my PSUs extra 6+2 pin was attached in such a potato way i had to open up the back of my PC and reroute the cable so both would fit😂,thegoaliebear,1
this GPU is a monster tho.,thegoaliebear,1
"It's an excellent card, very future proof",RonInDune,1
"and i have to say...even tho it's noisier, having the side panel off of the case is quite aesthetically pleasing. especially when i booted it back up.",thegoaliebear,1
look very cyberpunk that way yeah,RonInDune,1
this card is large and in charge.,thegoaliebear,1
and it knows it too.,thegoaliebear,1
ok this nvidia is taking forever tho😂,thegoaliebear,1
it does,RonInDune,1
"i got a pop up thing for a ""windows host process"" after i selected to do a clean install. one of those ""origin hard drive on this computer thing"". do i select yes? bc i selected no and it stopped the install😂",thegoaliebear,1
i am such a noob.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm not sure what that was honestly, can you get a screenshot?",RonInDune,1
If you've gotten past it that's fine,RonInDune,1
or should i be okay without selecting clean install?,thegoaliebear,1
i can start it again and see if i get it.,thegoaliebear,1
nah always do clean install,RonInDune,1
avoids having the issue with multiple cards being left installed,RonInDune,1
oh wait nvm there it goes.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Trissin probably not, division 2 raid speedruns scheduled to start at 5:30 cst. Another clan took our 2nd place there.",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
that was weird. maybe it was windows trying to install its own driver? i saw that that can happen @RonInDune,thegoaliebear,1
yeah usually windows installs its own driver if given a choice,RonInDune,1
uh,Trissin,1
what,Trissin,1
_confuse_,Trissin,1
it's the same nvidia driver,RonInDune,1
just without geforce experience,RonInDune,1
ah...all finished!,thegoaliebear,1
yay!,RonInDune,1
"I speedrun the division 2 raid, we had second best time in the world there. Some european dudes beat our time",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
refreshing to see my.monitor go back to 144hz 😂,thegoaliebear,1
"Damn, thats crazy!",Trissin,1
I don't mind pushing back the start time,Trissin,1
I'm sure the rest are okay too?,Trissin,1
yeah i'm good,RonInDune,1
yeah i'm fine with whatever. i don't have anything tomorrow anyway so will probs be up late anyway.,thegoaliebear,1
cool,Trissin,1
Around when is good for you sarsante?,Trissin,1
"Fun fact is one chinese clan also beat us doing the fastest run by a large margin but we think they cheated. Fastest team has 7:36, then 8:02 and my team has 8:04. So we will rry beat a sub 8 minutes run tonight",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Idk for how long we will run. I would say find another player, I would hate to make yoou wait",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
don't tell me that's 8 hours,Trissin,1
:o,Trissin,1
"Nope, probably 4-6... Depends a lot when people tilt and give up lol",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Ooh wait I missed the ""minutes"" part",Trissin,1
Mbmb,Trissin,1
I misread what you wrote,Trissin,1
hahaha here I was thinking division raid speedruns took upwards of 7 hours,Trissin,1
"Okay, I think we'll find someone to fill in then, 4-6 hours might be a bit long of a wait",Trissin,1
next time! And good luck on your speedrun!,Trissin,1
"Thanks, have fun",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"If somehow we stop early I'll let you know, but probably won't happen",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

@Destiny [PC] we have a spot open for an EoW run tonight if anyone wants a blast from the past.,thegoaliebear,1
Anybody in for a levi run? We're on Alpha,flipd,1
just need 1 more,1minatur,1
"Just woke up from a nap but if either raid still needs some additional pew pew (albeit i've never ran levi or EoW, so i will need instruction) i'm down for some fun 🙂",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

"hell yeah @thegoaliebear , OMW @1minatur",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
is 8:15 est still a good time for people to do EoW?,thegoaliebear,1
That's like an hour and a half from now  right?,RonInDune,1
yes,Trissin,1
Yeah I'm good then,RonInDune,1
sweet.,thegoaliebear,1
Okay cool getting kicked to orbit but coming back in doesn’t count for completing pit solo,Crizum,1
bungo is true final boss,Trissin,1
but you got it done solo! congrats!,Trissin,1
solo flawless is not much harder,Trissin,1
Honestly I’m just gonna do it on Titan lol,Crizum,1
lol I feel that,Trissin,1
as a titan main,Trissin,1
warlock was not for me,Trissin,1
Devour warlock is fun but I’m sure a modified Monte Carlo loadout will do just as much work,Crizum,1
just main warlock lol,Buttkikker,1
idk about that one,Trissin,1
warlock is so op,Trissin,1
Most of my boss dps came from anarchy and the weaken grenades,Crizum,1
thats what I did too,Trissin,1
"throw a nade, nova bomb, stick anarchy",Trissin,1
and just ignore the boss lol,Trissin,1
reapply anarchy as needed,Trissin,1
Yeah lol,Crizum,1
3 damage phases was more than enough,Trissin,1
Thinking that with weapons of light,Crizum,1
"I guess you dont really need to be a lock for the boss, yeah",Trissin,1
It’s apparently supposed to be done in one sitting,Crizum,1
but for the totem,Trissin,1
"Well, the totem would probably be the hardest part",Crizum,1
"yeah, that's the most difficult part of the run",Trissin,1
and I am not sure if I could do it without devour yet,Trissin,1
I'd have to practice,Trissin,1
You were planning to use monte carlo?,Trissin,1
"You don’t have devour so it’s a bit iffy, but you do get rallying force",Crizum,1
"I dunno I’d need to think about it. The melee refresh is nice, plus marakov chain, it’s a lot of punching",Crizum,1
"Combine it with something silly like one eye mask, swapping to saint-14 when you use super, decent sustain but not as passive as devour",Crizum,1
Oh I didn't even think about OEM,Trissin,1
Or maybe go with striker and skull fort?,Crizum,1
those are all really interesting ideas,Trissin,1
it might not be as bad as I'd thought,Trissin,1
how yall doing with levi @Skurrj (Pork Steeple),thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear about to nut on flowers and bitten by dogs it sounds like,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

"@Trissin thank you as well and everyone else, I really enjoyed those raids 🙂 I think i did the typical male thing towards the end of that when @thegoaliebear was asking for the ball: assumed everything in front of me was adds and was looking at everything in the back of the fridge.  as soon as I died you were right there in plain sight 😛",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

just that one.,thegoaliebear,1
"because I have two others with me and we cant find a team, wondering of there are 3 more willing to run. Its our first time through",Yeti,1
there's definitely enough who have done it before willing to help. depends on their availability. can always try setting up a post.,thegoaliebear,1

microcenter has the 2700X on sale for $130. jesus...if i didn't just drop $500 I'd get that too😂,thegoaliebear,1

"Never had an AMD CPU in my PC, always felt Intel was a superior chip temp wise and under load, but I’ve heard friends say in recent years that AMD has made great strides that rival, and in some cases surpass.  Have you (Goal and anyone else placing a larger demand on their CPU) found that to be true? My only experience with AMD chips was at work and in both cases IT replaced the towers with Intel because (apparently) AMD had a rough time doing what I needed it to do (simultaneous AutoCAD, 3D rendering, and large data transfer).",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I've found amd is geared towards multi core applications.,LW Mugetsu,1
yes. i stream and game from my PC and I've never had any hiccups. the 8 cores/16 threads make it a no brainer.,thegoaliebear,1
Intel is strong for most single core activities like gaming,LW Mugetsu,1
if you are solely gaming then Intel is *marginally* better.,thegoaliebear,1
"but if you are running multiple programs at once, AMD is the go-to.",thegoaliebear,1
I've always preferred amd,LW Mugetsu,1
yeah i never even considered intel when building my PC. way too overpriced as well lol.,thegoaliebear,1
All the systems I've built have had amd,LW Mugetsu,1
"Which is my case today, back in the day they went with the new dual and quad core intels (dating myself) when they replaced, so it’s been a good while. I still have my unlocked i7 but can see the need to upgrade in the somewhat near future.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"i just think for the price to performance you get with AMD cpus these days it really can't be beat. but again, if you really only game on your PC intel gives a bit more performance in that sense.",thegoaliebear,1
The first processor I ever used for a build was an Athlon xp dual core,LW Mugetsu,1
but $130 for a 2700X is an unreal price haha...which is why i mentioned it,thegoaliebear,1
"Well I will overcome my habits and look at my needs with horse blinders off lol. Yeah that’s kinda what sparked my brain, that price seems crazy, like too good to be true",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
That what I'm using and it was around 200 when I got it,LW Mugetsu,1
unfortunately microcenter doesn't ship.,thegoaliebear,1
but if you have one reasonably close to you I'd definitely recommend giving them a look.,thegoaliebear,1
Definitely. I love going to microcenter,LW Mugetsu,1
I got a new monitor on Saturday destiny looks so good on it,Spitfire2266,1
Nice,LW Mugetsu,1
i can't be left alone in that store. first time i got all my PC parts. second time i came out with a new laptop. and most recently i walk out with a new gpu 😂 that store is dangerous as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
I’m guessing micro center similar to Fry’s? Like a electronics/PC Home Depot?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
We have memory express where I am,Spitfire2266,1
Gratz on the new monitor 😄,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
yes but like 100x better @Skurrj (Pork Steeple),thegoaliebear,1
Thanks!,Spitfire2266,1
"Yeah, I better not.  Like you said, those places are dangerous, and I’d leave all self control at the door.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
literally me lmao.,thegoaliebear,1

you gotta.,thegoaliebear,1

"Who am I kidding, unless colleges accept restaurant loyalty cards my kids will still be screwed",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
hahaha. the one close to me is in Cleveland which is like a 3.5 hour drive. so i can use it as an excuse to go to microcenter and see a musical that's playing there...double trouble haha,thegoaliebear,1
"Please pass the chips and culture, that sounds like time well spent.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Not a whole ton of that to be had here in Alabama, there are SOME things I miss about Cali.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

Would people be interested in 2-3 GoS runs tomorrow evening? We’ve got them down at a decent speed now and if people only have the one character we could rotate people in and out?,Crizum,1
yeha I can do that,RonInDune,1
I have 3 characters ready anyway,RonInDune,1
my 3 character are fine would only have time for 2 runs tho.,thegoaliebear,1
I just have my warlock but I don't mind running multiple time,LW Mugetsu,1

bloody hell the robots are rebelling,RonInDune,1
"@Destiny [PC] Depending on how quick the clears are we'll try multiple runs. We have the boss down pretty well, think it was the quickest encounter last night",Crizum,1
If people figure out the extra pinnacle drop we can attempt it if it isn't too crazy,Crizum,1
Also I wouldn't mind some more quick 3x scourge runs for anarchy,RonInDune,1

I still need to run that,LW Mugetsu,1
"Hell yeah, wtg @Buttkikker",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
@Crizum extra pinnacle drop? Is that the 2nd chest at the end that’s encrypted?  I tried looking that up after the raid & dungeon but only came up with solo run chest exploit videos,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"The challenge we did last night in the raid dropped an extra pinnacle reward for us, those challenges will cycle weekly",Crizum,1
"So I just mean if people figure out the second challenge tomorrow and it isn’t too bad we can try it, but I’m not going to hold up the run doing five attempts at it",Crizum,1
"Ah, gotcha.  Well how the hell does one get the access key to that other chest?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"That was for Divinity, only dropped cause we did the puzzles",Crizum,1

All those drops though 🤣 what a reward,Arixama,1
LOL i literally got the Osprey too it went to the postmaster hahaha,thegoaliebear,1
spent so much time on it. but so relieved we got it done.,thegoaliebear,1
How long did it take you?,Arixama,1
1hr 20mins lol.,thegoaliebear,1
the saving grace at the boss is that if you wipe you don't have to kill the barrier knights at the start again and again.,thegoaliebear,1
oh my god i forgot reset moved back,Arixama,1
Daylight savings time is evil,RonInDune,1
Yeah it really serves no purpose but way too many people want to keep it around,Crizum,1
It’s proof that people just want to argue about stuff lol,Crizum,1
"DST was slightly confusing for me to understand when I first came to the US, but my poor mum still doesn't get it. I understand its purpose, but I question its efficacy",RonInDune,1
I'm not sure I really understand it's purpose - why do we do it?,Trissin,1
"@thegoaliebear 😂 I’m not going to say it would be impossible if the 4 barrier nights had to be taken down again, but I’m pretty sure we’d have had to melee the boss down!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I think it's to save power because sunset occurs over a long period of time in countries as wide as Canada or the US,RonInDune,1
To give us an “extra” hour of daylight,Crizum,1
But it doesn’t make sense in an interconnected world,Crizum,1
"Gets dark at like 4pm here anyway when winter hits, what difference does it make if it’s dark at 3",Crizum,1
"It’s also weird because Hawaii and Arizona for sure don’t follow it, and I think California doesn’t either",Crizum,1
"Oh cool I just looked it up, germans started it and we’ve only had it since Nixon",Crizum,1
bloody germans,RonInDune,1
"And yeah you were kinda right Ron, it was to conserve energy during wartime efforts",Crizum,1
And we all thought Nixon's biggest crime was Watergate.,Peronix,1
lol,Trissin,1
"Originally daylight saving was proposed by Ben Franklin (as a friggen joke), but stayed alive and was first adopted by Germany in WWI as a means to stay “more productive” in daylight hours.  For various reasons, other countries began following suit, but generally the reasoning is “more productivity”.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Huh, hey @RonInDune since you’re a lore/story person apparently the raid designer for guild wars 2 joined Bungie as narrative department manager",Crizum,1
Oooooh,RonInDune,1
Don’t YOU feel more productive now that we’ve fucked with your sleep patterns?  I’d like an estimate on the total number of hours humanity has wasted by changing all their clocks.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Having different time zones within the same country is complicated enough lol,RonInDune,1
America is too big,Crizum,1
"Isn’t the old joke you could drive 7 hours and go across different countries in Europe, or you could drive 7 hours and still be in Texas",Crizum,1
We need Wyomingexit,RonInDune,1
"That is very true, Texas is just way too big",RonInDune,1
Just push Florida away,Peronix,1
"It’s like a 14 hour drive to see my father-in-law, and he’s one state away",Crizum,1
Florida has Disney Land! Non negotiable,RonInDune,1
What's the state where Fargo is set in?,RonInDune,1
All they have is snow,RonInDune,1
North Dakota?,Crizum,1
"Yeah, merge the Dakotas",RonInDune,1
"I’ve driven from Cali to Alabama several times now and I agree with that statement.  For some reason, New Mexico seems to drag on 3x longer than Texas on I-40.  Took me 28 hrs to get to Arkansas with only 3x 30 min naps.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
bloody hell,RonInDune,1
Why aren't there that many trains here anyway?,RonInDune,1
I don't think I've seen a single passenger train here in Texas,RonInDune,1
Lack of trained engineers,Peronix,1
huh,RonInDune,1
We didn’t really heavily invest in them? Car culture is a big part of it,Crizum,1
Or even a railroad track now that I think about it,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"That's true, there's lots of cars here",RonInDune,1
"In areas that have lots of public transportation issues we have stuff like bart/light rail/max which go throughout the big cities, and California was trying for awhile",Crizum,1
I joked that I saw more cars coming out of the Houston airport then I've seen in my entire life in India,RonInDune,1
But nobody wants to give up land,Crizum,1
"Gotta say America tends to find one solution to a problem and stop there sometimes, we got planes why you also want trains?",Crizum,1
lol,RonInDune,1
"And “we’ve given everyone electricity, I mean, it’s all tied together and vulnerable as hell, but you can cook hot pockets.  Unless you live in California, no hot pockets for you”",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Yeah we can’t contact my wife’s 90 year old grandparents right now cause they got their power shut off for the fire hazard,Crizum,1
Because it’s easier to shut off power to avoid a lawsuit then spend any of the companies money on upgrading and fixing infrastructure,Crizum,1
That's terrible!,RonInDune,1
They’re already $13B in the hole for damages so far.  It’s mainly due to faulty infrastructure that’s fallen into disrepair.  When those big winds hit (and they always do) the sparks go flying.  I don’t know how they’re going to fix such a huge problem.  Elec bills in Cali are sky high as it is.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Water is an obvious issue too, L.A. was built in the middle of the damn desert and has it’s water coming from as far away as Arizona.  They ship their sewage to northern counties and pay them to handle it.  I love Cali, it’s beautiful, but the list of reasons I got the hell out and will never go back is very long.  Definitely worried for my friends and family there and wish they all would relocate out of state.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Yeah we moved north, can’t get in to Canada so we settled on northern Oregon. It’s nice",Crizum,1
I've stayed in Davis for a few months and it's really beautiful but the forest fire warnings were wild,RonInDune,1
Northern Cali up through British Columbia is by far my favorite region of the country.  Had I not met my wife and moved to the south I would likely be in Oregon or Washington near my sis.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I mean the sex shops alone are a huge draw,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I want to go whale watching in Washington state one day,RonInDune,1
Anyone who hasn’t been on the i5 is wondering what you’re talking about but I’m cracking up,Crizum,1
"I know, it’s a very inside joke! I feel like you can’t go 10 miles without passing at least one though.
@RonInDune very good goal to have, it is a one of a kind experience.  Also, if you’re into seafood, Seattle has the best oysters you’ll find anywhere and the smoked salmon... oh boy, lox bagels... I miss them all",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I loved the seafood in SanFran but honestly it felt horribly overpriced,RonInDune,1
I'll keep that in mind if I go to Seattle!,RonInDune,1
"Oh San Fran is a dying beast, it’s depressing",Crizum,1
"San Fran is horribly overpriced, yes",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"@Crizum but hey, the city will give you clean needles and a place to stay when you wanna binge out on some heroin 👍",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Yeah it's strange to see a big city like SF to have such a homeless people problem,RonInDune,1
Isn’t that Seattle too?,Crizum,1
I had panhandlers harassing me outside the Mozilla office,RonInDune,1
"Seattle is pretty bad too in places but I think SF has taken the crown there.  They seem to encourage homelessness in SF and have said all are welcome.  It’s not a black and white issue, but I feel that SF has enabled the homeless lifestyle to a point that, to some it’s a viable and enticing way to live.  People can make a decent chunk of money panhandling (sometimes much more than a 9-5), their drug use is pretty much encouraged, and there’s zero reason to do anything else.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Eeps, didn’t mean to hijack the forum and rant so much. On a lighter note, we got some freezing rain here in northern AL last night.  If you squinted your eyes it almost looked like snow",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
we currently have 5 inches of snow lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
In Florida ?!?!!,RonInDune,1
no lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Cuse.,thegoaliebear,1
i wish i was in FL.,thegoaliebear,1
Ah that makes more sense,RonInDune,1
but i still have to graduate. sadly stuck here until May💀,thegoaliebear,1
It's 40° F here in SE Texas and I'm absolutely freezing. I cannot deal with the cold lol,RonInDune,1
"Yeah I don’t miss living in places where several feet of snow exists all winter long..  but a little, every once in a blue moon, is pretty and enjoyable",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
currently 25F feels like 5F tho,thegoaliebear,1
Lol @RonInDune I stick out like a sore thumb here.  I’m that guy that’s comfortable in shorts and a t-shirt when everyone else is 7-layers of fuck this shit,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
It was mid 70's yesterday afternoon and now in the high 30's low 40's here and it sucks.,LW Mugetsu,1
I would literally never step outdoors if it were 5F jesus christ,RonInDune,1
oh that's not even the worst of it.,thegoaliebear,1
we'll start getting into the minuses pretty soon.,thegoaliebear,1
i think -45F with the wind chill was the coldest we got last winter,thegoaliebear,1
Are you lot descendants of the Abominable snowman or what,RonInDune,1
"Ooof, that’s when the wind cuts right through to your soul like an icy knife. Feel like your lungs ice over every time you inhale",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I went on the Mount Everest base camp trek twice and it was around 25F and I almost died,RonInDune,1
"Jesus, -45???! I can’t imagine how utterly impossible it would be to exist in that",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
they usually cancels classes if it gets that cold.,thegoaliebear,1
"Like, damnit! MA!! The liquid nitrogen is frozen over again!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"but we always, *always* still have practice bc our coach doesn't give a shit about us :)))",thegoaliebear,1
I can handle hot weather way better than cold. I'm fine with 101 but you can shove sub 50's.,LW Mugetsu,1
"Exactly, I have done days and days of fieldwork at >120F and I managed. I can't do cold at all",RonInDune,1
Is your coach the evil principal from Matilda?,RonInDune,1
worse.,thegoaliebear,1
Lol,LW Mugetsu,1
i will just put it this way - my experience with division one athletics is literally what made me decide to go to graduate school for a degree in counseling.,thegoaliebear,1
Oof,RonInDune,1
Well their loss is your gain,RonInDune,1
Ouch,LW Mugetsu,1
i don't have a single friend that has enjoyed it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
misery loves company. we have great stories tho of all the shit we've been through 😂,thegoaliebear,1
That sounds kinda cruel,RonInDune,1
Very military boot camp-ish,RonInDune,1
very much. especially considering a lot of coaches genuinely do not give a shit about their player's mental health.,thegoaliebear,1
our coach literally makes us feel like it's our fault if we get injured 😂,thegoaliebear,1
bloody hell,RonInDune,1
i am looking forward to March more than you will ever know.,thegoaliebear,1
so i can be done with this haha.,thegoaliebear,1
and then i can have all the time i want to play Destiny! at least until grad school lolol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Solidarity, comrade!",RonInDune,1
Grad school is way way more relaxed lol,RonInDune,1
but it'll be so nice. able to work out when i want and not have to be on our ridiculous schedule.,thegoaliebear,1
"That freedom does come at a price of always having to set your own targets, but it's always nice having people treat you as an adult",RonInDune,1
I remember turning into a complete walrus during my first semester of grad school,RonInDune,1
i'm ready tbh haha. no more hockey to get in the way of literally everything.,thegoaliebear,1
"That reminds me, I've never seen an actual ice hockey match in a stadium. Wonder if Texas has any rinks",RonInDune,1
Yes they do,LW Mugetsu,1
Houston has a couple. 1 major sports rink and 1 or 2 minor,LW Mugetsu,1
I went to a game when Houston still had a hockey team,LW Mugetsu,1
also have an NHL team,thegoaliebear,1
in Dallas,thegoaliebear,1
Ok so the new challenge is pretty simple,RonInDune,1
Everyone just has to tether at the same time during the second encounter,RonInDune,1
so we wanna do that tonight yeah ?,thegoaliebear,1
"We can, it’ll just take some communication",Crizum,1
is this for every single time we have to tether to refresh our buffs?,thegoaliebear,1
yup,RonInDune,1
that's just tedious as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
it doesn't have to be at the same place,RonInDune,1
just at the same time,RonInDune,1
"we'll call out when tethering, everyone lines up wherever they are, and then the anchors shoot at the same time",RonInDune,1
"So basically three and floater would refresh at four, one and floated refresh at two with a countdown to tether?",Crizum,1
That sounds about correct,RonInDune,1
Sounds like the best way to do it is to all kinda gather by the tether box and then once everyone's tethered move to connect it,Arixama,1
!lfg search,RonInDune,1
I'm going to be more toward 8:30. don't get out of class until 745.,thegoaliebear,1
Takes awhile for people to start gathering anyway so you should be fine,Crizum,1
@Buttkikker relative of yours?,Crizum,1
LMAOOOO,Trissin,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
how tf is that not censored,Trissin,1
long lost brother,Buttkikker,1
Is it just you with a mustache? The evil twin?,Crizum,1
who says im not evil?,Buttkikker,1
HAHAHA,thegoaliebear,1
I'm dead,thegoaliebear,1

No idea but it was at least 4 blocks,LW Mugetsu,1

I'm down!,Peronix,1
I could,Crizum,1
If there's a spot and I find a decent not too expensive screen I could,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Woke up with a dead screen, pretty weird",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Wife won't allow me to play in our tv at 8pm,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

@RonInDune @Crizum remember our tumblr convo the other night? i dug something up.,thegoaliebear,1
how do I unsee something,Oathbreaker,1
Pinned a message.,Arixama,1
YOU CANT,Arixama,1
SUFFER ETERNALLY,Arixama,1
yall are my slutty squad.,thegoaliebear,1
y'all need some more incredible emoji pasta in your lives,RonInDune,1
I'm DEAD,thegoaliebear,1
HAHAHA,thegoaliebear,1
i love those so much and I'm not afraid to admit it. they're just hilarious.,thegoaliebear,1
It's a truly incredible subreddit: ||https://www.reddit.com/r/emojipasta/||,RonInDune,1
i don't regret joining that sub at all.,thegoaliebear,1
Hate this raid almost as much as I hate what you posted,Crizum,1
"Doing a run on warlock, getting the exact same drops I got last night",Crizum,1
dam,Buttkikker,1
its really stingy with loot,Buttkikker,1
Got a hoard of swashbuckler/rapid hit hand cannons,Crizum,1
"i have to drop from the raid tonight, sorry guys. i have a really long project section due tomorrow and i had no idea it was this fucking long lmao.",thegoaliebear,1
well good luck,Buttkikker,1
"All good, best of luck!",RonInDune,1
"i'm so fucking pissed about it. my prof assigned this and explained what to do the week i was out after i got my wisdom tooth out. so like, i'm already clueless as to what it should look like and i have to do fucking research too.",thegoaliebear,1
"so if you see me in a voice chat at like, midnight, it's just me crying lolol.",thegoaliebear,1
"Think I’m gonna drop out too. I just got four energy weapons in a row, which was already my highest slow, in addition to being trolled the whole way through the final boss with someone randomly popping cyclops and tethers",Crizum,1
ah well we can always run it tomorrow,RonInDune,1
for sure. we're not traveling this week so i got tomorrow evening and all of friday free.,thegoaliebear,1
I think you’ll still have 6 if skurjj and sarsante can make it,Crizum,1

actualy i think ill drop out too,Buttkikker,1

I'm down for tomorrow as well,LW Mugetsu,1

senioritis is setting in so hard but i just have to really grind it out for another four weeks.,thegoaliebear,1
"Idk if I can make it tonight, waiting wife sleep to kidnap the tv to play. Tomorrow I'll probably have the screen issue sorted out",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
no worries we had others drop as well. life and shit happens haha.,thegoaliebear,1
We cursed tonight's run with our bad memes,RonInDune,1
i love when windows doesn't even let me know i have an update ready so my laptop just freezes on me while I'm working on my project :))) this is why I'm a compulsive saver.,thegoaliebear,1
oof,RonInDune,1
"No big, got a bit of Gambit left to wrap up 🙂",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I signed up for tomorrow’s but if there was someone signed up for tonight’s that will make it tomorrow I’ll move into the alt spot for you,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"@thegoaliebear yep, I see you auto save, and I just don’t trust you’ve done your job well enough... ctrl+s",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
oh no i meant compulsive saver as in i hit ctrl s after every letter i type lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I have everything I write (especially papers that are on the publication track) in a git repo and I compulsively commit like every few minutes,RonInDune,1
My github profile is complete mess due to that sadly,RonInDune,1
"I tell my students to the same, but every semester there's always a bunch of people who are unable to submit assignments due to save failures lol",RonInDune,1
yeah i save everything i write as well. learned that from my mom haha. she still has her grad school statements that came very handy when i was writing mine lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Woah that's pretty cool,RonInDune,1
"well, i finished my project part lol. i have no idea if it's right tho 😂",thegoaliebear,1
"depends, what level bullshitter are you?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
i said the same thing 5 different ways in a 6 page paper and got an A so...i'd say i'm a pretty advanced bullshitter.,thegoaliebear,1
then it's right 😉,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
hahaha. love it.,thegoaliebear,1
"Hmm, how do you get progress for killing Undying Mind in vex offensive?",Trissin,1
I'm guessing you need to do something special to spawn it?,Trissin,1
"As of now, the Undying Mind isn't in the game, but he will be available starting next week",Peronix,1
Ohhhh ok,Trissin,1
Is anyone down to help me through the Zero Hour mission? Turns out soloing it requires a Master's in skill,Peronix,1
still one spot @Destiny [PC],thegoaliebear,1
"I'll try get the recluse before the raid, it will help my ad clear. Missing 8 wins",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
cool. it's fine if you don't have it there are plenty of things you can use.,thegoaliebear,1
"Im lacking void dmg for the shield, specially the harpy part. For final boss I want try riskrunner. I know they do void dmg but well there is the milk all over the place to keep the buff",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
And yeah I'm a stubborn try hard,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
riskrunner is a good option I've seen lots of people use it at the boss.,thegoaliebear,1
"if you don't get recluse today honestly, Valakdyn might not be a bad choice for ads aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"Yea, Recluse's power is overstated. If you want some REAL firepower, I got just the gun for you",Peronix,1
Lol,LW Mugetsu,1
the sound of misfit is so distinctive.,thegoaliebear,1
"It’s unmatched, *just like its power*",Peronix,1
I thought harpy shields were usually arc,LW Mugetsu,1
Minotaurs have void shields,LW Mugetsu,1
there really aren't a lot of shielded enemies in the raid. just the void minotaurs.,thegoaliebear,1
"@Peronix not sure if you’ve already gotten thru it but I need to complete it as well (tried soloing, nope).  If you want to team up, I’m available and we can do the damn thing 🙂",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Hell yeah!,Peronix,1
"i will be full support tonight with my warlock, well, and divinity c:",thegoaliebear,1
"hmm...i might actually look into getting emotes created that are like, cartoon versions of me lol. I'll keep the 3 bear emotes i have and add new ones from there.",thegoaliebear,1
"@LW Mugetsu it's to kill minotaurs faster, it was way too long of a battle imo",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 you have divinity right?,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah you guys got it for me last run,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"if you do, i would run that tonight and maybe use hammerhead in your heavy slot to take down the minotaurs fast.",thegoaliebear,1
Sounds like a plan,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah and with divinity you just use that during dps. just keep it firing at the boss for that damage multiplier bubble.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yep, I would suggest that because I've the lowest dps",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
aha don't worry too much about that. but divinity helps a lot so it's a great support weapon.,thegoaliebear,1
this also gives me the opportunity to use Revoker/Darci 😩😩,thegoaliebear,1
Oh hey Halo MCC will be on PC from Dec 4th,RonInDune,1
That's pretty cool,RonInDune,1
It's just Halo Reach to start out with btw,RonInDune,1
Graviton Lance works well on void shields and if you can get a kill with mobs bunched together you get a pretty impressive fireworks show,LW Mugetsu,1
Hey is anyone interested in doing time trial master nightmare hunts tonight?,Buttkikker,1
What time? I’ve been wanting to get those done but I usually am off around 7 pm pacific,Crizum,1
I should be on all day so whenever you are able to,Buttkikker,1
I’m also down whenever we can find a third,Crizum,1
Can be on whenever,Crizum,1
I'll be on around 6:15 for my stream I'm down to try them before the raid.,thegoaliebear,1
So apparently Anarchy is due to get a drop rate buff soon,RonInDune,1
well thats nice,Buttkikker,1
ouu interesting,Trissin,1
it's not like it hasn't been a year or anything 🙄 😂,thegoaliebear,1
"Reach is gonna be on steam and Gamepass, wonder if they’ll have the same playerbase or if it’s split",Crizum,1
How good was the multiplayer in Reach? It wasn't as popular as 3 was it?,RonInDune,1
I remember it being divisive at the time due to armor abilities mainly,Crizum,1
I remember Oathbreaker saying something about armour locks a long time ago,RonInDune,1
Armor lock was the bane of people’s existence,Crizum,1
oof,RonInDune,1
A lot of people use it to point towards some downward trajectory for Bungie in the pvp space,Crizum,1
Oh Reach was still Bungie? Thought it was 343,RonInDune,1
Reach was passed to 343 later on in its life cycle,Oathbreaker,1
I don’t think it’s fair to say that at all though,Crizum,1
Are there still people playing Reach on xbox today?,RonInDune,1
Or is it dead,RonInDune,1
They (Bungie) made some weird decisions about balancing back in the Reach era but it wasn't horrible.,Oathbreaker,1
The armor perks they added broke the mold they had built in Halo 2 &3,LW Mugetsu,1
And not in a good way,LW Mugetsu,1
"Mostly dead I would assume, you’ll probably still find a few people playing any game but most people went to 4 or more likely cod",Crizum,1
The people who went to 4 basically came back right away lol. 4 was COD with a Halo skin,Oathbreaker,1
Haha,Crizum,1
5 was pretty good but at that point I was deep in to Destiny and didn’t hold on to my Xbox for long,Crizum,1
"The general populace has moved on, Halo will never be what it was but I don’t think COD will be either? They’ll do big initial numbers but most people are on the battle royal train?",Crizum,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
If you enjoy the gunplay in Destiny you’ll likely enjoy what Reach has to offer,Crizum,1
Eh,Oathbreaker,1
I wouldn't directly say that,Oathbreaker,1
But they're close enough that things will be familiar,Oathbreaker,1
I love the Destiny gun feel more than anything else so I'm down with that,RonInDune,1
The DMR is just a proto scout rifle,Crizum,1
Weapon recoil is closer to destiny than the previous halo games,LW Mugetsu,1
I liked what they tried to do with Invasion,Crizum,1
I'm just excited for them to basically re-release the halos in chronological order on pc,Arixama,1
I've not played Halo since Halo 2 back on Windows Vista so yeah I'm super hyped,RonInDune,1
The remastered 2 multiplayer was fun for a bit,Crizum,1
I played the shit out of 5s multiplayrt,Arixama,1
"I really enjoyed 5, hopefully Infinite is great. But honestly it’ll probably be like every other game I buy lately where I play for a few hours and get back on Destiny",Crizum,1
"Yeah, If there's a new game I want to play, I pretty much get it at release, no life it until I finish the campaign, and then never touch it again until like dlcs *sometimes*",Arixama,1
Exactly lol,RonInDune,1
"I'm real excited for Star Wars  titanfall cause I'm not doing a lot in destiny right now, so it's the perfect weekend for it",Arixama,1
That game is apparently Sekiro with jedis,Crizum,1
"we got official merch! more will be added in the future as well!
https://twitter.com/TzarGG/status/1195060330835132416?s=19",thegoaliebear,1
I like the colours! Very unorthodox,RonInDune,1
Makes me think of SFV for some reason haha,Crizum,1
i wish i had the cash to drop on one of those haha...but I'll just wait for the mousepad and/or shirt.,thegoaliebear,1
@Buttkikker would you be wanting to try all three time trials or just one? Crota seems to be the hardest but I have a pretty good idea on how to deal with him,Crizum,1
"hell yeah, I like the look!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
as many as possible preferably,Buttkikker,1
"Okay cool, we can knock out as many as we can before you all raid",Crizum,1
will be more toward 6:45 for me to get on. still have to eat.,thegoaliebear,1
Hey @Buttkikker wanna do the dungeon while we wait?,Crizum,1
ye sure,Buttkikker,1
if you have room for one more can i hop in on the dungeon?,LW Mugetsu,1
Sure,Crizum,1
sweet,LW Mugetsu,1
Ok the Recluse nerf is pretty big I feel like,RonInDune,1
"And I""m curious to see how this affects One Eyed mask",RonInDune,1
They kept tracking and health regen but removed overshield,RonInDune,1
:o,Trissin,1
And Xenophage will get a slight buff but I'm wondering if that's enough,RonInDune,1
Petition to change the perk name on OEM to “Shitty devour”,Crizum,1
I'm yet to acquire that still,Trissin,1
Crizum basically dragged me to getting *Xenophage* last week so I've been using it a lot,RonInDune,1
"I love it in MOmentum control, thing has no range drop off and is perfectly hitscan",RonInDune,1
Lol I got to the boss and tried the encounter once,Trissin,1
and noped outta there,Trissin,1
Are the enemies 980?,Trissin,1
Enemies 970 boss 980,RonInDune,1
I see,Trissin,1
I'm not gonna try to solo it lol,Trissin,1
especially with the annoying match game mechanic,Trissin,1
At least it is t a darkness zone,Crizum,1
OEM still OP,Pentan,1
Wait what,Trissin,1
It is a darkness zone,Trissin,1
Isn't it in the tunnels?,Trissin,1
If you finish the totem encounter it's no longer a darkness zone,RonInDune,1
Ohhhhhhhh I see,Trissin,1
THat's how I tried soloing it,RonInDune,1
That probably makes it a little more manageable,Trissin,1
Lol,Trissin,1
OEM nerf ends in two ways,Crizum,1
"People still get killed by them and complain that it isn’t enough, or people get killed by them and still complain it’s OP",Crizum,1
!lfg search,RonInDune,1
i'm just chillin in raid chat whenever people start filling in.,thegoaliebear,1
One more survival match and I'll join you in the chat,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
99% progression lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
that one eyed mask nerf made me shed a tear of joy,Spitfire2266,1
i would have liked the wall hacks to die too but ill take what i can get,Spitfire2266,1
@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 we are just loaded into the raid no rush tho. hope you get the win.,thegoaliebear,1
let's finish that cp tomorrow evening. same time 8pm est. maybe the game will get its shit together by then lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
The game REALLY didn't want us to succeed.,LW Mugetsu,1
What happened?,Crizum,1
whawhat happened?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Glitches, lots and lots of glitches",RonInDune,1
ooooof,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
i bet they were bad too,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"like every single bug you've known to happen on one run or another, just happened attempt after attempt.",thegoaliebear,1
a crap ton of shielded goblins spawning during the damage phase,LW Mugetsu,1
uhhhhhhh,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yikes,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yeah. absolutely nothing that we could do but stand there and watch,LW Mugetsu,1
did it lag you guys out or was it just  that you couldnt do any damage?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
cuz of adds,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
They do spawn around that time so maybe a timing issue?,Crizum,1
maybe,LW Mugetsu,1
nah our timing was just fine.,thegoaliebear,1
but it happened multiple times,LW Mugetsu,1
i did get weasel'd once as well.,thegoaliebear,1
the game could have been lagging on us perhaps.,thegoaliebear,1
anyone down to do a raid marathon over the weekend?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
i got some quest i want to complete before next sport season starts,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
i'm not sure i'll have the time for a bunch of raids. i'm in GoS on sunday but i could probs do a couple raid saturday night.,thegoaliebear,1
Scourge! Scourge! Scourge!,RonInDune,1
"If I’m around sure, still wanna get those nightmare hunts done",Crizum,1
"lol, hope you get anarchy @RonInDune !!!",Trissin,1
Ron wait for the drop buff lol,Crizum,1
^,Buttkikker,1
do you have it @Buttkikker ?,Trissin,1
LOL,Buttkikker,1
no,Buttkikker,1
Honestly by Bungie's timescale the buff might happen next year,RonInDune,1
:(((,Trissin,1
Yeah that’s fair,Crizum,1
i hope you guys get it,Trissin,1
dont have any raid exotic,Buttkikker,1
it's honestly so much fun,Trissin,1
oh,Trissin,1
besides divinity,Buttkikker,1

Anarchy is literally the only exotic I'm missing. I,RonInDune,1
I'm 138/139,RonInDune,1
i need to get divinity,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"I need tarrabah, at 138 myself",Crizum,1
I wish I could my multiple Tarrabahs for one anarchy lol,RonInDune,1
20/132 baby,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

I think I'm cursed to never get Anarchy until @Thawxtem gets it,RonInDune,1
lol,LW Mugetsu,1
i'm in the same boat,LW Mugetsu,1
I should run crown and try to get tarrabah,Trissin,1

I’m kidding,Crizum,1
"we should take ya through spire @Crizum , its pretty fun",Trissin,1
"take me, take me",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
tbh im not a fan of any of the y1 raids but levi base is tolerable,Buttkikker,1
"Oh hey if we're doing spire I'm in, I love it",RonInDune,1
"I’d like to, I want to clear out the backlog for prestige leviathan so I can get a quest slot back",Crizum,1
I did the opening section solo trillions of times to try and get the sleeper catalyst,RonInDune,1
I reaaaaaly need the catalysts from y1 raids,Buttkikker,1
i have almost every other catalyst done,Buttkikker,1
thats actually crazy,Trissin,1
im still missing so many,Trissin,1
i really want wardcliff catalyst but it's yet to drop for me,Trissin,1
They drop pretty often with that clan perk,Crizum,1
yeah?? i haven't noticed it doing anything tbh....,Trissin,1
when did d2 come out 2016?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
or was it 2017?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"grinded the hell out of strikes with ari and matos during solstice, didn't see any catalyst drops",Trissin,1
"the only catalysts i need to do are: sleeper, telesto, acrius, mida, and i have rat king but need others to finish it",Buttkikker,1
lol we can trade rat kings @Buttkikker,Trissin,1
"I think 17, we’re in year 3 now",Crizum,1
w8ng for the sidearm meta,Buttkikker,1
"i know you've already completed, but I think some people used rat king for tunnel encounter in pit",Trissin,1
for the invis lol,Trissin,1
tho i did enjoy rat king in momentum control,Buttkikker,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
well if people are doing some raids this weekend lmk. down to help out. but I'll definitely need to wait until sunday to do another Garden run haha.,thegoaliebear,1
im 100% down to do all of the raids in the game,Buttkikker,1
yeah we have the beginnings of garden PTSD,RonInDune,1
i need something from all of them,Buttkikker,1
Only thing I need from Y1 is acrius catalyst. Somehow that's never dropped for me,Trissin,1
Wait that isn’t part of a quest? Why is it telling me to do prestige Levi?,Crizum,1
for the ornament,Buttkikker,1
and to get rid of the,Buttkikker,1
GODDAMN,Buttkikker,1
quest,Buttkikker,1
Oh. Well I guess that’s nice,Crizum,1
Better than most quests for the ornament,Crizum,1
remember when it was in the heavy weapon area,Buttkikker,1
“Give Tess money”,Crizum,1
i remember that @Buttkikker,Trissin,1
had to do it because it was literally taking a spot in your weapon inventory,Trissin,1
lol,Trissin,1
it was the best,Buttkikker,1

*The Sanctified Mind heard that*,Peronix,1
yeah now the game will be nothing but bugs and error codes lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
He's deleting our characters as we speak,Peronix,1

yup the knights are named after goats,RonInDune,1

The last pokemon game I finished the campaign on was x/y I believe,Arixama,1
i liked X/Y alot but sun/moon where meh,Buttkikker,1
"I pretty much play them for the campaign and that's it, so my experience may not be super useful 😂",Arixama,1

Bloody hell reading these comments is like reading some abstract quantum mechanics paper,RonInDune,1

"hahaha i just spoiled myself on Frozen 2. in conclusion, i will be crying next thursday night.",thegoaliebear,1
They gotta kill someone major so when they comeback in Froz3n it’s a big deal,Crizum,1
"they don't ""kill"" them. it's emo as hell tho.",thegoaliebear,1
lol didnt frozen 2 come out like 2 years ago?,SpoOoOoky!!!,1
all the reviews from the preview screenings have said that the mega fans will be happy with it. killing off a main character likely doesn't accomplish that.,thegoaliebear,1
not really up to date on my disney,SpoOoOoky!!!,1
no they had several shorts come out tho.,thegoaliebear,1
the actual sequel comes out next thursday.,thegoaliebear,1

"so my coach has always had something against me bc i was a walk-on and ended up winning our program's first ever league championship last season, and he can't get over that. he's actively trying to make it so I'm not the starting goalie this season, but this is just too hilarious to me:",thegoaliebear,1
"Holy cow, congrats! That's amazing!",RonInDune,1
literally our only two wins so far this season have been my shutouts. but he's so set on pushing me out of the starting spot he's more willing to let the tean lose than to just play me😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
That's kinda toxic,RonInDune,1
last year i used to get upset over this shit but now it's just hysterical to me.,thegoaliebear,1
How are some people so *petty*,Peronix,1
Hire a hitman,RonInDune,1
my entire team knows it too like they've literally asked me about it.,thegoaliebear,1
it's just so ridiculous.,thegoaliebear,1

||and xenophage buff???||,Chance,1

"@thegoaliebear my wife’s professor in grad school was exactly like that, petty af.  Wife almost gave up on her masters because of it.  Honestly, It’s because these type of people will abuse any sort of real or perceived power they have in order to feel superior to someone they feel threatened by.  Glad you don’t have to deal with that shit much longer.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
yeah that's exactly what it is. he never actually recruited me. my assistant coaches were the ones who really wanted me to come here. so he just never wanted to see me succeed lol.,thegoaliebear,1
jokes on him tho. i helped get him the only league title he's ever gotten in his 11 years here hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
that's honestly pretty psychotic imo,RonInDune,1
oh he absolutely should not be coaching young women lmao.,thegoaliebear,1

So Destiny didn't win anything at the Game of the Year awards,RonInDune,1
"Shame, but expected",RonInDune,1
"I got a new mic and it was working fine for one sentence, and now it won't activate",Peronix,1
honestly maybe try plugging it in again haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Here's the winners, if people are interested",RonInDune,1
@Peronix you’re such a good listener,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
That pc game of the year is fucking depressing,Crizum,1
Nothing came out that was better than a 10 year old release?,Crizum,1
"I've never played Warcraft, so I can't comment, but yeah some awkward choices out there",RonInDune,1
"Honestly I'd put Outer Wilds/Disco Elysium/Baba is you ahead, but these lists are inherently subjective",RonInDune,1
"some of my buddies are ALL about WoW classic, but that's a pretty niche audience. I agree, seems like a very odd game of the year",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Death Stranding maybe?,RonInDune,1
"Haha yeah, but it just came out so people won’t be able to vote for it",Crizum,1
"I deleted my statement cause it came off too dismissive of Days Gone and I haven’t played it to judge, just didn’t look all that great to me",Crizum,1
Death Stranding winning anything will cause mountains of salt though,Crizum,1
"It looked like open world version of The Last of Us, starring the cast of Sons of Anarchy",RonInDune,1
"Which is interesting, cause of a lot of goty awards just vote on whatever game appears to make them look the deepest",Crizum,1
I'm kinda sad Control didn't win more things though,RonInDune,1
"Still need to play that, I loved Alan wake and quantum break",Crizum,1
It's my clear GOTY and one of the best games I've ever played. I've been singing its praises here for a long time lol,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 skurrj is just eating so will be a little bit.,thegoaliebear,1
not too long tho.,thegoaliebear,1
really odd question about garden of salvation...could it be done with three 1st timers in 2 hours?,MrJ,1
is it mechanically hard like spire of stars or easier,MrJ,1
possibly yes.,thegoaliebear,1
Depends on how quick you are at learning,Crizum,1
"encounters are very easy but the boss is very involved and, like spire, requires everyone to be involved in the mechanics individually.",thegoaliebear,1
"The first three encounters should be easy enough assuming we have three people who have prior experience, can split the groups somewhat evenly",Crizum,1
Fourth one isn’t terrible but you gotta be quick on add clear,Crizum,1
@thegoaliebear i need maybe 10 minutes,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
that's fine.,thegoaliebear,1
"forgot there was an Overwatch tourney at 3pm on Sunday thought it was on Saturday its not mandatory that i make it, but it would be nice if i could....ill watch a lot of tutorials on it.",MrJ,1

Just noticed the new name lol,Trissin,1
I have my talents,Peronix,1
That discussion wasn't supposed to leave the raid,LW Mugetsu,1
LOL,Trissin,1
*sigh*,LW Mugetsu,1
At least he didn't change it to something involving an anime that was being talked about,LW Mugetsu,1
You can’t say that and not name the anime,Crizum,1
there are a few suspects on my mind already,Trissin,1
but I'm not sure I want to know,Trissin,1
Hi,Peronix,1
"It was "" That time I got reincarnated as a slime""",LW Mugetsu,1

Oh,Crizum,1
That’s mega tame I’m imagining way worse,Crizum,1
^^^,Trissin,1
It makes me laugh so I was playing it in the background while raiding,LW Mugetsu,1
"I have much more ""interesting"" anime that I could have been watching",LW Mugetsu,1
You can just say hentai,Peronix,1
We all have our weird ones,Trissin,1
LOL,Trissin,1
Azure Lane?,Crizum,1
I would say ecchi not quite hentai,LW Mugetsu,1
Azure lane is tame,LW Mugetsu,1
"alright unrelated to all this anime talk, anybody know of a way to split audio outputs?",Arixama,1
splitting it in media form or from a source?,Oathbreaker,1
"like have sound for one application going to like a monitor, and then sound for another app going to headset",Arixama,1
hmmm,Oathbreaker,1
not that I'm aware of,Oathbreaker,1
damn,Arixama,1
maybe an app of some kind exists for that express purpose?,Oathbreaker,1
"@Arixama if it's a headset with it's own drivers you can go into sound devices in windows, set your headset to default communication device, and set your monitor speakers as the default device.  I do this so only game sound/music come out of my speakers but discord audio is strictly over my headset.  Is this the type of setup you're wanting?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"No actually, I have that set up. Wanted to have game audio through headset and then the twitch app audio through speakers @Skurrj (Pork Steeple)",Arixama,1
brb raid team,Peronix,1
looks like there are definitely some 3rd party audio managers that will do precisely what you're wanting to do.  I found and read thru a bit of a guy's solution to your problem and it looks legit and he seems to know very much what he's talking about.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
https://johanbak.com/2018/09/05/take-control-of-your-twitch-stream-audio-a-setup-guide/,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
seems pretty damn involved and there's probably a better/more up to date solution.  Maybe try searching out some twitch/audio forums and find someone who's all about it.  When i was learning how to overclock i got a few mentors in forums and it's really nice to have knowledgeable friends who can help you with very specific issues you encounter.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1

I'm down for last wish,LW Mugetsu,1
yeah i can.,thegoaliebear,1

like 8 is good. if we can just make sure everyone else is pretty experienced with it i would prefer that bc that raid can take a while lol.,thegoaliebear,1

must have gone at least 20+ clears without getting 1KV.,thegoaliebear,1
If your recluse does not have over 70k enemies defeated you will be kicked,Trissin,1
hahaha. but for real it's just one of those raids that can easy drag on if one person doesn't get it lol. the 1KV chase absolutely ruined this raid for me so I'd prefer To...not spend more time in it than necessary💀😂,thegoaliebear,1
lol,Trissin,1

grenade launchers still wreck face I think,RonInDune,1

probably like 6/6:30 pm usually,Crizum,1

tomorrow I'm not available until like 9:15 EST. so I'm fine skipping out on a run if time doesn't work out can always do another one some time.,thegoaliebear,1

i don't understand this meme,RonInDune,1
Oh but Trissin will,Crizum,1
"So far from what I’m seeing it’s still very much a beta or even alpha product. Red Dead Redemption 2 for instance runs worse than the Xbox one x version, Destiny 2 does run at 60 FPS with some bad input lag when using mouse and keyboard, and it’s running at 1080 upscaled to 4K on pc medium settings",Crizum,1
"Honestly, streaming with destiny isn't awful if they do it right. There was a solid 3 months I was without an actual gaming pc that I used a service the connected my *at least* 7 year old laptop to a remote rig.",Arixama,1
My system only has a 1060 but even that runs at 60+ FPS on high/max,Crizum,1
I've played Assassin's Creed Odyssey during the trial last year and it felt really impressive,RonInDune,1
But FPSs are a different beast,RonInDune,1
The important part is actually having bandwidth settings so you can control your upload speed,Arixama,1
Plus looking at the list of prices it’s not good,Crizum,1
True true,RonInDune,1
Full price for tomb raider when it was like 5 bucks a little while back?,Crizum,1
Also Google is notorious for shutting down products randomly,RonInDune,1

"Since it streams whatever you already own, and works with Gamepass",Crizum,1

The Indie game field this year is incredible,RonInDune,1

Anything but smash could win and I’d be happy,Crizum,1
hard to choose between Gris/Disco Elysium/Untitled Goose Game/Slay the Spire for indie as well,RonInDune,1
I'm a straight ticket voter for Control so it's an easy choice lol,RonInDune,1
"Just finished death stranding last night, it was great",Crizum,1
I'll have to wait for a year till it comes to PC but I'm super hyped anyway,RonInDune,1
I’m only in chapter 5 of death stranding  it’s amazing,Spitfire2266,1
"It only gets better from that point, MGS had a habit of getting harder to understand the twists and turns but that wasn’t the case for me here",Crizum,1
Chapter 4 was insane,Spitfire2266,1
Can’t even discuss my favorite parts lol,Crizum,1
Control was amazing too,Spitfire2266,1
Sekiro is game of the year so far but death stranding has a great chance to take that spot,Spitfire2266,1
All of this makes me wish Shadowkeep was better,RonInDune,1
And Anthem sadly sank like the Titanic,RonInDune,1
"I’m enjoying shadowkeep, but constantly updated live service games have a harder time reaching the levels of games that have a tighter focus on story",Crizum,1
Apparently undying mind is meh,Spitfire2266,1
Feelsbad,Spitfire2266,1
They could sink tons of money in the story but what comes next,Crizum,1
"Forsaken was so good, everything since Black Armoury feels like a slow downward spiral",RonInDune,1
Atleast the raids and the lore is still good,RonInDune,1
"And yeah, when Ghost says “there are still undying minds out there, we have work to do”",Crizum,1
After the third kill?,Crizum,1
"okay fam i was here thinking this buzzing noise was like, super obvious and distracting lol. re-watching stream now it's not bad at all. i think it is coming from my mic and does seem to be when it's at very specific angles lol.",thegoaliebear,1
I'm sorry for making it sound worse than it is!,RonInDune,1
hahaha no worries. it's been a thing for a while and i don't think i can fix it ? it definitely only happens if maybe the mic is titled a certain way or something.,thegoaliebear,1
but as long as it's not...constant or obnoxious it's okay aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"i may just get a dedicated mic. i know the basic Yeti mics aren't too expensive. but this has been working just fine for the time being aha. i was just worried it was like, sounding really bad and distracting 😂",thegoaliebear,1
oh man what a let down. I was so hyped for the final assault. Now I just feel dumb.,CrizMobius,1
haha. i think it's fun melting bosses like we did.,thegoaliebear,1
i'm just happy to have a new title.,thegoaliebear,1
I already did that like 100 times already..,CrizMobius,1
The engine that Bungie uses must have severe limitation in what you can do with bosses..,CrizMobius,1
at least put some interesting modifier on the boss,CrizMobius,1
...just something please....,CrizMobius,1
to be fair tho...there are a lot of people who will never have Undying. in the grand scheme of the population only a small percentage actually will complete the title.,thegoaliebear,1
so they can make vex offensive super easy.,thegoaliebear,1
cuz most people SUCC,Buttkikker,1
I don't mind it being easy.... is just that boss itself was a let down,CrizMobius,1
I wanted something spicy,CrizMobius,1
we are not like them casuals😂,thegoaliebear,1
haha true,CrizMobius,1
but i agree. a different mechanic would have been nice.,thegoaliebear,1
i mean if you for example would have put any monster modifier from diablo 3 on the boss I would have been satisfied,CrizMobius,1
Imagin a boss that shoot lighting when you shoot it,CrizMobius,1
just reuse the lightning animation from the vex portals,CrizMobius,1
yeah. checked Braytech.org and based on the triumphs of tracked players only 1.81% could have the title since the collections badge is the lowest percentage aha. our clan is probably that 1.8%😂😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
"Yea, Randy's probably kept most of the playerbase from the title",Peronix,1
They are trying to find a middle ground between hardcore and mid core/casual,Crizum,1
So anyone who doesn't have undying = ban? thats what youre saying,CrizMobius,1
"Like the 980 nightfalls tend to have interesting modifiers added, the master hunts etc, and for all our raid clearing only a low percentage of players complete it",Crizum,1
Would have liked to see something aside from just taking a boss model from D1 and putting it in the vex offensive but I get it haha,Crizum,1
Clan membership requirements are now Gjallarhorn/Solo Crota/Petra's Run/Anarchy/1KV within 3 complettions,RonInDune,1
"@Crizum Yeah sure but even nightfalls and monster hunt have ""boring"" modifiers compared to other games",CrizMobius,1
"There *might* be more things down the line, but Season of the Undying really suffered being tagged alongside Shadowkeep",RonInDune,1
Yeah it probably get a lot poeple worried about season pass,CrizMobius,1
I blame the stadia,Crizum,1
guys its time to leave pc.... lets go stadia,CrizMobius,1
300 ms delay,CrizMobius,1
some of the videos I saw was just awful,CrizMobius,1
i think Undying does have a good balance between easy challenges you can just get done and more hardcore stuff. Randys just made it awful becauss it was so disproportionately balanced compared.,thegoaliebear,1
"like the raids, the master nightfall is something majority of players will never do.",thegoaliebear,1
They went independent while launching on steam while working on a stadia version while most of Bungie is probably on D3 and whatever the net ease thing is,Crizum,1
Atleast nothing is RNG,RonInDune,1
Oni remastered let's go,RonInDune,1
"@thegoaliebear I disagree about Randy, I feel like the quest actually made you better at using scout rifles. IF you include that as a reward then the quest is fine.",CrizMobius,1
"No it’s Destiny Legends, a gacha based card game with all the names you may have read on a grimoire card once",Crizum,1
"Master Rahool is the dealer, of course",Peronix,1
Actually they should bring back Myth and make Myth 3,RonInDune,1
That was such a good game,RonInDune,1
Destiny Battlegrounds Mobile,CrizMobius,1
"Or maybe Marathon, but I never played that cause literally noone in India owned a Mac lol",RonInDune,1
nah Randys was poorly balanced haha. we just don't care bc we play enough to get through it anyway.,thegoaliebear,1
sure,CrizMobius,1
Randy's will get the Mountaintop treatment two seasons down the line,RonInDune,1
but for majority of playerbase that and master nightfall are the intimidating factors.,thegoaliebear,1
oh for sure those objectives will get tuned down.,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't get why everything has to be so casual friendly. Look at classic wow, its hardcore as **** and people still play that",CrizMobius,1
because of new light mostly,Buttkikker,1
"The move from three seasons to four would indicate to me that we’ll be getting more bits of smaller content so there is always something coming up, instead of hard and grindy content meant to last",Crizum,1
Also nostalgia is why people play classic wow haha,Crizum,1
True,RonInDune,1
like crizum said they are definitely trying to find a balance. but I think they will always lean toward the more the hardcore player base. titles were never meant for casuals. but there's still enough triumphd they can get within the titles.,thegoaliebear,1
"Wish Randy was actually a character in the game though, he sounds absolutely hilarious",RonInDune,1
In lore wasn’t he on Redrix’s team in crucible and he shot at Shaxx?,Crizum,1
Exactly,RonInDune,1
he was basically Leroy Jenkins,RonInDune,1
He’s the canon blueberry,Crizum,1
IS redrix dead?,CrizMobius,1
No I don't think so. Redrix was chums with the Drifter,RonInDune,1
He lives apparently according to wiki,CrizMobius,1

I completely forgot about the collections requirement,Trissin,1

I had 0 glory and matched with a bunch of people with like NF and stuff,Trissin,1
Ahhh,RonInDune,1
not rank based,Buttkikker,1
and I was like wtf,Trissin,1
:(((,Trissin,1
that doesn't even make senseee,Trissin,1
but the quest is like revoker,Buttkikker,1
ohhhh what,Trissin,1
okay nice,Trissin,1
total glory,Buttkikker,1
that's kind of a relief,Trissin,1
so no worries,Buttkikker,1
yeah,Trissin,1
why is competitive sbmm and not ranked,Trissin,1
"that defeats the purpose of the rank, doesnt it?",Trissin,1
who knows,Buttkikker,1
like why have a rank if it doesn't inherently have to do with skill,Buttkikker,1
yeah.... another question for Bungie I guess,Trissin,1
"The reasoning they gave was that the ranks will reflect your skill as more matches are played, so if you are supposed to be at a higher rank you will gain more glory as you win and lose less when you get teamed up with potatoes",Crizum,1
"Oh yeah I remember, it's supposed to get you to your actual rank faster",RonInDune,1
It's not as if you weren't getting matched with NF legends last season either,Crizum,1
Feel like Bungo thinks @Trissin 's deserved position is 0 lol,RonInDune,1
"Naw, they believe Trissin deserves a high rank, but has not played enough matches to get there if you are matching with NF monsters",Crizum,1
Unless you are matching Bought Forgottens who migrated over from console?,Crizum,1
Maybe glory is circular and 0 is the closest number to 5500/Legend,RonInDune,1
I wouldn't put a rounding error past them at all lol,Crizum,1
Gandhi's nukes have taught me games don't deal well with boundary conditions,RonInDune,1
Halo at 4K/60 fps looks fairly gorgeous damn,RonInDune,1
Doesn't look like a 10 year old game,RonInDune,1
"And the requirements are absurdly low, needs a GTX 770 for 4K@60",RonInDune,1
@RonInDune KH3 was okay until the last 4-5 hours where it was amazing but yeah fire emblem was next level im mad it wasnt nominated,Spitfire2266,1
I think for some reason they only wanted one Switch game on the GOTY,RonInDune,1
Fire Emblem being there would honestly just split the votes for Smash,Crizum,1

@RonInDune if you join you'd be our 6th 👀,thegoaliebear,1
hmm...might get the new G Pro headset. looks fresh as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
Putting that Randy's money to good use👌,Peronix,1
hahaha yeah there's another headset that's pretty new from a sound lab company that looks really nice too.,thegoaliebear,1
https://www.amazon.com/PuroGamer-Gaming-Headset-Headphones-Noise-Canceling/dp/B07XLFDSVP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8,thegoaliebear,1
we love that.,thegoaliebear,1
I have 5 1/2 hours of watching student presentations coming up so I need something relaxing later,RonInDune,1
Btw think I figured out why the cyclops kept spawning,Crizum,1
"The angelic explodes when killed, and we’ve been killing it as soon as it showed up. Need to let it get away from the boss or it will blow up the crit spots",Crizum,1
love that lol.,thegoaliebear,1
That makes a lot of sense,Trissin,1
"Would explain why it’s always the left cyclops and only sometimes the right, explosion radius and all that",Crizum,1
Yeah,Trissin,1
"Also read how to do the 20+ vex killed by the platform, if you shoot their heads off they stop trying to sacrifice and just chase people, so you do that and build while they try to murder you",Crizum,1
oou I see lol,Trissin,1
first grad school acceptance fam!,thegoaliebear,1
Congrats!!!,Trissin,1
Holy cow congrats!,RonInDune,1
You'll do great!,RonInDune,1
thanks😊 i still have several more going in but this one was rolling so...earlier you get the app in earlier you get a decision haha.,thegoaliebear,1
Some of the Google Stadia options are ... interesting,RonInDune,1
I didn't know people still used AIM or ICQ,RonInDune,1
lmao,thegoaliebear,1
Does MSN messenger even exist anymore? I thought they rolled it in to skype?,Crizum,1
Yup it's dead,RonInDune,1
I think it rebranded as Xbox Live messenger?,RonInDune,1
but yeah it got shut down centuries ago,RonInDune,1
Does AIM still exists?,LW Mugetsu,1
I don't know,RonInDune,1
lemme check,RonInDune,1
Surprised there isn’t a spot for Google+ and MySpace,Crizum,1
I thought it died in the mid 2000's,LW Mugetsu,1
Looks like AIM got murdered when Verizon acquired Yahoo and AOL,RonInDune,1
"Also, do they ask for your ChristianMingle and FarmersOnly accounts too?",Crizum,1
"I loved AIM, feels bad",RonInDune,1
lol,RonInDune,1
Do people legit use those or are they just for memes,RonInDune,1
Didn't ICQ die as well?,LW Mugetsu,1
ICQ was almost killed by AOL but I think it's mostly a Russian thing now,RonInDune,1
I know artists from Russian and other CIS countries often post their ICQ number alongside twitter/fb/insta,RonInDune,1
"But I didn't think people in the West still used, considering it's somewhat of a security risk",RonInDune,1
Ooh can't wait:,RonInDune,1
The real life eververse,Crizum,1
Honestly the books are so good they've got me hook line and sinker,RonInDune,1
Maybe we'll finally get the most important backstory of all - how the heck did Taeko-3 get a team of 9 Guardians killed in a easy ass strike,RonInDune,1
Read a theory that the reason we succeed so much is that our guardians are paracausal,Crizum,1
I think that they didn't have those void crystals to disrupt whatever was going on,Trissin,1
"So they are just bad, a lot of guardians are",Crizum,1
because they died and became those crystals right,Trissin,1
LOL,Trissin,1
that is another explanation,Trissin,1
just punch the wizards how hard can it possibly be,RonInDune,1
so the way I've thought of it is they went in and the shrieker was just immune,Trissin,1
"Plus yeah, we wouldn’t have beat VoG if Kabr didn’t get stuck",Crizum,1
^,Trissin,1
A lot of our success is built on the failures of others,Crizum,1
"That's true, we're just the tip of the spear",RonInDune,1
I think the only thing we didn’t need help of some sort was siva?,Crizum,1
"a bunch of mad, dancing guardians killing off Gods and teabagging them",RonInDune,1
"VoG we had the relic, Crota we had the knowledge of Eris etc,l",Crizum,1
Except we had help in the form of the big flaming axe against the siva vault,Arixama,1
"Yeah actually, none of our success, as impressive as they are in lore, are 100% ours",Crizum,1
Maybe crown of sorrows and scourge?,Crizum,1
and in Last Wish we were all being manipulated by two spooky queens from beyond the grave,RonInDune,1
The Leviathan raids are basically a self contained deal,RonInDune,1
That and we had the entire great hunt to draw knowledge from,Crizum,1
Yeah Shaxx has an Ahamkara skull hanging over his head lol,RonInDune,1
"The ahamkara whispers to Shaxx, Shaxx just yells louder in response",Crizum,1
loool,RonInDune,1
"Or is the crucible a granted wish? For Shaxx, he is always yelling fight forever",Crizum,1
Hmm maybe. Spinfoil time,RonInDune,1
"Always wondered why Eris never helped us out with Riven, she knows how dangerous an Ahamkara can be more than most",RonInDune,1
Maybe the VA was busy,RonInDune,1
Considering her rock is an ahamkara bone? Also she was busy at the time,Crizum,1
That also raises the question why there are no Taken on the moon,RonInDune,1
Maybe cause they belong to Savathûn now and she's manipulating the remains of Crota's brood in a different way,RonInDune,1
"Feels like Savathun wouldn’t take unless there is a reason for it, it wouldn’t be a tribute to her if she just overrode wills right?",Crizum,1
"Yeah Riven basically took over the remaining Taken and started granting wishes to Savathûn, so she's not getting direct tribute form them",RonInDune,1
"Which is another great lore entry by the way, when poor Illyn falls into Riven's trap",RonInDune,1
I love the writing in this ||https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/illyn|| entire lore book,RonInDune,1
Let’s just get this over with so we can have Destiny 3 launch with 100+ player zone events in a battle against Xivu Arath already,Crizum,1
Or do we beat Xivu with peace?,Crizum,1
She is basically the Goddess of War,RonInDune,1
How was the Goddess of War defeated in mythology?,RonInDune,1
"I mean, Kratos killed them all",Crizum,1
"In Greek mythology, I know Enyo was the Goddess of War, but I don't think she was ever defeated.",Peronix,1
Interesting I hadn't heard of ~~Enya~~ Enyo,RonInDune,1
I have definitely heard of Enya lol,RonInDune,1
I used to read a lot of mythology but my memory is terrible so I may have misspelled lol,Peronix,1
That makes me wish for a new Age of Mythology game,RonInDune,1
"Just looked it up, Enyo was indeed a goddess of war, called the sister of war ""in a role closely resembling Eris, the embodiment of strife and discord""",Crizum,1
I grew up with Indian myths obviously but there are so many gods and goddesses that you can tell basically any story regarding them and it'd probably turn out to be true,RonInDune,1
Oooooooh,RonInDune,1
Homer represented them as the same goddess,Crizum,1
a *l i n k*,Peronix,1
you may have found something **interesting**,RonInDune,1
time to post to raidsecrets and destinylore,RonInDune,1
get Byf on Line 1 stat,RonInDune,1
"""During the fall of Troy, Enyo inflicted terror and bloodshed in the war, along with Eris (Strife), Phobos (Fear), and Deimos (Dread)""",Crizum,1
Bungie is going to get smited by the Greek gods if they rip off too much of their story,RonInDune,1
"Oh I knew of Phobos and Deimos, that how Mars' moons are named",RonInDune,1
"Hey Ron, we met the Taken on Phobos, shortly after we met Eris, and Deimos being dread we ended it on the Dreadnaught",Crizum,1
dang,RonInDune,1
*lore intensifies*,Peronix,1
"Just for fun, here's a photo of Phobos that I processed:",RonInDune,1
Taken by the Indian Mars Orbiter Mission,RonInDune,1
"It may mean nothing but hey I also found this Ron, in the battle between Zeus and Typhon ( a god vs a monster) Enyo didn't take sides",Crizum,1
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm,RonInDune,1
hmmmm,RonInDune,1
hm,RonInDune,1
"So Xivu Arath may be playing both sides, is what you're saying?",Peronix,1
"""Eris (Strife) was Typhon's escort in the mellee, Nike (Victory) led Zeus into battle, impartial Enyo held equal balance between the two sides.""",Crizum,1
"idk, it's fun to have theories",Crizum,1
"After Niobe Labs, no theory is too far fetched",RonInDune,1
"Like, are we the Typhon if Bungie pulls from greek myths? We're not a god like Savathun, but we have been called monsters before?",Crizum,1
I would think God v Monster would be Traveller vs doom dorito,RonInDune,1
"Or are we Nike, leading the Travler to victory against the Darkness",Crizum,1
Or we actually start splitting into factions and represent both Nike and eris,Arixama,1
Who does that make the drifter,Crizum,1
Adidas,Peronix,1
Just a bunch of dredgens and reckoners doing slav squats,Crizum,1
:mind_blown:,Buttkikker,1
Also gunsmith is selling sniper rifle ammo finder if you don't already have it,Crizum,1
Will it give heavy or special?,RonInDune,1
yes,Buttkikker,1
/r/inclusiveor,RonInDune,1
"Should work for both, grenade launcher finder does. Also if you combine finder with scavenger you get a decent amount",Crizum,1
So I was trying to follow the original process for solving Niobe Labs to see if I could get it on my own,RonInDune,1
Till I came across this:,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, no",RonInDune,1
woooooow,Buttkikker,1
Also it needs you to read music and I never learned to do that,RonInDune,1
Wtf is THAT madness and who was on the combined CIA & FBI task force that deciphered that shit?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Looool,Trissin,1
Warlocks figuring that shit out:,Crizum,1
"Me, a Titan, wondering if I punch it or?",Crizum,1
"Lol! You know, with all the similar memes circulating, I no longer feel I meet the Warlock requirements.  Can I re-roll?",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Ah, I forgot, the first step to enlightenment is admitting you know nothing.  Ty Ghost Bot, my hope is restored.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Anyone want to run shattered throne? I need to do it for Wish-Ender/Izanagi, and I can't post in the LFG server for some reason",Templar26,1
i think the warmind bot might be having issues rn.,thegoaliebear,1
This is the solution to the musical symbols thing btw,RonInDune,1
might go to the mall today if i do i'm gonna pick up the Pro X headset👀🔥,thegoaliebear,1
they announce anything for the next season yet?,Matos,1
"No, may get a roadmap either today or next Thursday",Crizum,1
"Apparently there’s almost nobody playing the stadia version of Destiny, if you group up with two others the game just puts you in empty instances of survival? Literally free fabled",Crizum,1
lmaooo,thegoaliebear,1
I think you mean free legend,Arixama,1
Ohhh man,Crizum,1
Cross save for Unbroken,Crizum,1
!pop stadia,RonInDune,1
Lol 44 people played crucible yesterday on stadia,RonInDune,1
I want to know which brave souls did a raid though,RonInDune,1
!pop steam,Crizum,1
Holy shit,Crizum,1
Not bad,RonInDune,1
!pop Xbox,Crizum,1
Ooof,RonInDune,1
Truly the neglected child,RonInDune,1
Xbox looked at as the red headed stepchild still doing about 34x better,Crizum,1
!pvp ps4,Infernosi,1
oops,Infernosi,1
!pop ps4,Infernosi,1
Cross save really shifted the population,Crizum,1
And new light certainly made a mark,Infernosi,1
For sure,Crizum,1
Are there any graphs to show how the population rose and shifted over time?,Infernosi,1
So console+stadia is about 819k,Crizum,1
Looks like Xbox lost this particular console war,RonInDune,1
new light was definitely a big factor. there's new players every day because of it which is good.,thegoaliebear,1
Some of the new light players absolutely wreck face in the crucible though,RonInDune,1
"2,189,000 players yesterday? That math check?",Crizum,1
Seems like it,RonInDune,1
How does that compare to other big franchises?,RonInDune,1
For a live service game? Idk,Crizum,1
Check steamcharts?,Infernosi,1
I know for AAA games period it’s a good number but not massive,Crizum,1
"But that assumes sales and not players, for daily log-ins that seems good?",Crizum,1
It's 4th on steam,Infernosi,1
yeah the daily population is very healthy for an ongoing game.,thegoaliebear,1
Obviously not good for stadia in general since it was free for anyone who bought it and it launched yesterday,Crizum,1
Meaning even people who just wanted to check how it runs are counted,Crizum,1
"I’m not amazing at percentages, but how does that break down?",Crizum,1
"i think stadia will do better with more on-the-go games. not sure exactly what kind of games that encompasses tho haha. but as far as these massive AAA games go, i don't see Stadia ever becoming a main platform.",thegoaliebear,1
It seems like it would be something to use if you want to do something on the smaller end without access to your main platform of choice,Infernosi,1
yeah exactly.,thegoaliebear,1
Performance is failing in that regard though,Infernosi,1
mhmm. and with cross save its like...i already have a PlayStation. i can easily bring that somewhere and play D2 if I wanted.,thegoaliebear,1
"They oversold and under delivered, which is normal but I kinda feel like you can’t do that in the age of twitter anymore haha",Crizum,1
You can’t make pie in the sky statements of possibilities when the peanut gallery is getting ready to drag you,Crizum,1
i feel like it's a pretty unnecessary thing for a lot of people too tbh. aside from real gaming enthusiasts who have to have all the newest stuff...it really is a whatever kind of thing for vast majority of the market.,thegoaliebear,1
"Where it is currently, it's more like in Alpha",Infernosi,1
especially with the number of people already planning to get their new console next holiday haha.,thegoaliebear,1
They could try to market it to people who don't have a console. Try out all these things you've been missing without as big of an upfront cost,Infernosi,1
for sure.,thegoaliebear,1
"That’s the market, they want people who don’t want to invest in the latest tech, they aren’t after the pc crowd because the pc crowd will pay premiums for stuff that gives marginal gains, they want the lapsed gamers who don’t want to upgrade every few years",Crizum,1
oh damn best buy has the G935 headset on sale for 99.99,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm probably never going to play this, but the Half Life: Alyx trailer has got me super hyped",RonInDune,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2W0N3uKXmo,RonInDune,1
Wish Destiny worked in VR,RonInDune,1
"Oh shiiit, I may have to buy a headset now.  I love half-life (doom, resident evil, and silent hill too!) and that looks like  it’s going to be too good to pass up.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"I didn't quite like the first Half Life, felt the mechanics and gunplay was way worse than Quake or Delta Force, but HL2 is legit one of my fave games of all time",RonInDune,1
"Agreed, Quake always had one hell of an engine tho and HL 2 definitely felt like a different game entirely.  I remember thinking “holy crap, is this really half life? But it’s so smooth...”",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I think RE4 will always be my fave in the horror genre though.  I played that game to absolute death and then did it again on Wi because you got to actually aim a pistol at targets on screen.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Can still hear Ashley yelling “Leon!” as her dumbass just crouched down and refused to run away.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
shit i just had a heart attack i just got the Pro X headset and the mic wasn't picking up anything. turns out you need to install the Logitech G Hub app to sync everything.,thegoaliebear,1
damn...was about to be real emo hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
!pop stadia,Gimmie2,1
Anybody feel like trying a master hunt time trial or two?,Crizum,1
"Hunters too OP, pls nerf",RonInDune,1
Hahahahaha haha,Crizum,1
"“One hit titans are such bullshit, this is fair though”",Crizum,1
can't wait for the Destiny cookbook too,RonInDune,1
I actually quite like the top tree warlock overhaul,RonInDune,1
A mobility focused Warlock class is always appreciated,RonInDune,1
C O O K B O O K,Peronix,1
Is anyone else bothered by how off center the title on the cookbook looks?,RonInDune,1
The Destiny logo is not part of the text so i'm not sure why they used it to center the text,RonInDune,1
"As long as I can make a cake shaped like Shaxx's face, I'm fine",Peronix,1
What's the issue with a skillshot 1hko?,Oathbreaker,1
There’s no issue and I don’t see the difference as they both have a wind up of some sort. I’m just remarking on this somehow being different,Crizum,1
Ah no I love it,RonInDune,1
It's been too long,RonInDune,1
"Ah, misunderstood the tone of the messages then",Oathbreaker,1
Apologies,Oathbreaker,1
No worries I don’t always come off right in text,Crizum,1
I just find it kinda funny and think that now with Hunter having a windup one hit melee that refreshes on precision kills we’ll hopefully hear less about shoulder charge being bs,Crizum,1
"All the subclass changes seem pretty nice though, Warlock needed the love",Crizum,1
"Now every class gets their own ohk, and ways to get them back.",Infernosi,1
The warlock top tree really needs the grenade regen back though,RonInDune,1
That was very handy,RonInDune,1
especially combined with sunbracers,RonInDune,1
Interested in seeing how much bonus damage you get to golden gun with Knock ‘em Down,Crizum,1
Probably won’t match Nighthawk but if it’s enough of a buff to full time stompees I’d do it,Crizum,1
fam...the mic quality on this headset😩🙌,thegoaliebear,1
NO SPOILERS BUT FAM IT WAS SO GOOD.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm glad you liked it,RonInDune,1
okay we got our one wish tho:,thegoaliebear,1
Elsa gay.,thegoaliebear,1
Aw man so that *was* her coming out song,RonInDune,1
hell yeah!,thegoaliebear,1
like...it is *very heavily* coded haha.,thegoaliebear,1
That's great! So many show queerbait these days that I've gotten a wee bit jaded,RonInDune,1
yeah like the interactions when you see it...its very much the same way written like m/f couples are,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg search,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Xûr's selling OEM again,RonInDune,1
git it,RonInDune,1
_shhh_,Trissin,1
Where is that shady mofo?,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Noone knows I think, servers are down",RonInDune,1
This survey of Destiny players (albeit with a small sample size) is interesting,RonInDune,1
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1akVhVJu93Tv74coTvrhCAUeHCrlJ2UAcln2NW9k0ijQ/edit#gid=1752846963,RonInDune,1
I didn' realize the age of players skewed so low!,RonInDune,1
"Oh wow, that is pretty interesting",Trissin,1
"There's a trendline in one of the sheets but I wouldn't read too much into it, R-squared is like 0.07 lol",RonInDune,1
Oh no... I’m the weird older guy at the early 20-something party 😔 I thought there were more players around my age.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I feel ancient at 29 lol,RonInDune,1
"Ouch, I’ve got almost a decade on you",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
I’m officially dust now lol,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
https://tenor.com/view/old-man-grandpa-old-people-gif-13278004,RonInDune,1
Wait does that make you gen x or millenial,RonInDune,1
I was born in 82 so I’m right there at the cusp.  I think someone called it xillenial on Reddit.,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
'xillenial' sounds like a sleeping pill,RonInDune,1
Surely there's a cooler name,RonInDune,1
It would be appropriate lol,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Help make me cool again Obi-Ron, you’re my only hope",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
1982 was when the greatest album in history dropped - Thriller,RonInDune,1
So that's a good a name as any,RonInDune,1
"Not bad, not bad!",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Are you gen-x or millennial? Neither, I’m a Thriller.",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Makes me want to dance,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
is xur srsly selling OEM,Chance,1
good thing im not playing rn lmao,Chance,1
Servers have gone from a tapir to a weasel.,Peronix,1
I feel like this is a downgrade in terms of the circle of life,Peronix,1
Hunters really trying to hammer the servers so people can’t buy OEM huh,Crizum,1
We as a community are being punished for using recluse too much,RonInDune,1
lol,Trissin,1
It’s also getting close to American thanksgiving and prime ddos season,Crizum,1
huh,RonInDune,1
Brings me back to the days of Christmas of the year Destiny released,Peronix,1
I didn't know that was part of the Thanksgiving custom,RonInDune,1
"kinda what i was wondering, Peronix said Epic was acting stupid earlier too",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Weekends after thanksgiving and Christmas tend to be ddos’d and it’s more noticeable with more people logging on after getting new consoles/games etc,Crizum,1
@Peronix lol i see you have appropriately changed your name,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Can't. Stop. Vandalizing.,Peronix,1
Today's been a bad day for the internet,RonInDune,1
Another Canadian node issue?,Crizum,1
Clearly cyber-truck was *too* powerful for the Internet to handle,Peronix,1
woof,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"of course, made it all the way to Xur and, purchased the warlock helm and up pops the red banner of doom... can't get back in now.. guess i'll keep waiting and pretend i'm being productive elsewhere",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Cybertruck is too gorgeous for our ugly world,RonInDune,1
I unironically dig it. Slap a coat of black paint on it👌,Peronix,1
Yeah a matte black paint job will make it ridiculously cool,RonInDune,1
I absolutely love it,RonInDune,1
Found the problem; everyone hit ctrl+Z until it's working again,Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
nothing happened...,WhereisRegashi,1
"Must’ve been someone else then, so we’ve confirmed 2 internet users are not the problem.  Still waiting on word from the remaining 4.4 billion",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Is it still not up?,RonInDune,1
This is way worse than most outages it feels like,RonInDune,1
"I keep searching articles to see if it is part of a large scale attack (certainly looks that way), but have yet to find anything.  I haven’t tried to get back on for a couple hours now, but I imagine servers are still down/unplayable",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Maybe it's Lizard Squad again,RonInDune,1
"Honestly kiddie DDOS tools are dime a dozen, anyone with a sufficient grudge can do a lot of damage",RonInDune,1

I picked up Norman reedus and the fucked up fetus today,Arixama,1
My favorite musical,Peronix,1
I too love the Crown of Sorrows raid,RonInDune,1
"After seeing some gameplay and stuff I decided to give it a go, and if I don't like it I can trade it in",Arixama,1
Have you played it yet? Can you *be* the fetus?,Peronix,1
*Can I date Mads Mikkelsen?*,Peronix,1
See that would win GOTY easily,RonInDune,1
Kojima was going through some stuff in that game haha,Crizum,1
Is he ever not?,Peronix,1
like a monster energy addiction...,Buttkikker,1
"Okay yes, all you drink in that game is monster energy and beer",Crizum,1
Gotta piss red white and blue to reconnect America,Crizum,1
lol,Buttkikker,1
So if it takes kidney disease to do so,Crizum,1
Just sounds like my friend's frat,Peronix,1
Destiny is back and running,LW Mugetsu,1
You say that now...,Peronix,1
I'm playing,LW Mugetsu,1
It's says the clan servers are unavailable,LW Mugetsu,1
"I just read there may be a queue, so maybe test servers or a gradual restoration in goin down.  Bodes well for the raid",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Yeah I was actually thinking of rescheduling for a later date considering the server issues,Crizum,1

@Arixama I am omnipresent,Peronix,1
Doesn't this Halo reach Season progression look very similar to what we have in Destiny right now?,RonInDune,1
looks like a general season pass yeah,Crizum,1
Did Reach have anything like this originally?,RonInDune,1
"Not that I can remember, I mean you could unlock different bits of armor to customize even in Halo 3, but it was usually tied to rank/doing certain things in game",Crizum,1
Interesting,RonInDune,1
Honestly the entire UX for Reach seems to be very similar to Destiny so far,RonInDune,1
Yeah looking again it Reach they started costing credits you'd earn through gameplay,Crizum,1
So Reach had MTX?,RonInDune,1
"Naw, they were earned in game",Crizum,1
tied to rank,Crizum,1
Ohh that's good,RonInDune,1
So the better you did the faster you'd earn them,Crizum,1

EVA[C] should look slightly familiar to you,Crizum,1
Oof this looks very intimidating,RonInDune,1
"Halo 5 didn't have seasons, but it did have micro transactions so this isn't really a surprise",Arixama,1
Is Halo 5 even coming to PC?,RonInDune,1
I don't see the announcement,RonInDune,1
likely not. 5 is not part of the MCC.,Oathbreaker,1
Feel like it'll be a dead game once the MCC is out,RonInDune,1
"oh man, I do wish my friends didn't all abandon Halo 5 cause I had a lot of fun with that PvPvE mode",Crizum,1
What was that mode like?,RonInDune,1
Gambit-ish?,RonInDune,1
"5 probably will get ported to pc in some capacity, but they're probably focused on mcc right now",Arixama,1
5 is technically on PC already.,Oathbreaker,1
Custom Games/Forge only but it is on PC.,Oathbreaker,1
Woah,RonInDune,1
"lot of issues for it though, mouse input stuff among other bugs",Oathbreaker,1
Infinite is launching late next year so 343 will have their hands full,RonInDune,1
I honestly cant imagine them putting everything but 5 on pc.,Arixama,1
Ron https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3My_2vZQjBI,Crizum,1
Wait that trailer doesn't explain it at all haha,Crizum,1
Also that trailer is very frenetic,RonInDune,1
What was that infection mode?,RonInDune,1
about a minute in it starts,Crizum,1
"Infection started as a custom online gametype, iirc started mainly as swords vs shotguns. Sword team started with one player",Crizum,1
"that's Firefight Crizum, Warzone was separate",Oathbreaker,1
"But faster movement, when they killed a shotgun player they swapped to sword team",Crizum,1
oh damn that sounds like a great mode,RonInDune,1
"and yeah I'm trying to find a video that isn't ""MOST  INSANE WARZONE MATCH 98 KILLS"" and got the wrong thing",Crizum,1
ah my bad,Oathbreaker,1
And was there a football mode of some kind?,RonInDune,1
I'm not signed in my pc so hopefully this one works,Crizum,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=av-N5smXFpw,Crizum,1
"yeah, Grifball which has been around since like.... Halo 3?",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
Yeah Warzone looks amazing,RonInDune,1
Is that part of Halo 5 forge on PC?,RonInDune,1
no,Oathbreaker,1
Honestly all the multiplayer stuff for Halo 5 looks so good,RonInDune,1
awww,RonInDune,1
Halo has had tons of customizable gametypes,Crizum,1
you could technically force load the maps for a while but I think it got patched out,Oathbreaker,1
Infection became an actual gametype in 4 or 5,Crizum,1
Infection was a gametype back in 3,Oathbreaker,1
Does the gunplay still feel simlar to Destiny?,RonInDune,1
It started in Halo 2,Oathbreaker,1
"Well, moreso I mean with the flood and stuff",Crizum,1
Like will my noob D2 curcible skills carry over,RonInDune,1
not just a supported player gametype? idk words haha,Crizum,1
The only time Flood models were involved was H4,Oathbreaker,1
It's been matchmade since Halo 3,Oathbreaker,1
Was it a rotator?,Crizum,1
"Was in the social playlists IIRC, definitely was in Reach for matchmaking",Oathbreaker,1
I don't really remember about 3 and if it was just a rotator or not,Oathbreaker,1
In Reach it was fixed,Oathbreaker,1
I miss assault,Crizum,1
Fixed as in always present,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, they had a lot of those goofier gametypes as rotated playlists, like at one point Team Fiesta was a thing?",Crizum,1
Also if you thought Crucible was sweats,Crizum,1

"Huh that sounds reasonable, but it shouldn't take down *all* platforms, should it?",RonInDune,1
Hahaha but at least while scrolling through the replies on twitter we got this gem,Crizum,1
Bungie reporting that all services are back online now (as of 10m ago),Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
"Well, D2 services; D1 is still down",Skurrj (Pork Steeple),1
Apparently Bungie is 5th on the list of developers with all time high metcritic scores,RonInDune,1
Pretty cool,RonInDune,1
Which games are this based of? its the only the Halo games + Destiny right?,CrizMobius,1
And Myth/Oni/Marathon as well,RonInDune,1
oh really was those games good as well?,CrizMobius,1
Oni was *amazing*!,RonInDune,1
"I've never played anything quite like that one, except perhaps Remember Me",RonInDune,1
And Marathon pioneered quite a bit of modern FPS standards,RonInDune,1
And Myth 2 was actually a fairly interesting RTS,RonInDune,1
Yeah remember playing myth II for a bit,CrizMobius,1
A few of those studios don’t have very many titles haha,Crizum,1

I've heard of 3 man but not two,Trissin,1

I'm down,Yeti,1
Would you mind if we took 2 guardians on their first run or do you wanna speed run this?,Yeti,1
I'm fine with whatever. as long as everyone else in the run has done it before.,thegoaliebear,1
I can run if there is an open spot,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
If they don't run do you want to go for another subclass triumph? I think I just need solar,Yeti,1
i only need arc but I'm down doing an all solar run again.,thegoaliebear,1

"I’d be down yeah, also thinking of making a run or two for Wednesday, maybe knock out a triumph or two",Crizum,1
okay. i don't think i'll be available at all wednesday-saturday since i'm going home for thanksgiving. and i don't feel like setting up my PC and moving it around only for a few days lol.,thegoaliebear,1

What weapons would you guys recommend for cold fusion medals? I'm trying to farm out the rest of mine.,Nahkriin,1
I used a fast firing fusion: Zealot's Reward for mine,RonInDune,1
Jotunn and Erentil are also good options,RonInDune,1
High Impact fusions are your best best.,Oathbreaker,1
"Ok, thank you.",Nahkriin,1
I got mine with loaded question and tempered dynamo,Yeti,1
but a high impact or adaptive with back up plan will get it done,Yeti,1
I like how you can place first 5 times in a row and still lose games in survival,CrizMobius,1
Is it true that having lots of incomplete catalysts decrease catalyst drop rates?,RonInDune,1

Is that true???? That might explain a lot",Trissin,1

Unless warlock/hunter have something like the feedback fence?,Crizum,1
It's hunter or titan I thought?,RonInDune,1

Garden of Mediocre Loot,rozak,1
if only cross play existed.,thegoaliebear,1
Playing against Stadia players in the Crucible😩👌,Peronix,1
"Steam autumn sale is up, and the pixel art wallpaper they have on is so good",RonInDune,1
">>> Challenge: Once you first bank, you have 10 seconds to fully fill the bank. Send 1 in, do a full clear, then 2 in the same side, pick up extra motes, get 10 each. Pull, and all 3 people bank 10 motes one after another.",RonInDune,1
"Honestly, sending two teams of two is going to be *way* more consistent",Arixama,1
Yeah that's what I was thinking,RonInDune,1
I believe that shielded goblins don't spawn until you bank the first time?,Arixama,1
"Yup, if noone's enlightened they are not supposed to spawn",RonInDune,1
this breaks on second damage phase,RonInDune,1
And team one should have buff when they come back from the second side,Arixama,1
at first I thought this was for 3rd encounter and I thought this was gonna be hella difficult,Trissin,1
So basically take the encounter slow? Do the shielded goblins stop spawning if the people enlightened run off their buff?,Crizum,1
"No, they continue to spawn",Trissin,1
But they don't start spawning until someone deposits,Trissin,1
"So thtis shouldn't be too difficult, I'm down to try it ASAP",RonInDune,1
"Got it, so it seems like they do three in each portal so that all six people go in",Crizum,1
Three in blue get to babysit while the three rotate in red,Crizum,1
"Or, I guess, the teams tag out, so whoever stays the first time swaps with one of the teams",Crizum,1
Does it spawn more enemies if more people go in?,Arixama,1
"Naw, but if you are quick enough and clear everything the prior team will leave notes behind if they don’t grab them all",Crizum,1
So by grabbing 10 and still clearing those motes will be there if you are quick enough along with a new set of enemies,Crizum,1
Then why send 3 people? Send the two teams of 2.,Arixama,1
"One person gets 10, leaves motes on the floor, the next time two go in, they get the motes for them and whatever else was left, which should total 30, when they get back and bank the other three people repeat that on the opposite side",Crizum,1
There's no guarantee you'll spawn on the side with motes though. Sending 2 and picking up all the motes is going to be way more consistent,Arixama,1
Do we know if 10 has to be banked or just a total of 30?,Crizum,1
It’s the same side? You just spawn on opposite ends so yeah you’d have to run,Crizum,1
"If it has to be 10 each time, then that makes sense, but there's no reason to risk stupid deaths if it doesn't have to be 10",Arixama,1
The only hang up I can see is maybe the time it takes for 4 people to deposit puts them outside of the challenge time limit?,Crizum,1
"So folks what's the best black shader? If I want to go the Men In Black look on my lock, what's some good shaders?",RonInDune,1
Superblack,Trissin,1
oh wait,Trissin,1
"Yeah no pure black shaders, you could try Fright Night, Skele-Ghaul, Bloody Tooth, or Amethyst Veil, but those will all have undertones of other colors",Crizum,1
Yeah that's what was happening,RonInDune,1
I'll try Skele Ghaul though don't remember that,RonInDune,1
I like how Shadowstrike looks nothing like the preview would have you believe,Crizum,1
oof,RonInDune,1

No,Oathbreaker,1
"140s as an archetype, sure",Oathbreaker,1
"but 90s and 72s, hell no",Oathbreaker,1
merge 140s into 90 rpm snipes and nix the 140 archetype,Oathbreaker,1

Interesting discussion about Ada-1:,RonInDune,1
"I always thought that Bungie should make more of the fact that Ada-1 is perhaps the oldest being in the tower, she was literally created as the collapse was happening",RonInDune,1
"Ooh wow, that's interesting",Trissin,1
I never really noticed she was so different from other exos,Trissin,1
"She seems really fragile too, looks like she was made of porcelain.",RonInDune,1
Compare that with combat Exos like Cayde or Banshee,RonInDune,1
and how rugged they look,RonInDune,1
I can't get a good shot of the Exo stranger from D1 but I assume she was a combat exo too,RonInDune,1
The exos were created before the collapse. Cayde and Elsie bray(the exo stranger) were exos before the collapse.,LW Mugetsu,1
"THey've all been reset multiple times since then, except for Lakshmi and Ada",RonInDune,1
We don't know if the exo stranger has been reset.,LW Mugetsu,1
That's true,RonInDune,1
THey really should spend one of these seasons/expansions going into more depth on the Exos and the Deepstone Crypt,RonInDune,1
Such a fascinating concept,RonInDune,1
We only found her identity through some of her journals. I wish they would go deeper into her backstory.,LW Mugetsu,1
She was a cool character! Wasn't there hints that our intereactions with her were chronologically backwards from her perspective?,RonInDune,1
She was a bray who decided to cooperate with the ishtar collective so she had access to their vex research. So it's very possible it's backwards.,LW Mugetsu,1
Oh man there's so much possibility in Destiny,RonInDune,1
Yep.,LW Mugetsu,1
That also brings up an interesting question about exos. Does their age start when they were created or does it start over when they reset?,LW Mugetsu,1
"Interesting, they must age, because otherwise Ada-1 would still be a baby mentally",RonInDune,1
But if they kept aging there'd be people who'd be 500 years old,RonInDune,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
Well technically we don't know how long ago the collapse happened so it could have been centuries or millinea.,LW Mugetsu,1

There's so much here that I don't understand but it sounds super interesting,Trissin,1
"There's lots of things hidden in secret lore tabs or item descriptions, kinda like how Dark souls does it",RonInDune,1
The very first things in the timeline are from the Eris lore that you get by talking to here every week (Unveiling),RonInDune,1
Is that official bungie timeline or someone's best guess?,LW Mugetsu,1
Best guess,RonInDune,1
"It's more or less accurate, but there are a few things, especially around the Great AHamkara hunt that are open to second guessing",RonInDune,1
"I think the Nine are pretty interesting, I'd like to learn more about them",Trissin,1
I love the Nine's aesthetic too!,RonInDune,1

I love it all!,RonInDune,1
aha maybe I'll get into it. I've got soo many lore triumphs I haven't earned/found yet,Trissin,1
"Lore hunting is my main goal in the game lol, it's so good!",RonInDune,1
I feel that it's both a pro and a con that there's not really a place to go to/start to find all the lore,Trissin,1
"True, but atleast they've gotten better since Forsaken",RonInDune,1
"Kind of pushes you to explore and learn about the world in a more ""real"" sense if that makes sense",Trissin,1

😂,LW Mugetsu,1
"Speaking of lore, can anyone help me with a small project? It's regarding ||Paladin Oran||",RonInDune,1
What you need,Crizum,1
"So, I want to go through all the lore that has Paladin Oran in it, and figure out what the hidden messages are",RonInDune,1
"Basically any piece of lore that has ""Paladin Oran"" mentioned, has an acrostic within it",RonInDune,1
Like the message from cayde?,Crizum,1
Exactly,RonInDune,1
">>>  Oh, and, uh, tell ""Paladin Oran"": If the sun over Nessus escapes nebula cycle, evac labor after dawn, under solstice. You got that, P.V.?",RonInDune,1
"The first letters spell out:
>>> Its on Enceladus",RonInDune,1
"And in Letters from Cayde he says:
>>> MESSAGE IS:

You miss me already, huh? If you're looking for another excuse to shirk your Vanguard duties I'll play along.

By the way, thought you'd be interested in this report from Paladin Oran:

"Oh I thought there was an N there, yeah that makes sense people call ||Uldren the Crow||",Crizum,1
my guess is that it ||relates to Mara or Uldren||. given that he was found and ||resurrected as a Guardian. it could mean that he's still always going to lean toward the darkness and always have a quest for power and still should not be trusted especially if he's able to wield Light||,thegoaliebear,1

"Yeah the Savathun one, 999 power and all that",RonInDune,1

but with a group of 3 you can tear through it.,thegoaliebear,1

well the first thing is open resource monitor and see what's running when Destiny is on,RonInDune,1
around 60 both,Trissin,1
nothing else is running,Trissin,1
I've closed everything except for destiny,Trissin,1
drivers and all are all updated,Trissin,1
no windows updates or anything,Trissin,1
i tried unisntalling and reinstalling graphics drivers,Trissin,1
tried playing with power settings and stuff too,Trissin,1
"there might be background services that are hidden, use the resource monitor graph",RonInDune,1
sometimes it's just windows indexing or something,RonInDune,1
Not sure,Trissin,1
and it's got nothing to do with my destiny graphics settings either,Trissin,1
I opened a couple other games and they were also stuck at this low fps,Trissin,1
"but for destiny, as soon as I open my inventory or menu the frames come back",Trissin,1
and i'm fine in orbit too,Trissin,1
Might be RAM issue then? it's slowing down when it's loading up map assets,RonInDune,1
is your game on an SSD,RonInDune,1

it's even better bc it wasn't a gif.,thegoaliebear,1
is there even any raids gong on on pc tonight?,Nexeran,1
ya,thegoaliebear,1
I assume its full up?,Nexeran,1
@Nexeran You can take my place if you want. Feeling pretty exhausted anyways,Peronix,1
that'd be fine. we're also attempting the boss challenge @Nexeran,thegoaliebear,1
"ok ill have to look up the boss challenge, are we doing fresh run or just boss?",Nexeran,1
full run,Crizum,1
ok,Nexeran,1
"ok, i think i understand the challenge, are you doing the 7 motes for the first team?",Nexeran,1
I think that’s how we’ll handle it yeah,Crizum,1
Ok...now I just hope the damn install finishes soon...,Nexeran,1

"great raid folks, lets get the rest of the challenges done whenever we can!",RonInDune,1
damn anmol is probably pissed PC members are even on that Garden list LOL.,thegoaliebear,1
Garden list?,RonInDune,1
in the warmind bot channel.,thegoaliebear,1
Lol why would he be mad?,Crizum,1
oh heck I'm 8th on the list! Mum get the camera!,RonInDune,1
oh @Crizum you don't know from my ps4 experiences haha.,thegoaliebear,1
he's just the best destiny player ever obviously.,thegoaliebear,1
Is he on PC at all? We can do a bridge bulding raid run!,RonInDune,1
Bring together the disparate portions of our clan,RonInDune,1
he does have a pc but ps4 is his main.,thegoaliebear,1
it's better that way.,thegoaliebear,1
oh,RonInDune,1
hahaha yeah.,thegoaliebear,1
*dramatic music*,RonInDune,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
"@Destiny [PC] ^^ for tomorrow night. i'm fine with taking a couple newbies through if yall are available. but since we'll also be doing one of the encounter challenges, if you've never done it before, please watch a video of the raid so you at least have a general idea of what's going on.",thegoaliebear,1
"Did you guys complete the boss challenge last night? I had to step down, I was almost sleeping at my keyboard lol",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yes. so...we will be doing a different challenge. either second or third encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
or the first encounter triumph.,thegoaliebear,1
Can we do all void classes? I still need that one.,LW Mugetsu,1
*all spectral blades run*,Peronix,1
No,LW Mugetsu,1
Just no,LW Mugetsu,1
sure we can do void that's much easier than arc haha.,thegoaliebear,1
idk if i can even do the raid,WhereisRegashi,1
do you have Shadowkeep?,thegoaliebear,1
If you're atleast 940-ish power and have shadowkeep you should be able to do it easy,RonInDune,1
"@Destiny [PC] Looks like all Nightmare Hunts are up on the moon this week, for anyone who wants to go for the Harbinger title",Crizum,1
I'd be down maybe sunday evening if people want to do those. i'm not after the title but down to help out.,thegoaliebear,1
i have shadow keep but im 790 rn,WhereisRegashi,1
oh haha yeah you gotta be like...935 ish to make it through Garden without any issues.,thegoaliebear,1
*ohno*,Hotdog,1
"I thought we had 1 more reset after this one, but this is the last week before season ends",Hotdog,1
I still need a Master NF :derp:,Hotdog,1
what's your light level? it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought,Trissin,1
I ran it with a couple randoms without any comms and we didnt have any problems,Trissin,1
just gotta coordinate weapons and mods,Trissin,1

||**AWWWWW YEAH RETURN OF SAINT-14**||,Trissin,1
||LOL FUCK MERCURY||,Crizum,1
@Trissin ||***HE RETURNS***||,Oathbreaker,1
IM HYPE,Arixama,1
I’m as hype as Datto,Crizum,1
But I’ll still grind out whatever title they give us lol,Crizum,1
||RUSTED LANDS BOYS||,Oathbreaker,1
"also, wasn't the reveal stream supposed to start a little bit ago? am I mistaken or something",Trissin,1
Tomorrow same time,Peronix,1
Tomorrow at 1,Oathbreaker,1

ohhhhh,Trissin,1
lol mb,Trissin,1
"Hey @thegoaliebear lol check out the exotic scout rifle, bet you're happy to be able to enjoy the Season of Randy",Crizum,1
if that's needed for the seasonal title then everything worked out for me lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
i have to be honest i really don't care about saint 14 lol. i just wanna know the seasonal title stuff😂,thegoaliebear,1
"spoiler tags
also i welcome more exotic scouts",Trissin,1
"I didn't really have any problem with the scout kills for randy, it was the medals that was frustrating",Trissin,1
it ain't a spoiler if it's on bungie now haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"hmm, i guess thats fair lol",Trissin,1
"_Sparrows_

oh ok,Crizum,1
Thats good,Crizum,1
good,thegoaliebear,1
Maybe we are getting the ||Mercury vendor refresh|| finally,RonInDune,1
I quite liked the aesthetics of those weapons even though they all felt a bit underpowered,RonInDune,1
Also the trailer had a criminal lack of ||Sagira||,RonInDune,1
There's not gonna be a new raid with this expansion right?,Trissin,1
No I don't think so,RonInDune,1
😢,Trissin,1
:(,Oathbreaker,1
"I don't think I ever actually used the ||Perfect Paradox|| after unlocking it, wonder if it's as good as the hype made it out to be",RonInDune,1
It was a go-to for me in y1,Trissin,1
well then we can all get Enlightened if there's not a new one😜,thegoaliebear,1
*exactly*,RonInDune,1
Trissin,Oathbreaker,1
I'm stealing that picture,Oathbreaker,1
It's mine now,Oathbreaker,1
LOL,Trissin,1
go ahead,Trissin,1
Also I'm happy we get to know more about the ||OXA machine||,RonInDune,1
I used pp all the time in y1. It was a replacement for ep shotty,Arixama,1
Is it a slug shotty? Like Chaperone?,RonInDune,1
"No, rapid fire IIRC",Oathbreaker,1
"perfect, that's my favourite archetype",RonInDune,1
"Hey Oath, rank 100 on the season pass for Reach is 117 voice for Firefight, Eternal flame armor effect and the pilot skull helmet",Crizum,1
Can Reach be installed now? I checked in the morning before leaving and there was nothing there,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, well it installs MCC and Reach is the dlc",Crizum,1
"This is all speculation and stuff, but it seems some people think ||trials might be coming back with season of dawn||",Trissin,1
"I don't think it will happen, but there's discussion of it lol",Trissin,1
||GIVE TRIALS **BUNGO**||,Oathbreaker,1
"Also, we can ||change time to save saint-14 but cayde still dead 🤔 ||",Trissin,1

||I mean they are both Exos.........||,Oathbreaker,1
@RonInDune reach dropped at noon central,Arixama,1
We might be getting more Niobe Labs type puzzles:,RonInDune,1
"six is one less than half of 14, half of 14 is 7, 7 is the number of columns, destiny 7 confirmed",Gimmie2,1
wait no I think it means Final fantasy 7 remake confirmed,RonInDune,1
actually it means that season 7 was the last real season of destiny. everything after is just vex hijinks and our guardian is stuck in simulation for all eternity and activision is using us all as a free source of revenue while we spend all our money on fake eververse items and dlcs,Arixama,1
So kinda like the matrix?,Crizum,1
https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Seasons/SeasonOfDawn,Trissin,1
The last 4K wallpaper is sweet!,RonInDune,1
Wish they made some mobiles ones too,RonInDune,1
||new exotic sidearm??||,Trissin,1
"oh crap, I just thought about something",Trissin,1
season of the undying pass gives these perks which boost the rate at which you gain progress for the eriana's vow catalyst,Trissin,1
that's gonna be going away right?,Trissin,1
"so after season of undying, finishing the catalyst for erianas is gonna be super slow?",Trissin,1
The quest to unlock it at least I think,Arixama,1
"yeah, the progress bar",Trissin,1
where strikes give like 0.5% or something,Trissin,1
"Gambit give 2 percent, crucible give like 1 percent",Arixama,1
Currently,Arixama,1
"yeah and that's with the perks from the season pass, right?",Trissin,1
The season is like a 3x ~ 4x multiplier,RonInDune,1
I might just buckle up and play like 50 games of gambit prime this week,RonInDune,1
i wonder what will be the fastest way to do it,Trissin,1
still Gambit Prime I think,RonInDune,1
"Probably momentum control honestly. The matches are way faster, but I'm not sure if they're half the length of a gambit match",Arixama,1
I was thinking about that too,Trissin,1
and strikes can be run quickly as well,Trissin,1
"but I guess the advantage of gambit prime is you are also sorta farming the gambit weapons/gear, which is rewarding",Trissin,1
I feel like strikes are for sure slowest,Arixama,1
not as slow as regular gambit,Trissin,1
soooooo,Buttkikker,1
mercury is coming back...,Buttkikker,1
damn,Buttkikker,1
"In real life, we'll back in Mercury in 2025!",RonInDune,1
(That's when ESA's bepicolombo mission inserts into Mercury orbit),RonInDune,1
well thats cool at least,Buttkikker,1
I wanted to make that joke the whole day and couldn't find a single setup,RonInDune,1
Sorry for making you my victim,RonInDune,1
so the Sundial activity is gonna be my new Vex Offensive i'm assuming.,thegoaliebear,1
probably,Buttkikker,1
love that.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'm not as excited as before, but as long as the game's getting content updates I'm good",RonInDune,1
I still feel they're still learning from all these mini-DLC/season/what-have-you they've done,RonInDune,1
"Black armory had good content and puzzles, Opulence had Menagerie, Undying had a good loot progression system, Drifter had ... good lore?",RonInDune,1
:(,Buttkikker,1
We're still chasing the high of those first few weeks of Forsaken,RonInDune,1
"Drifter was definitely the worst of the seasons, and i think it suffered mainly because gambit is just...gambit, and it didn't have a new raid. obviously any season that doesn't include a raid will suffer from lack of that pinnacle endgame.",thegoaliebear,1
:(:(:(:(:(,Buttkikker,1
lol. i literally took like 4 weeks off from the game once i got my full notorious set.,thegoaliebear,1
said thanks for that suffering i'm gonna fuck off now and wait for the real content.,thegoaliebear,1
but i think with the season passes it gives incentive to keep logging in to do bounties. activities like VO and hopefully the Sundial thing will be an easy way to facilitate leveling.,thegoaliebear,1
"I kept on during Drifter Season just to get the lore, the IX was a fairly interesting faction. The reckoning arena was beautiful too, it's just the activity itself was kinda meh",RonInDune,1
the lore was interesting but not interesting enough to keep me playing that awful season when i could just read it on ishtar hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
true lol,RonInDune,1
"I think I spent most of the season finishing activities completely unrelated to the season, catching up on Y1 stuff that I hadn't done cause I didn't have the game",RonInDune,1
"Finished up most exotic quests, the Mercury stuff, all the Black Armoury questlines",RonInDune,1
"Very damning stuff for Season of the Drifter, in retrospect",RonInDune,1
Suggestion:,RonInDune,1
i haven't taken it off of my titan since i got it,Buttkikker,1
It's a very pretty emblem!,RonInDune,1
"btw, what do y'all think of the new season pass armour?",RonInDune,1
sleek as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
also...putting on the saint 14 emblem would require me giving up my Guardian aesthetics so...no thanks lol.,thegoaliebear,1
but I see potential for another Elsa themed look with that season pass armour lolol.,thegoaliebear,1
"Plus with the solar buffs coming up, ||Elsa and Anna|| cosplays are doable",RonInDune,1
i agree.,thegoaliebear,1
and i think i'm going to make my Titan for a Kristoff kind of vibe.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh shit,Arixama,1
Excuse me while I attempt to throw together and Anna hunter,Arixama,1
no make it Honeymaren @Arixama 😜,thegoaliebear,1
think about the ENERGY,thegoaliebear,1
But the color palletr,Arixama,1
true...the solar colors fit Anna way more.,thegoaliebear,1
So they just gave Titan a Warlock helmet with a steel Mohawk and called it a day?,Crizum,1
Like you could fit that titan helm to the current vex warlock helmet like a puzzle piece,Crizum,1
Wonder if the cash money set will be equally as nice but less derivative,Crizum,1
They all have Mohawks because it's saint14 themed?,Arixama,1
ironic that for a season partly centered on saint 14 the titan gets the ugliest looking set lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
I already have that helmet lol,Crizum,1
either that or the destiny universe has discovered punk rock,RonInDune,1
The titan is front and center isn't it?,Arixama,1
"Look at that warlock helmet, now back to the titan helmet. COOL",Crizum,1
the titan helmet is way different ?? if anything the new warlock helmet is the same thing with a mohawk.,thegoaliebear,1
Oh my god you are right that is somehow worse hahaha,Crizum,1
I thought that was a warlock cape and not a titan mark,Crizum,1
But that just means warlocks got the same helmet twice lol,Crizum,1
i can't complain because the warlock set still looks good.,thegoaliebear,1
the titan helmet looks like a variation of the warlock trials helmet.,thegoaliebear,1
so in conclusion: ugly.,thegoaliebear,1
That warlock helmet looks 10 times better than the current warlock helm to me,Arixama,1
"Lol, the hunter reminds me of blade smith/great hunt a bit",Crizum,1
The mask at least,Crizum,1
"hunter set, yet again, is best looking one 😜",thegoaliebear,1
warlock set is clean as well. will be interesting to see how they take shaders lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Also that titan is 100% master chief posing,Crizum,1

What shields are in Savathun's Song?,Hotdog,1
"Mostly void and arc, I believe the wanted enemy is solar but you can ignore them",Crizum,1
wizards are solar aren't they?,RonInDune,1
in savathun's they're void i think.,thegoaliebear,1
ah I see,RonInDune,1
"Well the ones near the crystal are void, idk how many other ones there are, I think just the wanted enemy",Crizum,1
"Alright i'll loadout for void/arc, thanks!",Hotdog,1

sweet. which challenge do we think we want to try? maybe the one where only the people with the voltaic buff tether... and that one is at the first encounter right?,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah that’s the first, I’m watching some videos for them, may be able to knock two out depending",Crizum,1
sweet. I'm down for whatever.,thegoaliebear,1
"also @Destiny [PC] I'd like to set up a sherpa Garden run for Sunday night, 8:30 EST. I'd like to have the team comp be 3 experienced players and 3 newbies. so if you've never done the raid before and you can commit to that time let me know and I'll set up an lfg post for it!",thegoaliebear,1
and obviously if we only end up with one or two newbies we can fill in experienced players from there. but i know there are still people who haven't done it!,thegoaliebear,1
@thegoaliebear I know for a fact that @MrJ and @Snorlax will want to do that,Yeti,1
I'm down for sherpa ing if needed,RonInDune,1
Pay to forward!,RonInDune,1
@MrJ @Snorlax ^^^^,Yeti,1
okay sweet. I'll just make sure that time is good with everyone before i set up a post to get it organized.,thegoaliebear,1
"Woah, @RonInDune that wallpaper they are gonna release on the stream",Crizum,1
Wonder what the Empyrean Foundation is,Peronix,1
Maybe a dungeon?,Crizum,1
"I hope we get good loot from it, the armor ornaments were really cool",Trissin,1
Could just be a different map? Like three maps for the new mode instead of just the one?,Crizum,1
"I'm inclined to believe your suggestion of it being a Dungeon. If it related to the Sundial, I'd feel they'd label it as Sundial: Foundation",Peronix,1
Oh god that hunter armor is sweet,Crizum,1
Seasons' already worth it with that armor,Peronix,1
I'm tempted to buy the empyrean ornaments for hunter + warlock becaues I always forgot to log in and pick them up with bright dust,Trissin,1
Enhanced sniper loader is on the artifact,Crizum,1

oh dang @Trissin I didn't realize you had Undying already! Great work!,RonInDune,1
Haha thanks! I picked up randy's on monday evening and that was the last thing I needed for the title,Trissin,1
Are you going for it ron?,Trissin,1
Nah I never really enjoyed Vex Offensive enough to grind out the weapon kills. I just wanted to fill out my collections,RonInDune,1
"I do like Randy's quite a bit though, it's a tidy little gun",RonInDune,1
"i haven't used it yet, did not like the fact I had to sell my soul to bungie for it",Trissin,1
I think I Stockholm Syndromed myself into enjoying the grind by the end lol,RonInDune,1
I think I have like 80% accuracy on the Iron Banner scout I used to grind it out,RonInDune,1

Never heard of that hmm,RonInDune,1
omg that's a y1 cluster rocket lol,Trissin,1
used to be the meta,Trissin,1
like a looong time ago,Trissin,1
"huh interesting, I don't see too many legendary rocket launchers in PvP these",RonInDune,1
or even in PvE since the auto reload nerf,RonInDune,1
"yeah, they aren't very good anymore",Trissin,1
"even vs. riven, grenade launchers are just better",Trissin,1
"Yup, by quite a lot",RonInDune,1
"Speaking of raid bosses, anyone want to run 3x Scourge and be extremely disappointed?",RonInDune,1
well we have our GoS run tonight and then I'm out until Sunday.,thegoaliebear,1
Hmm,RonInDune,1
I'll try to lure people into Scourge with promises of guaranteed Anarchy/Fallen Armaments,RonInDune,1
BTW I started playing Reach and the fact that I can't ADS is really messing with me,RonInDune,1
Also the crosshair is weirdly low on the screen,RonInDune,1
You can center it I think?,Crizum,1
"I'll have to look that up, I don't know why it's so strange by default. Is it a console thing?",RonInDune,1
Best I can tell it’s a rumored Bungie thing?,Crizum,1
?_?,RonInDune,1
Depending on what you trust I guess bullets were shooting below the crosshair in 3 and they couldn’t figure out why so they just lowered the cross hair to compensate and just rolled with it in future games,Crizum,1
"Dunno how true it is, but Bungie",Crizum,1
lol that honestly sounds exactly like a software solution so I'm inclined to believe it,RonInDune,1
if people knew the number of weird bugs I passed off as features I'd never get a job,RonInDune,1
"I wish Destiny could do some of the stupid game types Halo has haha, the action sack playlist alone makes for stupid fun",Crizum,1
"Played Dino Blasters, all elites with infinite jet packs and concussive blast launchers",Crizum,1
"I just started the campaign yesterday, going to go into PvP after I finish that",RonInDune,1
"Also I swear the Covenent spoke English in Halo 2, but they don't in Reach",RonInDune,1
"It’s a bit of space magic, Reach takes place before CE so you don’t understand them yet I guess. In the Invasion game type they do speak English when you are playing as the elites",Crizum,1
"hmmm, I remember liking the Reach book even though I don't remember a thing about it now, might read it again now for the lore",RonInDune,1
I think the game changed a bit of the lore from the book,Crizum,1

"wait so does the season pass include the ""premium battle pass"" for lack of a better term?",Buttkikker,1
I thought it would be separate from the actual gameplay content,Buttkikker,1
The season pass is the season of dawn paid content and the 100 levels of rewards,Arixama,1
ok sweet!,Buttkikker,1

can confirm that's how it ~~is~~ was,Trissin,1
it's fine. i have an exam that night so i likely won't be back until 8-8:15ish.,thegoaliebear,1

It's so easy to do too,Arixama,1
With the release of new light you can replay all the year 1 campaigns if you want.,Arixama,1
i wonder if there are any new members who havent played through curse yet? it would be a great opportunity for them to join u,Trissin,1
because ngl the campaigns are a bit stale solo,Trissin,1
I remember the heroic CoO missions were super short so I grinded the hell out of them for something,RonInDune,1
we could definitely check. I'd be down to go through those campaigns with new people.,thegoaliebear,1
the emblem tracker? 👀,Trissin,1
or wait that was heroic adventures,Trissin,1
I think it was for lore and the Mercury weapons,RonInDune,1
You don't have to tell me how stale the campaigns are. I've done the year 1 campaigns so many times,Arixama,1
same ahahah,Trissin,1
"I unironically love the start of the Red War campaign, it gets dull after we get to Titan",RonInDune,1

13?!,Arixama,1
ok 13 deleted chars has to be a record lol,RonInDune,1
LOL,Trissin,1
What's the Arcadia?,RonInDune,1
"the ship, right?",Trissin,1
the original ship,Trissin,1
ohhh,RonInDune,1
i guess you guys don't remember at launch,Matos,1
Yup. You can only get it from doing the intro mission,Arixama,1
you could redo the exotic quests and it dropped at a LL upgrade,Matos,1
woah,RonInDune,1
"so i would level a toon, get mida/rat king etc. transfer and delete",Matos,1
And we wonder why you hate d2 😂,Arixama,1

i did more moon grinding,Matos,1
yea i'm losing steam at lvl 45,Matos,1
for the annual pass?,RonInDune,1
Yeah the moon grind for exp sucks,RonInDune,1
trissin challenged me tog et 100,Matos,1
i don't think its happening,Matos,1

how many bounties for a level up?,Trissin,1
"off the top of my head, 12-ish",Matos,1
wait what?? really??,Trissin,1
"thats way more than I thought, mb",Trissin,1

yea i've been bouncing around stuff while working on ritual weapons,Matos,1

You're still the Gambit king around here I think,RonInDune,1

Do different characters get the 5 level bonus or is it account based?,Arixama,1

Most definitely not,RonInDune,1
But they're rotating that out for the season of the dawn content,Arixama,1
Its only the lore that's tied to vex offensive thats going away,Arixama,1
True but the lore itself has no relation to the vex,RonInDune,1
It's a vignette from when the darkness came to the system and what happens to the Titan arcologies,RonInDune,1
It's really good,RonInDune,1
where do you grab it?,Matos,1

Good luck! Discord been a bit fucky today,RonInDune,1
So Datto put out a subjective ranking of all the available titles:,RonInDune,1
"Seems fair, though I'd put Reckoner higher due to the sheer amount of grinding required",RonInDune,1
I believe the ruleset for that one was less about grinding and more about difficult tasks.,Infernosi,1
"True, his own ranking was different",RonInDune,1
"Reckoner leapfrogged even Unbroken (which I could understand, that's a LOOOONG and difficult at times grind) on Datto's personal list",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah and I agree with with Datto that the one triumph which requires more skill than anything else in the game is Unbroken,RonInDune,1
Especially with the changes in Glory/freelance mode to make it where it much faster to get to Unbroken,Infernosi,1
3x Legend is easier with new matchmaking honestly.,Oathbreaker,1
"Getting Legend once is by far the most difficult part of the entire game, let alone 3 times",RonInDune,1
Reckoner is just pure lengthy torture,Infernosi,1
True,RonInDune,1
But everyone who has Unbroken has done atleast two cllimbs to legend without this season's boosts,RonInDune,1
I'd say that the freelance mode has helped more,Infernosi,1
Easier to thrive by yourself if teammates are hard to come by,Infernosi,1
"True, the solo mode has been a blessing",RonInDune,1
(This is the full list Datto made btw),RonInDune,1
I wouldn't put reckoner very high tbh. it's literally just tedious grinding and gambit prime/reckoning wasn't great so people literally just did not give a single shit about it.,thegoaliebear,1
I'd rank any of the raid titles as the highest tbh.,thegoaliebear,1
"Rivensbane is probably the hardest title after Unbroken, imo",RonInDune,1
Flawless Last Wish is incredibly difficult,RonInDune,1
Only beaten by Flawless solo dungeons,RonInDune,1
because you actually need a skilled team that can pull of flawless raids and challenges. and then I'd put Unbroken along with them.,thegoaliebear,1
"For blacksmith, can you go to orbit for the sparrow section and come back in?",RonInDune,1
"other than swapping those, I agree with the rest of the list",thegoaliebear,1
and yes you can.,thegoaliebear,1
the communities list is way better tbh haha.,thegoaliebear,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
okay wait I forgot about this haha. if it fills up then I won't be around for scourge. but if it doesn't then obviously I'll do the scourge runs.,thegoaliebear,1
@Kimarais/Nick we have a couple spots open for scourge runs tomorrow night. if the garden sherpa run doesn't fill would you like to join us? we will do the full scourge x1 with x3 at the final boss for Anarchy farm before the drop rate gets buffed lol.,thegoaliebear,1

@thegoaliebear i think that it was a glitch cause by the fallen ship? cause it vanished and then the glitch vanished,Arixama,1
yeah it could have been. it was wild haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"If we get those challenges done then we should plan for a flawless run too, we could all get enlightened at once",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, I was thinking that but flawless would be some work so that’s almost like a weekend gig when people have less school/games?",Crizum,1
True true,RonInDune,1
i'm down to get flawless whenever. i don't have a ton of time tomorrow night or this week to spend on challenge runs but i'm sure we'll be able to get them done.,thegoaliebear,1
once i'm on break and recovering from getting the rest of my wisdom teeth out tho...lol...i'll have plenty of time to raid.,thegoaliebear,1
Flawless is an all radiance warlock run,Crizum,1
what about bubble 😢,Trissin,1
"Haha, well it’s anything that can survive so that’s also good",Crizum,1
no hunters allowed,RonInDune,1
i don't think flawless is as bad as you think lol,Trissin,1
"But the more Phoenix protocols the better, who needs to bother with building",Crizum,1
ah. that makes sense,Trissin,1
"Oh, the hardest part of flawless? 100% the boss team on third encounter falling down holes",Crizum,1
yeah honestly we have had several runs where we literally do the boss flawlessly as well as that second encounter.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah? I actually think it might be the little maze area between the first encounter and the second encounter,Trissin,1
if you bring a bunch of warlocks,Trissin,1
people gon fall,Trissin,1
traversing between encounters will probably be the real flawless killer,Arixama,1
"^^
that's what it was for wish and scourge",Trissin,1
yeah tbh any jumping part usually ends up being the most difficult.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah true, well the good news is if one person makes it and everyone else knows the roles and has decent ammo it’s not bad",Crizum,1
you could also just have everyone leave and rejoin,Trissin,1
"Good thing is the first encounter is so quick, that we can practice the the undrgrowrth area a bit",RonInDune,1
destiny needs fortnite building mechanics :derp:,Arixama,1
everybody should always be ready to alt f4 in an instant,Trissin,1
i remember for Crown...jumping from platform to platform had our palms SO sweaty.,thegoaliebear,1
Maybe this weekend,Crizum,1
If we're not going for the chest then we don't need to take the hard path anyway,RonInDune,1
If we only need a flawless I could put time in Friday or Sunday,Crizum,1
i'd be down to try a flawless run over the weekend. Sunday night is probably best for me yeah. Friday i have an exam and am bringing my stuff home.,thegoaliebear,1
Sunday works for me too,RonInDune,1

"ah, ok yeah we can wait",RonInDune,1
"the thing about flawless activities, they are both so stressful but so fun at the same time",Trissin,1

"""I don't want to be nervous so I'll overload my body on caffeine"" 😂",Arixama,1
"two negatives make a positive, so I'll turn into a super calm machine",RonInDune,1
Drink a vodka redbull every flawless failure,Arixama,1
how do die from alcohol poising 101,Yeti,1
"i'm excited for this now, it's gonna be a lot of fun",Trissin,1
sadly I don't drink alcohol but that's indeed a good suggestion,RonInDune,1
This thread will be exibhit number 1 in a murder trial,RonInDune,1
Well if you don't drink alcohol *just don't die*,Arixama,1
^,Trissin,1
No problem!,Arixama,1
ooh I totally have enough alcohol for that hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
"just curious @thegoaliebear , did you do your flawless raids on ps4 with our clan members? or did you know other people or LFG a group",Trissin,1
it was all ps4 clan members.,thegoaliebear,1
some of the other challenges I did get done with other groups tho. but flawless was always with clanmates.,thegoaliebear,1
ah I see,Trissin,1
Has our PC clan attempted a flawless yet trissin?,RonInDune,1
"I'm wondering if there's interest to flawless scourge, crown, on the pc side of the clan",Trissin,1
I don't believe so,Trissin,1
"I am yeah, would be nice to get some of the older titles",Crizum,1
I'm down for all of them honestly,RonInDune,1
It's actually pretty fun,Trissin,1
All I'm missing for Shadow are all of the flawless runs,RonInDune,1

Does Rumble have SBMM?,RonInDune,1
Crucible with the exception of the Control playlist has SBMM,Oathbreaker,1
ah,RonInDune,1
hmm,Buttkikker,1
comp is a weird exception though,Oathbreaker,1
"there have been matches where I absolutely roll the other team, and other matches where it's like tourney grand finals sweaty",Oathbreaker,1
You may be getting bought forgottens? Or people who paid for recluse/mt who in the system have skill levels similar to yours but in reality they don’t?,Crizum,1
Or it’s the SBMM enforcing a close to 50% win ratio?,Crizum,1
"That true, elim was fairly low scoring anyway",RonInDune,1
comp seems far more volatile with its matchmaking because sometimes ill win 2-3 games in a row and then i can tell I'm facing a whole new set of people all the sudden,Buttkikker,1
"That one match was an exception, around 10 mins after the season just dropped",RonInDune,1

DY1-Y2 was similar. Y3 was a clusterfuck.,Oathbreaker,1
What happened in Y3?,RonInDune,1
Played Rusted Lands and had a lot of fun with it,Crizum,1
I just think personally I don’t connect with D2 maps like I did D1,Crizum,1
see @Crizum once people are done with the quest i'll be happy to just go back to the good part of the game 😜,thegoaliebear,1
It was weird and maybe I’m off base,Crizum,1
"But Destiny has a much more vertical play style than Halo, but all the maps seem so much more horizontal if that makes sense?",Crizum,1

Yeah the only map with verticality is that one Nessus map,RonInDune,1
"Regardless, I enjoy playing PvP a lot because there's nothing like the feeling of absolutely dunking on someone in the Crucible. That, or dropping an absolutely massive game in terms of kills. I don't quite know how to explain it really.",Oathbreaker,1
i applaud that because i will always hate it and think it's trash. i'm the exact opposite i think it's stale as hell.,thegoaliebear,1
It’s got high peaks and low lows for me,Crizum,1
For me it depends on how the matchmaking think I should play,CrizMobius,1
yeah the high of having a rip roaring game in the crucible is amazing,RonInDune,1
"When I’m dunking I feel amazing, when I’m getting shat on by Unbrokens from on high with MT I want to uninstall",Crizum,1
i think the last time i low key enjoyed things was when i was getting Revoker. sniping is very satisfying and i got pretty decent at running with that play style.,thegoaliebear,1
REVOKER,RonInDune,1
You’ll maybe enjoy Arbalest,Crizum,1
i think it'll still be painful for me. but the one shots are satisfying for me.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah the sniper grind felt nice, I also liked the initial steps of Redrix, it just went on too long",RonInDune,1
"This season the quests aren’t as harsh, so I’m having more fun",Crizum,1
i agree. randy's made me so mad lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"I've been using the Sunshot to get solar kills for Lunas, it feels nice",RonInDune,1
"D1Y1 and Y2 had much more skill expression in terms of capability of what you could do. With regards to what was going on in the later years was that much more skill-less shit was being buffed, causing things to be less interesting @RonInDune",Oathbreaker,1
because the other ones were so damn quick compared.,thegoaliebear,1
oh yeah Oath I remember you talking about a gun that had an rng bullet? that did like high damage randomly?,RonInDune,1
"but they have to force people into pvp now to at least populate it. which, it still doesn't even work because once people have the newest weapons the only people who stay in it are the pvp no-lifes.",thegoaliebear,1
"For me though I've regularly been playing Unbrokens and other incredibly skilled players since about February, so I don't really care what's in the lobby now. I just play.",Oathbreaker,1
"and i think that's the issue, crucible legit does not have any longevity for the general population unless you get forced into it for the purpose of a Title/specific weapon quest.",thegoaliebear,1
Disagree honestly,Oathbreaker,1
"I have no problem playing aginst good people if the team I play with are good as well, then at least I can learn something but usually its me and blueberries vs unbrokens",CrizMobius,1
"Reason being is that PvE is the same thing over and over again, PvP has variation in who you're playing",Oathbreaker,1
"i mean, once i got Randy's i didn't even look at the crucible section of the game. and lots of other people did the same.",thegoaliebear,1
That's because that quest was long and grindy bullshit. It drained any potential enjoyment you might've gotten from the Crucible,Oathbreaker,1
"PvE has so many specific challenges within the various activities tho, many of them challenging you to play with certain weapons/classes/etc. with pvp it's like...go use this weapon for x amount of time and then never touch that shit again because there's nothing else to chase after that.",thegoaliebear,1
"but i digress, because you enjoy crucible.",thegoaliebear,1
and i hate it.,thegoaliebear,1
and literally nothing will change that for me lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Not disagreeing that there needs to be something more to chase for PvP,Oathbreaker,1
"because really, there's nothing at all.",Oathbreaker,1
An endgame would be nice for it,Infernosi,1
"like, i *tried* to find some kind of enjoyment with it, but i literally could not. every game became a matter of ""how long until this garbage is over"" or ""how many more kills until i'm done with this shit?""",thegoaliebear,1
The PvE challenges you do once though and get a triumph. Similar to what you're saying with Crucible,Oathbreaker,1
but at least there's an actual endgame in PvE.,thegoaliebear,1
"It's similar statements, not quite the *exact* same thing I understand, but it's really similar.",Oathbreaker,1
the raid challenges can be tedious at times but there are some that legitimately challenge your team. i can't tell you how many pvp players i've come across that have never even touched a raid in the game.,thegoaliebear,1
"The PvP community has been asking for a true PvP endgame for a while now, since Trials got yoinked from the game.",Oathbreaker,1
just add trials back in already.,thegoaliebear,1
then the sweats can go back on that.,thegoaliebear,1
+1 for trials,RonInDune,1
and we'll get left alone with it lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"Sweats will be everywhere goal, no matter what",Oathbreaker,1
yeah i know lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"pvp is also extremely unwelcoming to new players, which is also why it has no longevity.",thegoaliebear,1
"To varying degrees at least. And with trials, there'll be something to direct them.",Infernosi,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
"I wouldn't say no longevity, but it is pretty rough.",Infernosi,1
"for the weekend, at least.",thegoaliebear,1
With SBMM newer players do have a better intro into the game,Oathbreaker,1
Not saying it's perfect,Oathbreaker,1
Needs more guidance,Infernosi,1
^,thegoaliebear,1
"Not disagreeing, but what kind of guidance *should* there be?",Oathbreaker,1
"if you don't have at least something within the meta or a decent roll, you're not going to feel good or encouraged to play it.",thegoaliebear,1
Maybe an optional short quest in a private match breaking down how it works/expectations.,Infernosi,1
"i think that would be better. because right now, at least for new players it's just like, you get your weekly milestone, maybe you try for the ritual weapon because hey, it really isn't *that* bad, but then you never go back to it unless you have to.",thegoaliebear,1
"Lots of things are within the meta rn. Additionally, there are some things that won't really be within the meta just due to the nature of how they work (for example, Auto Rifles)",Oathbreaker,1
"without really any tutorial or something to really break down how shit works, it's just like...why am i just getting shit on by all these people with Unbroken and Not Forgotten ?? what even are those ? how do i get them ? what even *is* meta ?",thegoaliebear,1
"Right now, I'm still trying to coax some of my friends who recently started Destiny into trying pvp, but they're too intimidated.",Infernosi,1
^^,thegoaliebear,1
"Also, what goal said.",Infernosi,1
"I feel like the problem with a pvp endgame is that it will naturally devolve in to one or two builds with maximum cheese potential, everyone will know it’s a problem but nobody will agree on how to fix it",Crizum,1
^^ that too.,thegoaliebear,1
Pvp requires more out of a player compared to regular strikes.,Infernosi,1
"Yeah, again, not disagreeing, just idk how it'll be able to be done.",Oathbreaker,1
Won't its flawed presence still be better than its absence?,Infernosi,1
"i feel like pvp will always be in a state of like, this purgatory kind of thing. where whenever a new update for it or whatever happens, it'll seem great at first but then just reverts back to a few select builds that are annoying as hell and a dead population.",thegoaliebear,1
If something is good on pvp it becomes a real problem QUICK,Crizum,1
yes that.,thegoaliebear,1
A lightning rod,Crizum,1
What would you all say the current outliers in general play are?,Infernosi,1
see @Infernosi personally i am one of those people who legitimately would not notice if they took pvp out of the game entirely lol.,thegoaliebear,1
And that's 100% ok.,Infernosi,1
Maybe they can fix it with the seasonal metas they are trying,Crizum,1
Well first things first is they need to remove artifact mods from all forms of PvP.,Oathbreaker,1
and that's also part of the problem.,thegoaliebear,1
because there are so many players like me who never even give a second thought to pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
unless we have to.,thegoaliebear,1
"I'd say the big ones, yes. Still on the fence about the smaller ones like enhanced targeting, at least for general play. Would need convincing for them to be in comp/trials.",Infernosi,1
Enhanced targeting is already in the game,Crizum,1
Seasonal mods just cost way less to equip,Crizum,1
That's what I was referring to.,Infernosi,1
"It can cause meta shifts, but I don't know if it'll be too big a problem for high-level play.",Infernosi,1
yeah i mean the biggest issue is that the exact same weapon/armor pool is available for use within both aspects of the game. and you can't equally balance things to function properly within both realms.,thegoaliebear,1
so they have to let one aspect of the game suffer and that will always be the side that's naturally had a much lower player draw.,thegoaliebear,1
"Okay, well then tier 4 and 5 only. Leaving things in that break the game in a way from T4 or T5 of the artifact means that the people who complain that PvP is unbalanced as shit should be just as pissed off that the armor mods are active in PvP creating a messy situation.",Oathbreaker,1
"Idk, I can see the argument that crucible kept the game alive in some content droughts",Crizum,1
and IIRC that's why they mentioned they would eventually have to drop support for one of the gambit modes?,thegoaliebear,1
And they have shown they can adjust weapons separately,Crizum,1
Agreed,Infernosi,1
"Why would they ""have"" to let some aspects of the game suffer?",Oathbreaker,1
i think the removal of trials was the biggest mistake with it.,thegoaliebear,1
"Not dropped support, just not continued updates",Crizum,1
More that they only have so many resources.,Infernosi,1
"So we wouldn’t get new maps or adjustments for one or the other, but neither are leaving",Crizum,1
I just think they lack a somewhat solid vision currently?,Crizum,1
"Fair, but if you shouldn't leave things behind that have been in the game since day 1 because you don't have enough resources budgeted for the game if that makes sense.",Oathbreaker,1
"like Rover said, they only have so many resources. naturally, you're going to devote more of those resources to the aspects of the game that pulls the most players. i think they just need to add Trials back regardless of what state they have it in.",thegoaliebear,1
"If that happens, there better need to be a damn good reason.",Oathbreaker,1
That would be a mistake haha,Crizum,1
"Right now, I think crucible team is working on trials, and getting that absolutely perfect, since they have to, and so it feels slow.",Infernosi,1
"Well maybe not, but I think if it comes out unbalanced and under supported it looks worse than not coming out at all",Crizum,1
They have gotten more active on that front at least.,Infernosi,1
ehhh...Trials was always a big pull for sweats and even players who just wanted to try out that kind of focused mode.,thegoaliebear,1
And it had rewards for every tier of player.,Infernosi,1
Bit of armor at 5.,Infernosi,1
^^ that too.,thegoaliebear,1
Weapons at 7.,Infernosi,1
Then flawless.,Infernosi,1
"What about like, random roll guns in the loot pool, but ritual style weapons for higher tier players",Crizum,1
"A trials specific title, not having the weapons tied to the season pass etc",Crizum,1
"as bad as trials was, you could have a clear goal in mind and continue to grind out for it, which in turn promotes getting better at the game and learning maps and all that good shit. whereas with the structure of ritual weapons, it's just like...let me suffer for x amount of time and be done with it.",thegoaliebear,1
"and yes, Trials adds room for another Title.",thegoaliebear,1
"Depending on the rolls, better players would just try to farm for the god roll. Doesn't solve the issue Crizum",Oathbreaker,1
"Like, sure you got X gun and filled out the badge, but this person went flawless, they can get a gun with every possible scope to choose from, or a larger perk pool",Crizum,1
"i just think Trials promotes a lot of more positive goals players can set for themselves. how it is now, it's just ""do this as quickly as you can and don't touch the mode again until you have to""",thegoaliebear,1
Get nutty and put perks on weapons that don’t normally have them,Crizum,1
Something like that would be a good solution Crizum.,Oathbreaker,1
"Like a pulse with firing line, is it any good I dunno, but would be interesting and promote team play",Crizum,1
no god no,Oathbreaker,1
don't do that roll,Oathbreaker,1
Haha,Crizum,1
then we get S3 meta again,Oathbreaker,1
"i'd like to see Trials come back. personally i don't care what state it ends up being in, because i know people will complain about it no matter what, but if they're definitely working on it then it would add a lot of room for more of an ""endgame"" for pvp.",thegoaliebear,1
something is better than nothing.,Oathbreaker,1
I think this seasons quests are proof they are listening,Crizum,1
"The kills and precision shots aren’t an insane amount, a lot of the quest can be completed by your team doing well",Crizum,1
It feels actually reasonable this time around.,Infernosi,1
"yeah, thank god.",thegoaliebear,1
"The weapons aren’t godly, but the quest reflects that",Crizum,1
"They're interesting, unique rolls.",Infernosi,1
"Sidearm is closer to pinnacle, but tame.",Infernosi,1
But when do weapon quests correlate to how good a weapon is?,Oathbreaker,1
"If that's the case, then Not Forgotten should still be the PvP king bar none.",Oathbreaker,1
"Haha, well you got me there",Crizum,1
I do see what you're trying to get at though,Oathbreaker,1
"It’s hard again, because if NF IS the king people will naturally want it for PvE, and if it was mostly unattainable (I speak from the perspective of people who don’t have the time/energy to dedicate themselves to getting better, not that it’s impossible) it becomes a salt mine",Crizum,1
"Which I do agree partially with, the more difficult the quest should reflect the better the weapon IMO. That doesn't quite mean that it should be long as hell though",Oathbreaker,1
Divinity felt like a good PvE example of that,Infernosi,1
"Hard, yet worthwhile.",Infernosi,1
"Divinity was awesome, an actual quest and not a low drop rate preventing completion of a seal haha",Crizum,1
"And maybe with tuning things in different areas it’ll get better, but I feel like they want the guns to feel consistent, like your guardian is consistent across all aspects of the game",Crizum,1
NF wasn't something people really wanted for PvE though? Other guns out DPS'd. Literally one team that I'm aware of attempted to use it in Last Wish day 1.,Oathbreaker,1
So power fantasy PvE runs race first in to “oh I’m not ACTUALLY a god” PvP,Crizum,1
"Mountaintop was though, I will concede that.",Oathbreaker,1
MT got a class ability and exotic armor nerfed hahaha,Crizum,1
"Just played my first game of survival of the season , matching aginst people with not forgotten at 0 glory",CrizMobius,1
"The new Grenade Launcher from the Tangled shore is pretty good, but MT is in a class of its own",RonInDune,1
"Comp, is skill based, not rank based",Infernosi,1
The wave based grenade launchers are cool,Infernosi,1
Martyr’s Retribution Ron?,Crizum,1
Well I mean Trissin and I had our area cleared for Crown so fucking quick lmao. We had it done on average a full 20-30s before anyone else before the auto-reload nerfs,Oathbreaker,1
They gave everyone thermite grenade haha,Crizum,1
i think recluse pulled more pve players into pvp tbh. it's still way more viable and there are a lot of other kinetic weapons you'd rather be using than MT at this point.,thegoaliebear,1
Namely Izanagis,Infernosi,1
Yep,Oathbreaker,1
Hahaha,Crizum,1
idk...i just think the ritual weapons as they are now run into the same issues of leaving pvp without any longevity for players who dislike/just don't play it.,thegoaliebear,1
Nothing they do in pvp will make people who don’t like pvp play it though right?,Crizum,1
The rituals I don't think should be the form of longevity,Infernosi,1
Yep,Infernosi,1
Unless they fundamentally change something,Crizum,1
Same thing as gambit,Infernosi,1
"idk how they handle it moving forward, and quite frankly i'm someone who doesn't care. i'll go into the mode when i have to in order to get what i need for a title, and then i'm outta there. but i get there are people who really enjoy it and want to see something good done with it.",thegoaliebear,1
"If people don't like it, they won't want to play it",Infernosi,1
Which depending on what they change may drive away the core of the Crucible,Oathbreaker,1
"the bigger issue is that, yeah.",thegoaliebear,1
they're never going to make a full population of people happy. and that's just human nature.,thegoaliebear,1
They should just add building and a battle royal mode,Crizum,1
lmaoooo,thegoaliebear,1
"Don't get me wrong, I agree with you guys for a lot of the points your making. I wish there was better ways to improve the PvP experience for some people who don't play it normally.",Oathbreaker,1
The learning curve is steep and it requires a lot of prep work to get to a state where you feel competitive I think,Crizum,1
I mean,Oathbreaker,1
Yes and no,Oathbreaker,1
CammyCakes just put out an hour long video I'd suggest looking into where he gears up a truly F2P account,Oathbreaker,1
CammyCakes is also CammyCakes haha,Crizum,1
"Granted, that's Cammy, but it's still doable.",Oathbreaker,1
Just takes some dedication.,Oathbreaker,1
"That covers gear, not skill/game knowledge.",Infernosi,1
"I agree with Crizum, it's not noob friendly because it's not just gun play and skill",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Also you need the low tier players to stick around,Crizum,1
Need an ecosystem,Crizum,1
"i think there will just always be aspects of the game people connect with more as well. i have never connected with pvp to a point where i ever cared about learning maps and what was considered ""meta"" for it. and it'll always be that way for me. and there are a lot more players who simply don't have and don't want to put in the time to learn it.",thegoaliebear,1
If there is nobody for the middle to flex on why would they stick around to get flexed on?,Crizum,1
"Right, and I'm kinda the inverse of that Goal, which is fine and understandable. Nothing wrong with either side.",Oathbreaker,1
"So you end up with people leaving because they don’t get the highs, and so remaining games get sweaty",Crizum,1
And the bottom needs something so they can enjoy themselves.,Infernosi,1
i think Rover's idea of a tutorial for new players is good ?? like...if you don't know anything then you're not really going to be encouraged to learn such a small aspect of the game when they have literally anything else to play in the game.,thegoaliebear,1
"As for preference, I'd say that I play both sides equally, although general pvp is what I do to kill time.",Infernosi,1
Destiny asks a lot of people I think,Crizum,1
I’ve been playing since day 1 and I still don’t understand why Rangefinder on X is godly but a total waste of a slot on Y,Crizum,1
"At the end of the day too, I've put in a shitton of time to get better at PvP and understand a bunch about that side of the game",Oathbreaker,1
"a non bs mode could be enjoyable for newcomers and casuals. a mode without sups and without the ohk bs or give the ohk bs to everyone. like every melee is ohk, so a noob wont die to a titan punch then punch the same guy for no dmg",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I don’t think about it too much but from a new player perspective I can see why people get confused and don’t stick with it,Crizum,1
Slight flex time I guess,Oathbreaker,1
!pvp,Oathbreaker,1
"it does. it's a very vast game that has a lot to learn. and it think that's why newer players always gravitate to the pve side, because they won't be impeded by sweats just wanting to ruin someone's day lol. pve ends up being where newer players can test things out and go on their own for a while.",thegoaliebear,1
"Oh, no you totally deserve flex status but that usually breaks down to game and map sense, and eyeballing which encounters are a win",Crizum,1
^^^^ That alone should show how much time I've put in alongside effort,Oathbreaker,1
!pvp,thegoaliebear,1
!pvp,Crizum,1
"i mean, okay lol.",thegoaliebear,1
Wow I throw a lot lol,Crizum,1
and i've hated every single one of those 243 hours.,thegoaliebear,1
HOW,Crizum,1
my win % used to be around 60...then i stopped caring and just prayed to see 100% on whatever quest i had lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
!pvp,Infernosi,1
@thegoaliebear thats what I do lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"like i legitimately will not, at any point, thoroughly *enjoy* my time in pvp haha.",thegoaliebear,1
That hunter k/d life,Crizum,1
Shame time,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"but i will say, pvp is easier for me when i'm playing with others.",thegoaliebear,1
!pvp,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
i will never go into pvp solo at this point. having other people there helps me keep my head haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"I do wish that comp had a point after you get everything from it, aside from 3v3 survival",Infernosi,1
well now in curious,Buttkikker,1
!pvp,Buttkikker,1
!lfg search,Crizum,1
!lfg search,thegoaliebear,1
I'll actually be on around 8:15 now if either of yall wanna play earlier.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm always on so I'm down for early despair,Peronix,1
sounds like a plan. see you on the other side.,thegoaliebear,1
i have prevailed...all 6 essays are done.,thegoaliebear,1
Congrats!,RonInDune,1
"now to look ahead to next semester *looks at schedule* ah, yes...wine appreciation!",thegoaliebear,1
yeah I'll be around,Crizum,1
crucible more like CRUcify me amirite,Peronix,1
mood,thegoaliebear,1
"if anyone would like, i'll be hopping on around 8 EST tomorrow night to finish the crucible emblem quest (at 89%) and finish getting perfect paradox if anyone would want to join.",thegoaliebear,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@Destiny [PC] ^^ ritual weapon stuff for tonight,thegoaliebear,1
May I join? I suck tho,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"oh yeah haha. I'm at 89% for the PvP emblem, so I'll probs only need a few matches to finish it.",thegoaliebear,1
then it'll just be strikes to get the vanguard weapon.,thegoaliebear,1
Haha thanks,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I'll bring my average pvp skill and my trusty arbalest,Kimarais/Nick,1
I've embraced our new chargy laser boi overlord,Kimarais/Nick,1
I didnt even finish randy's but for comp I'll bring my arbalest too,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"lol. it's still awful, but gets to the point of being funny bc that's all people are using.",thegoaliebear,1
"I've been farming randy's in control, progress it's so slow omg",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"^^^
I felt that",Trissin,1
I die a bit inside everytime i play pvp,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I don't think I'll want to do any comp tonight tho. that was way too sweaty last night tbh. might be worth it to wait a bit until the sweaties get to the higher glory rank.,thegoaliebear,1
mood,Trissin,1
"It doesn't even matter though, because it's sbmm and not rank",Trissin,1
we had no consistency with our games the other night.,thegoaliebear,1
so I will not believe that SBMM actually works in this game lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Remember I was around 300 last season getting matched with people 4500+,Trissin,1
Yep @thegoaliebear  tried few matches and it was painful,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"I think sbmm works, maybe I just don't play a lot of PvP lol",Trissin,1
I mean I rarely play it and even when I do play comp I have no consistency with the teams I get matched with.,thegoaliebear,1
"But most games feel really close, unless I am in a FT with someone significantly better/worse than me",Trissin,1
I see,Trissin,1
To me feels most matches are a stomp,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
one game you have the no life stack of Unbrokens and the next you have people who don't even know what the controls of the game are lol.,thegoaliebear,1
its probably  trying to figure out where your supposed to be,Buttkikker,1
that's what I hate about beginning of a new season lol.,thegoaliebear,1
but once the population starts dying out after people get the new weapon it gets a little better.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah, maybe it feels unbalanced because people are just using weapons they are not familiar with for the sake of quests, bounties, etc",Trissin,1
I feel the casual modes like control could be fun if people didnt leave,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah. leaving is still a big issue.,thegoaliebear,1
"""Get kills with grenade in PVP"" always takes me forever and I play horribly because I will always try to get them low, and then throw a nade",Trissin,1
"which like...is hard for Bungie to deal with, because people are always gonna be like that.",thegoaliebear,1
see I just don't bother with anything outside of the weapon quests I need for a *PVE*  title haha,thegoaliebear,1
Yep,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I'll get it over with and then go back to the parts of the game I enjoy.,thegoaliebear,1
"I might go for this season title, I didnt bother with undying",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I think that's my only gripe with the seasonal titles. I hate having to force myself to get a ritual weapon that I'm never gonna use just because collections count for the title,Kimarais/Nick,1
"the ritual grinds this season feel much more ""ritual"" and less ""pinnacle""",Buttkikker,1
whereas last season it was like grinding for mountaintop or somthing but randys,Buttkikker,1
Of all of them the MT grind is actually worth it,RonInDune,1
Such a good gun,RonInDune,1
yeah,Buttkikker,1
That is true,Kimarais/Nick,1
"Yep, I still need to grind mountaintop but  well it takes izanagis spot and in the current state izanagi it's almost mandatory for 980's",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah thats a big deterrent for getting MT,Buttkikker,1
I'll focus on bounties to get more extra levels because I did 980 nightmare hunt yesterday and boss part was hard,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah I never bothered with MT.,thegoaliebear,1
"I wish I had grinded that after they made it easy, it was an absolute nightmare to do normally",RonInDune,1
I did get good with Fighting Lion atleast,RonInDune,1
^,Buttkikker,1
tbh im glad i did the hard version,Buttkikker,1
feels like i earned the power,Buttkikker,1
meh...I've been getting along just fine without it lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"True lol, plus with unnerfed lunafactions it almost outdid every other damage source",RonInDune,1
never been something you absolutely needed to have for something anyways.,thegoaliebear,1
made gambit sooo fun,Buttkikker,1
The gun I really want is Luna's Howl,RonInDune,1
no definitely optional but good none the less,Buttkikker,1
if I have any opportunity to *not* play crucible then I will.,thegoaliebear,1
very fair,Buttkikker,1
I likely wouldn't have gotten recluse if I didn't get hella lucky with the lfg group I found.,thegoaliebear,1
"Also, despite the nerf Recluse still feels pretty god honestly",RonInDune,1
Though I haven't been using it as much,RonInDune,1
ive always solo queued for everything because i had noone to play with before this clan,Buttkikker,1
"yeah, it is.",thegoaliebear,1
for comp that is,Buttkikker,1
can't say the nerf really decreased its value. thing still shreds aha.,thegoaliebear,1
just needs aim now so that OEM recluse is gone,Buttkikker,1
OEM...🙄🙄🙄,thegoaliebear,1
and just...any combination in a build that can give you instant health is stupid.,thegoaliebear,1
the hunter builds are even more annoying bc you don't even have to get a kill to get health regen.,thegoaliebear,1
it's all annoying actually lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
ez,Buttkikker,1
That gun looks like it came from the Robocop universe,RonInDune,1
now the question is should i go for python or enter arbalest the experience tm,Buttkikker,1
Wait a week or for the Arbalest Time ™️,RonInDune,1
That's when I'll try,RonInDune,1
well im probably going to get all the rituals this week,Buttkikker,1
ah,RonInDune,1
there simple enough that i feel its reasonable,Buttkikker,1
for me that is ive got lots of time,Buttkikker,1
literally everyone is using arbalest in PvP now. so...it's not a terrible time to get it over with haha.,thegoaliebear,1
lol now to choose between my 22 shottys in the vault,Buttkikker,1
I'm just happy to grind out strikes now haha.,thegoaliebear,1
even gambit I can deal with over PvP.,thegoaliebear,1
@Buttkikker you having issues with the gambit servers?,Crizum,1
"It keeps finding a person, going to load in, and dropping back to 7/8 searching",Crizum,1
no ive not had any issues,Buttkikker,1
are you doing prime or regular?,Buttkikker,1
im doing regular,Buttkikker,1
I was trying regular but I had to go to prime to actually load in,Crizum,1
odd,Buttkikker,1
id be happy to queue in with you after this game,Buttkikker,1

"Should I make a new server, or just invite my friend into this server?",Infernosi,1

They also have decent mods attached to them,Crizum,1
@Infernosi invite them here that's fine.,thegoaliebear,1
"The more you upgrade, along with season pass levels, the quicker it is to farm rolls on the saint-14 weapons, some of which are pretty good",Crizum,1
yeah it seemed like those obelisk things were the focus. I just wish it didn't take so damn much to level them lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"yeah, there four planets and each one maxes out at 11",Crizum,1
damn.,thegoaliebear,1
"Ok, we're in raid - alpha channel",Infernosi,1
So it's 200 of the materials per level times 4,Crizum,1
what is the quickest way to farm those things.,thegoaliebear,1
Some of them when you level up you get extra drops in whatever activity,Crizum,1
"The weekly bounties get you 100 each, triumphs you some and you get more per level of the triumph",Crizum,1

"@thegoaliebear If we want to get a 6th from lfg, what do we do?",Infernosi,1

Will ODST be a part of the MCC?,RonInDune,1
It is yeah,Crizum,1
Nice! I've heard good things about that one,RonInDune,1
It’ll be last on pc since they are doing chronological order,Crizum,1

Reach is the first game in the series in chronological order,Oathbreaker,1
"Also, playing Heroic?",Crizum,1
I believe Bungies line was always about Heroic being their intended difficulty,Crizum,1
Or the baseline they adjusted up and down from,Crizum,1

Oh no I'm on Normal now lol,RonInDune,1

hmm,RonInDune,1
"Pistol in Halo 1, battle rifle in Halo 2 and 3",LW Mugetsu,1
"Oath can probably elaborate better than I can, but fundamentally Halo pvp was about map and weapon control, and AR starts meant you would pick up more of what was placed on the map weapon wise",Crizum,1
"You’d control weapon spawns as they were on a timer, and a good team would always wreck once you got rolling",Crizum,1
"Yeah I played a couple of rounds of the mode that was sniper only, no radar and the birthday sounds everytime you headshot",RonInDune,1
I had a blast!,RonInDune,1
Battle rifle was a 4 shot headshot,LW Mugetsu,1
"DMR’s, and previously BR’s are multi-purpose weapons, they weren’t too OP but they allowed skilled players to have a chance against people with more powerful weapons",Crizum,1
Battle rifle isn't in reach at all right?,RonInDune,1
Is it like a pulse?,RonInDune,1

Maybe?,Trissin,1
Either that or ||the kinetic fusion rifle||,Crizum,1
||wait that's going to be kinetic????||,Trissin,1
"I believe so, may be remembering wrong but someone data mined something",Crizum,1
||there's are some places that show the hidden triumphs and none of them are trials||,Arixama,1
||also yes it kinetic||,Arixama,1
"|| This exotic fusion rifle has the unique perk Saint’s Fists, which allows the weapon to be charged to fire three spreads of kinetic slugs. It also contains the perk Breakthrough, which allows it to partially bypass enemies’ elemental shields.||",Crizum,1

Its what Osiris is doing,Crizum,1

he just wanted his mans back😩,thegoaliebear,1
"Honestly, I didn't expect Saint XIV to be so wholesome, but I love him",Peronix,1
when I first walked up to him he was feeding his pigeons and I was just like...I love this man.,thegoaliebear,1
I guess if you go up to him wearing the helm of saint-14 he laughs and says you and him should go confuse Zavala,Crizum,1
"Saint-14: 
Me:",thegoaliebear,1
I can't imagine Bungie would take him away at the end of the season,Peronix,1
they better not.,thegoaliebear,1
"Turns out Destiny was a sci-Fi soap opera this whole time, and the current Saint XIV is actually the ***evil*** version, Saint 41.

"At the end of the season, Saint 41 will be put down, but Osiris’ grip on Mercury will stay tightened, since we killed the only opposition: the Flayers.

Out of options, the Vanguard turn to their last resort: Colonel",Peronix,1

They're the same for everyone. What time were you thinking?,Peronix,1
"8-9 hours from now would work for me
i get home ~3pm EST from work but i can play the whole evening considering it is weekend",sasch,1
@Peronix @Crizum @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 @RonInDune @LW Mugetsu so did we want to try a flawless run tonight? I'm totally good with waiting more if needed. but I'd be free tonight too.,thegoaliebear,1
"I shouldn't have anything come up tonight, so I'm down",Peronix,1
cool. I should be able to get on around 9 EST. but it seemed like everyone else was available for it too.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm down,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Yeah I'm free today as well,RonInDune,1
"I guess we should say Im up, no more guardian down ;)",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
*it echoes*,Peronix,1
"*In the back of my mind, paranoia festers, reminding me of those damn words*",Peronix,1
"""Guardian down""",Peronix,1
Tonight I'll have coffee earlier so it kicks in before I die 20 times in the second encounter lmao,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Bungie, let us skip the third encounter pls",Peronix,1
Yesterday was messy af,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Third encounter mostly?,Peronix,1
Nah for some reason second was rough and we werent trying anything lmao,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Or im confused idk,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Ah. I'm gonna have to watch the turmoil,Peronix,1
also the game didn't like Ron either lol.,thegoaliebear,1
RIP. What did the game curse Ron with?,Peronix,1
just connection stuff and lots of error codes.,thegoaliebear,1
so...it was a good thing we didn't legit go for flawless last night aha.,thegoaliebear,1
hopefully it's better tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
*knocks on wood*,Peronix,1
I kept getting anteater-ed and weasel-ed,RonInDune,1
I kept playing iron banner and stuff the rest of the night with no issues,RonInDune,1
If only Destiny’s servers were as solid as iron,Peronix,1
Yeah I’m good for tonight,Crizum,1
"Not with that Cats picture, you aren’t",Peronix,1
idk when but I'm gonna be getting 2700X haha. whenever the next time I can get to Cleveland is😂,thegoaliebear,1
"Anyone feeling for some Crucible / Weekly Clan bounties? (gambit, raid, crucible, nightfall: the ordeal)",sasch,1
my dog will bring us good fortune for tonight. we cannot fail him.,thegoaliebear,1
My dog will probably just bark at the worst possible time like always,Crizum,1
"his face... ""I'm gonna do it""",thegoaliebear,1

Works for me,LW Mugetsu,1
I'm ready whenever,RonInDune,1
join us.,thegoaliebear,1
hey sorry but i need 10 more minutes,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
no worries.,thegoaliebear,1
@Arixama @Trissin either of you maybe available to help with a flawless if Ron keeps having connection issues.,thegoaliebear,1
"I might be able to a bit later, not sure atm",Trissin,1
okay. we are giving it one more shot then. just let us know.,thegoaliebear,1
good luck!! Hope you get it!,Trissin,1
@Trissin stay on standby please 😂,thegoaliebear,1
oh no,Trissin,1
Alright @Trissin you can come in,RonInDune,1
oh noooo,Trissin,1
:((,Trissin,1
I'm not sure it's a good idea for me to try for flawless tonight tbh,Trissin,1
Because I am a bit tired and it is a little late to start attempts now,Trissin,1
We can one shot,Crizum,1
Pros,Crizum,1
yeah?,Trissin,1
Cons - we might die,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"We keep getting to the final boss, Ron is just disconnecting at poor times",Crizum,1
Oh no :(((,Trissin,1
One phased the third encounter,Crizum,1
give me one min,Trissin,1
!lfg create,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune ^ we are giving it another go next Thursday if you want to suffer again.,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't know how much I'll be playing over the next month or so, so @Trissin is welcome to take my place",RonInDune,1
alright.,thegoaliebear,1
"are we running tuesday or thursday? because I cant do tuesday this time, we would start literally 11:30pm in new years eve",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I believe we decided Thursday,Peronix,1
family would kill me before the adds,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
thursday it's fine to me,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah it's thursday. warmind just hasn't updated for the new year so I can't put in January dates yet.,thegoaliebear,1
shoot fireworks at the boss :4Head:,sasch,1
"I was checking the footage of our last run and we deposited 39 motes and still wasnt enough, so I guess it starts with 10 as crizum said and we lost all of them",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
it was 14+15+10,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I don't see how tho...because only one goblin sacrificed right?,thegoaliebear,1
"no, it was like 3 of them",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
that's shitty. whatever. hopefully some time away from it helps us.,thegoaliebear,1
"yep, we're super close to get it",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
we'll get it. raid isn't going anywhere.,thegoaliebear,1
yeah,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Anyone down to help farm the Castellum twice to help me get the last two seals for Acrius?,Peronix,1
I won't be on until the evening.,thegoaliebear,1
"That's cool! If you're down with doing it, I can wait till this evening",Peronix,1
yeah I can help👍,thegoaliebear,1
I think I found my next dog😩😍😭😭😭,thegoaliebear,1
ngl thought that was a hammer and sickle background at first glance,Peronix,1
anyone for some crucible games?,sasch,1
@Peronix won't be on tonight sorry. not feeling too great gonna hit the sack pretty early aha.,thegoaliebear,1
It's all good! I'm about in the same boat,Peronix,1
hah yeah. i gotta catch up on sleep a lot.,thegoaliebear,1
So I guess if we use the new mods we can consistently one phase the third encounter. We should use taking charge which gives buff when pick up orbs (well and bubble give free orbs) and high-energy fire for 20% dmg buff. Buff lasts until an enemy is killed so it will be applied the entire damage phase,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I want to one-phase the raid,Peronix,1
I want to shoot the raid with Izanagis,Peronix,1
mood,Trissin,1
we'll get it on thursday.,thegoaliebear,1
using those seasonal mods should help a lot then.,thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah I can get those set up, would also help for those who don't have gear that can have relay defender",Crizum,1
yeah. idk how much that would affect me since I'm on Divinity?,thegoaliebear,1
With how little the boss usually has if we need a second phase it should make it an easy one phase,Crizum,1
"yeah that's what I thought, we'll probably get one phase more consistently",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
nice. I'll make sure I have that mod set up for Thursday then.,thegoaliebear,1
I forget which obelisk it is,Crizum,1
I'm not sure...but I know I took it haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"I belive it's from the first two obelisks, one from each",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
i guess it only helps in this specific encounter tbh and maybe final boss if someone can't stack 4-5 enhanced relay,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"each enhanced relay apparently gives 10% buff, so 3 enhanced + new ones you can get the same total buff",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"useful if you run one exotic like nighthawk, luna...",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah. maybe I could run nighthawk.,thegoaliebear,1
*do it for the ornament*,Peronix,1
i can run nighthawk too but invisibility it's such a great get out of the jail card,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah the tether helps me a lot in the third encounter as well. but i'll give nighthawk a go this time around. if it means me one phase then i'd rather that haha.,thegoaliebear,1

i think it's mainly because when there are more encounters to a raid it feels like such a drag and it's so draining.,thegoaliebear,1
but taking a break from it was good tbh.,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune definitely don't give up. The only reason you don't have it already is because destiny dealt you an awful hand of disconnects. You got this.,Arixama,1
^^ that's true. i strongly believe we would have gotten it by now if it weren't for the disconnects. but it happens...we'll get it soon enough. the raid isn't going anywhere aha.,thegoaliebear,1

i need someone to explain to me how in the fuck you lose 44 motes in a single gambit game,Kimarais/Nick,1
im shocked,Kimarais/Nick,1
bamboozled even,Kimarais/Nick,1
*yikes*,thegoaliebear,1
Seen much worse...,flipd,1
*yikes intensifies*,thegoaliebear,1
i cant even imagine worse,Kimarais/Nick,1
that cant be possible,Kimarais/Nick,1
thats two games worth of motes,flipd,1
lol,Kimarais/Nick,1
Probably klaybar,Crizum,1
Other question is how did your invader get 19 guardian kills and only deny 25,Crizum,1
he had like 12 kills in damage phase,Kimarais/Nick,1
The 158 lost had to be on purpose I refuse to believe that haha,Crizum,1
like he wiped them three times in dps phase,Kimarais/Nick,1
only 19 kills because that was me and i could only invade after their primeval spawned,flipd,1
we could never get enough motes to open the portal because of these two bozos,flipd,1
Also what were you fighting?,Crizum,1
Fighting my own team i guess,flipd,1

dang that pain I felt it,Xanados,1

i am on rn if people wanna grind that out together.,thegoaliebear,1

oooh good idea that,RonInDune,1
You’ll be done with kills long before you’re done with rank,Crizum,1

lol legend sundial it's pretty much like the normal one in the sense that you can run out of time in every single encounter and still progress... smh,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
it's only 950 too. I don't think they intended it to be super challenging.,thegoaliebear,1
at least it's a solid way of pinnacle for the heavy slot,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
for sure. looking forward to running it tonight.,thegoaliebear,1
i did a lfg run,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
like they added match game and some enemies have shields but at the same time if you dont need to actually complete any enounter besides boss fight it's kinda lame,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
ok Legend Sundial is fairly simple,RonInDune,1

What is?,Arixama,1
||Osiris lets you into the COrridors of Time|| indefinitely,RonInDune,1
so to my understanding in Escape from Tarkov you get to keep anything you find on Scav runs long as you extract or survive and can still do quests that way?,thegoaliebear,1
Ye,Peronix,1
that's sweet. I gotta do those😂,thegoaliebear,1
ok it's a massive new puzzle,RonInDune,1
all the symbols are up and we need to figure a path through the maze,RonInDune,1
what is this even for.,thegoaliebear,1
who even knows at this point,RonInDune,1
"I found a ""reset"" button but I can't find it anymore lol",RonInDune,1
all I know is that next tuesday is the bastion quest lol.,thegoaliebear,1
ok these mission impossible lasers are real freaking annoying,RonInDune,1
wish I was on a hunter,RonInDune,1
"no, i think bastion its on 28th",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Has anyone tried following the pattern of the symbols from both part 1 and part 2?,Peronix,1
dunno I'm going random for now,RonInDune,1
oh wow that's even further away than I thought  haha @Sarsante - 76561197967628966,thegoaliebear,1
I think I'll follow the symbols from the planets then,RonInDune,1
"ok if you go in the wrong thing, you get a reset",RonInDune,1
I highly doubt this is needed for the title or anything important but if it is lmk lol.,thegoaliebear,1
||It's probably for that datamined exotic rocket launcher||,Peronix,1

~~beat the reddit nerds~~,thegoaliebear,1

there's a new quest? i didnt even notice it,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
apparently. seems like it's only for lore.,thegoaliebear,1
we accidentally solved another one,RonInDune,1
now we don't remember the path,RonInDune,1
"What if you had to remember the path to get out, and if you didn’t, your character would be locked (trapped in time)",Peronix,1
now that would be cool haha.,thegoaliebear,1
we're breaking out the ol' pen and paper strats,RonInDune,1

"So, ||does this look like any particular D1 weapon?||",RonInDune,1
"||hmm.... Looks to be a modified version of the OG swords from the Taken king that eventually got turned into Raze-Lighter, Dark Drinker, and Bolt-Caster||",Oathbreaker,1
ooooh,RonInDune,1
"||If I remember correctly, those swords were curved blade and not straight blade though||",Oathbreaker,1
booo,RonInDune,1
these corridors are confusing lol,AhRealMonsters,1
"They are, but once you know where the correct path is, you can just run straight through",RonInDune,1
||CORRECTION: Straight blade in D1. Exotic swords were curved.||,Oathbreaker,1
hmmm,RonInDune,1
im just sayin,Arixama,1
||An odd choice for a grave marker though..... Only ourselves and Shaxx were involved in the making of those from what I remember||,Oathbreaker,1
||Return to the Dreadnaught confirmed||,RonInDune,1
Thanks Valve,RonInDune,1
"||And if it was meant to be Shaxx's grave, he's got far more iconic things, like the sigil of the Crucible, or his helmet, etc.||",Oathbreaker,1
"||There are 19 pieces of lore, so this might go on for 19 hours|| btw",RonInDune,1
||could be *OUR* grave||,Arixama,1
** *oooooooooh* **,RonInDune,1
||This is weird. I don't know who's grave it is intended to be||,Oathbreaker,1
||Praedyth?||,RonInDune,1
"||We also have more iconic weapons or ways of marking our grave. Those swords.... They weren't used from day 1 of D1, they weren't really *OUR* weapon because Shaxx fucking yoinked our damn Raze Lighter the bastard||",Oathbreaker,1
loool,RonInDune,1
||Praedyth's grave is in the Vault. He was present in the sealed chamber in the Gorgon's Lair where the materials chest is present||,Oathbreaker,1
ahh,RonInDune,1
||Serously I can't think of anyone important who that could be.||,RonInDune,1
||Maybe the people mentioned in the GoS armour lore??||,RonInDune,1
"||The only other person who had a hand in the creation of a sword was Eris Morn, who took the initial shard of Willbreaker||",Oathbreaker,1
||Thought the Kentarch-3 killed each other in the Garden?||,Oathbreaker,1
||Wasn’t that emblem thing in the OG tower or no?||,Crizum,1
||Thought it was the Vanguard Emblem||,RonInDune,1
"Anyway, there is some leaked audio with massive spoilers ||that points to Saint holding a vigil for our character, believing us to be lost in time but able to somehow pull our way out, whereas everyone else believes us gone|| <-massive spoilers don’t get mad if you click",Crizum,1
||Absolutely was the Vanguard Emblem||,Oathbreaker,1
@Crizum  ||yes! I high key love that idea of our Guardians getting lost and hope it gets turned into something more.||,thegoaliebear,1
frick I should not have clicked that,RonInDune,1
"cant get mad ron, you did this to yourself :goal_finger_gun:",Arixama,1

"I love the idea that ||Saint being around is messing with the timeline too much, and now a choice must be made. Saint-XIV or us? Saint obviously makes the choice for us||",Crizum,1
"||Vex logic would be without us there is no saint, go back and put everything in to one last ditch effort to erase us, eventually we end the vex threat completely and wipe a player off the board for Destiny 3, we don’t even touch Savathun until D3, the rest of 2 is us uniting the fallen and defeating the vex, an uneasy alliance with the cabal and a massive war against the darkness and hive|| but would Bungo even try that?",Crizum,1
That's honestly way too ambitious for Bungo,RonInDune,1
||my SIVA obsessed guardian loves that idea lmao. I would really love to see a story line where we ally with another enemy race.|| but yeah that is too much for bungie to handle haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"||Ron, the Kentarch 3 are likely dead. Current running theory is Yardarm-4 and Rekkana were killed by Lisbon, after all three were ""turned"" by the Darkness, Lisbon changed his mind, started a fight with other two. Uses Divinity to kill the other two, leaving no bodies. He's the last one standing, *potentially* gets turned into a Vex along with his Ghost, becoming the Sanctified Mind and the Consecrated Mind respectively||",Oathbreaker,1

You could grind whatever you like but not no life yourself to the cap in a day,Crizum,1
You can currently get like 7 pinnacles a week yes?,Crizum,1
5 in Garden (counting weekly challenge) 1 in pit 1 in legend sundial?,Crizum,1
yeah i think all raids should still drop pinnacle gear.,thegoaliebear,1
"Could be nice to still cap you at 7 pinnacles, but allow you to earn them in any raid, and maybe even the competitive playlist?",Crizum,1
for sure.,thegoaliebear,1
talking about pinnacles I feel only 10 level increase each 3 months is not enough to keep us busy for 3 months. when shadowkeep was released there was more levels tro grind before the pinnacles. this season most started at 960 or pretty close to that,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

I mean Ill never complain about more fire emblem characters,Trissin,1

Which is fair absolutely,Trissin,1

also what weapon is that,RonInDune,1
in the first pic,RonInDune,1
that was an encoded message in D1 from one of the crucible maps on Venus,Oathbreaker,1
people were super excited about it for a while then it fell off because of some other secrets iirc combined with it only being a message,Oathbreaker,1
interesting,RonInDune,1
"as for the fusion rifle.... quite a few different ones held that model from what I remember. 77 Wizard, LIGHT/BEWARE are just a few examples of that specific base model",Oathbreaker,1
ah i didn't realize it was a fusion,RonInDune,1
Guns were also not fixed element at that point so it literally could have been any of the models with an Arc roll,Oathbreaker,1
like D2 Y1,RonInDune,1
off the top of my head,Oathbreaker,1
that could have been Plan C,Oathbreaker,1
"not plan C, sights were different",Oathbreaker,1
Plan C was still Arc,Jeremy,1
Definitely not it,Jeremy,1
Oh shit that was arc,Jeremy,1
Uhhhh,Jeremy,1
It honestly looks like a LIGHT/BEWARE or 77 Wizard model,Oathbreaker,1
Because both had that side venting,Oathbreaker,1

Infinite Warfare?,Peronix,1
Ah,RonInDune,1
I think,Peronix,1
Might get that one if it's cheap,RonInDune,1
I got confused between infinite warfare and advanced warfare and was really confused for a second there,Trissin,1
"And Ron MK8 is on the wiiu and switch, and I think it was pretty close to launch",Crizum,1
It’s probably above breath of the wild thanks to the extra units the wiiu sold,Crizum,1
Huh it's one of those games that's not on my radar so I think it's not that big,RonInDune,1
plus Mario Kart has more accessibility due to it being a good “party” game and having simple gameplay,Peronix,1
Surprised Minecraft is only 10,Crizum,1
Also wasn't battlefield 1 a flop?,RonInDune,1
Battlefield 1 and Battlefront were both viewed as flops by the larger community iirc,Crizum,1
"Due to the backlash from the loot boxes,  but obviously gamers are fucking stupid and don’t actually care seeing how much cod is on that list",Crizum,1
I would actually be interested in the statistics for Mario kart 8 and destiny,Arixama,1
"Like are they calling the switch version Mario kart 8, or did they smash deluxe and Wii u versions together",Arixama,1
Is it destiny as a franchise or just destiny 1? Are they including sales of dlcs for Destiny 1 in there or just base game copies?,Arixama,1
yeah true. would be interesting to know.,thegoaliebear,1
"Like they obviously seperated all the call of duty games out, but was that just to pad the list or what?",Arixama,1
"I think sales of dlc counts towards that game, and I’d assume they count various versions",Crizum,1
"Destiny would be the odd case of counting as a franchise, but it may just be D1",Crizum,1
"And I don’t think it was to pd the list ari, cod just sells so much",Crizum,1
"That's why I'm curious about it. With out knowing the actual parameters, ""best selling game"" is so vague.",Arixama,1
"Is gta v only the best selling game because it has 6 different levels of purchasable in game currency listed as dlcs, or are we talking about base gtav selling a bunch of copies across all the platforms its on?",Arixama,1
I just want to know what the qualifiers are 😭,Arixama,1
"Assume that it counts sales of the base game, goty editions, and larger scale dlc but not in game purchases",Crizum,1
"So shark cards wouldn’t count, but the dlc heists would?",Crizum,1
"It’s either that or base units, i don’t think in-game micro transactions count otherwise it’d be top grossing and not top selling",Crizum,1
"If that's the case, then gtav being the top slot is insanely impressive, because all of their actual in game content is free",Arixama,1
So they're revenue comes from base game sales and shark cards,Arixama,1
"No idea, it’s all sales which are a bunch of made up numbers you can mess with to say whatever you want",Crizum,1
Man I should get GTA V one of these days just to see what the hype is about,RonInDune,1
Didn't they put out a Casino DLC recently?,RonInDune,1
It’s like when you see “The number 1 comedy in America two weeks in a row!” Okay it was the only comedy and it made like 20 million total but go off,Crizum,1
So I’m pretty sure cod Minecraft and Fortnite all get to say “top franchise of the X”,Crizum,1
GTA can be a lot of fun but can also be really frustrating at times,Trissin,1
I'm surprized none of the Blizzard games are up there,RonInDune,1
OVerwatch/WoW/Starcraft/HoTs,RonInDune,1
Or any of the EA sports stuff,RonInDune,1

I didn't really expect StarCraft to be on there unfortunately but Overwatch is huge,Trissin,1
"Oh man is Starcraft dead thes days? I though it was the biggest Eport ever, till Fortnite/plunkbat/Dota etc.",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, it's not nearly as big anymore :((",Trissin,1

I never read a piece of lore on Ishtar archive or whatever  until I've unlocked it ingame,RonInDune,1

yeah agreed,RonInDune,1
They set their own expectations lol,Crizum,1
"Like the actual problem is that people were expecting something that hadn't been announced, and started making wild guessed about what it was 🤷‍♂️",Arixama,1
I want see Glad's face when he realized it was a Bastion step,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I quite like the gun so far,RonInDune,1
Would have been hilarious though if they gave up and didn’t do the puzzle,Crizum,1
And we just didn’t get bastion this season,Crizum,1
^,Arixama,1
Hilarious as shit if it requires all that work and is just a PvP shredder,Crizum,1
lmaooo,thegoaliebear,1
I feel if people didnt break the puzzle they would make like same amount of rooms than it's for the emblem and quest wouls drop anyways at 28th,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
It *is* a PvP shredder,RonInDune,1
@Arixama oh I agree. people set their expectations way too high with a lot of things lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"I mean a quest like that on a grander scale than say Whisper or Outbreak to lead to a gun promised on the roadmap is kinda dumb imo. My understanding is that the quest would have been given out on the 28th, and yeah, this is cool to unlock it early but something that takes 5 days and people staying up for days to complete a puzzle for something we were already gonna get.... I dunno. Doesn't sit well with me. I respect other people's opinions though",Oathbreaker,1
We weren't going to get it if the puzzle didn't get done,Arixama,1
"Bungie tweeted its on the roadmap to let people know it’s coming, but apparently wasn’t set to drop on the 28th, just whenever the puzzle was finished this season",Crizum,1
Okay.... So then IMO it should have been advertised as such,Oathbreaker,1
If they didn’t roadmap it people would have data mined it anyway which I guess saves some surprise for some people,Crizum,1
Nah they would drop it anyways because of consumer policy.,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
maybe by the end of the season instead of 28th,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Idk, if they tell you the reward for the puzzle there’s less incentive to figure it all out right?",Crizum,1
It'd be Niobe Labs - Bergusia forge situation once again,RonInDune,1
^^ probably yeah haha,thegoaliebear,1
it was fun tho... to see a bunch of people very commited,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
now we have a ton of salt on reddit,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

I don’t feel one ounce of sympathy,Crizum,1
^,Arixama,1
"But at the same time, the initial roadmap made it seem like it was coming out on the 28th and this was unrelated. I don't think it's a great idea to mask it like that but like... That was their call.

As for it being a PvP ""shredder"" it's a shotgun that's hitscan and has charge up that occupies the kinetic slot, so you can't run Spare, Ace, Thorn, TLW, or other kinetic primaries and means you're looking at using energy primaries which don't have a lot of good choices for PvP in comparison to kinetic slot primaries.",Oathbreaker,1
"Dudes gonna make around 75k in payouts this month because Bungie put out a puzzle, so he can miss me with that “this was underwhelming” shit",Crizum,1

"Sorry, I don't agree with that take Crizum.",Oathbreaker,1
I think a lot of the times streamers set the tone,Crizum,1
The streamers got a bunch of sub and the raid secrets community grew about 25 times its size from a single event,Arixama,1

"I watched some Datto say one and he was seriously moaning “I had *SO* much to do today, *sooooo* much”",Crizum,1
"You chose this as your job, Destiny isn’t on the level of Fortnite, go take a break if it’s getting so toxic",Crizum,1
"It’s been what, 6 days?",Crizum,1
You making 75k in six days playing a video game and your gonna tell me “yeah but it was a waste of my time”,Crizum,1
How’s that not sound entitled?,Crizum,1
Money is never enough,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"it is entitled. at least for me, I just mean in terms of people who don't do it as their job. there were a lot of community members putting in their time for it, so I just felt kinda bad for them haha.",thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I can get that,Crizum,1
"But like, Ron was involved and no offense @RonInDune but if he tweets out “that puzzle kinda sucked lol” it isn’t the same as a Datto/Sweatcicle doing it",Crizum,1
"Okay. So the ""you do this as a job"" argument is frustrating to me because yeah, it's their job, so if they're frustrated with the state of the game and they spend this much time on something that is on a grander scale than that of previous hidden quests for something that we expected as a standalone quest, not related to this at all, why shouldn't they be frustrated and annoyed at the amount of effort relating to payoff *in terms of the puzzle*. Yes, Gladd got a shitton of subs. Yeah, he's gonna be making bank but him and the other people involved can say that it sucked. It took them days to solve it, requiring 5000 unique puzzle pieces that could be duplicated often by unique players, they were expecting some secretive reward instead of something that was already promised.",Oathbreaker,1
"That's just my take on it, I respect your opinions, I just don't really agree.",Oathbreaker,1
"And I mean that’s fine, perhaps it’ll always be a generational thing when it comes to streamers playing games as a job",Crizum,1
"I’ll agree that it would have been cool if Bungie didn’t have bastion on the road map, but even if they didn’t it would have been data mined to all hell and we’d likely have the same end result",Crizum,1
"Speaking of data-mining, isn't there an ||exotic rocket launcher|| that was data-mined? I know people thought *that* would've been the reward",Peronix,1
There’s apparently a ||returning solar rocket launcher|| referred to by some sting of text in the ||catalysts||,Crizum,1
So would it have been better if at the end of it everyone was gifted ||Dragon’s Breath||?,Crizum,1

"People were literally streaming for days pushing themselves to exhaustion, and as far as I've heard some streamers were refusing to attempt progress unless people were subbing, so forgive me if I'm a little bit jaded about streamers complainong the payoff wasn't worth it",Arixama,1
Okay but those streamers are assholes plain and simple,Oathbreaker,1
My thoughts on this :PepeAnnoyed: :,AhRealMonsters,1
Lol,Crizum,1
raidsecrets bringing their a game in complaints,Crizum,1
"|| This is nitpicky but Saint-14 describes the ""mystery weapon"" as our favorite gun. OUR FAVORITE GUN.

"Some SPICY takes in the Destiny subreddit today, dear lord.",Peronix,1
Imagine thinking Activision is a good company,Peronix,1
Imagine thinking this puzzle situation is anything like eververse,Crizum,1
I think Bungie is seriously missing Vicarious Visions,RonInDune,1
They're the one who designed most of the Dreaming City and Black Armoury stuff didn't they?,RonInDune,1
Plus the Warmind/Rise of Iron aesthetic,RonInDune,1
That's why the loss of Activision hit them hard,RonInDune,1
"Honestly they are a what, 700 person team? It shouldn’t have hit them as hard as it did assuming they actually have people working on D2",Crizum,1
They are working on another IP too,Infernosi,1
"That’s fair, but we aren’t playing that other ip haha",Crizum,1
"okay but Vicarious Visions, High Moon Studios, and the other supplementary studios Activision had allowed them to create more content with less of an issue",Oathbreaker,1
"VV was some 250-ish people, plus they also lost High Moon",RonInDune,1
THat's more than a quarter of their total lost,RonInDune,1
Criz.... a new IP takes a lot of resources for studios. Just because we're playing Destiny and not whatever else they're cooking up doesn't mean it's not a resource drain,Oathbreaker,1
this is an interesting topic,sasch,1
"because looking at bungie's office, it looks HORRIBLE for productivity",sasch,1
"No my point is that that other IP is taking resources away from D2, but if it’s leaving D2 in the current limbo where nobody seems happy that’s 100% on Bungie",Crizum,1
"ah, fair.",Oathbreaker,1
They have their eye on the future and I understand that,Crizum,1
yeah fully agreed,RonInDune,1
But that’s the choice they made,Crizum,1
Until that IP is in our hands it means literally nothing to me,Crizum,1
See all they need to do to get back to their best is make a sequel to Oni,RonInDune,1
The greatest game ever made,RonInDune,1
"Because to me Destiny traded on the promise from Halo, and Destiny 2 traded on the promise of what D1 was able to become, but I don’t know how much more I’m willing to trade on the promises when D2 is what it is you know?",Crizum,1
would people who made Oni still work at bungie,sasch,1
"I still like the game, I’ll play whatever they have, but they’ve lost some luster for me is all",Crizum,1
I just wish they would let us know what the thought process behind some of their decisions,Oathbreaker,1
They want to become a publisher,Crizum,1
"""30 seconds of fun stretched to a whole game""",RonInDune,1
that was a good philosophy to live by,RonInDune,1
dunno if it's true anymore,RonInDune,1
"Because Destiny is really losing steam for me. I don't touch it nearly as much these days. I want to know why they thought changing X to A, and Y to Z, or leaving something alone from a balancing perspective and then yeeting something else into the void of ""this sucks now"" a few days after it gets a buff, or other WTF moments in recent months",Oathbreaker,1
"yeah the only thing I'll do these days is just enough gambit to get the season title, and practice PvP to get Lunas someday",RonInDune,1
"Just, if they show off their new game at some point in the next two years and you hear the words “core gameplay” “return to basics” “our history of X” take a shot ok",Crizum,1
"I don't even play PvP anymore. SBMM sucks the fun out of it for the most part, and I don't care to get Unbroken because these days according to a lot of people, Unbrokens are just automatically shitbags and treat people like ass (sentiments from other servers I'm in)",Oathbreaker,1
They’ve almost listened to the community too much I think haha,Crizum,1
"I mean on the other end of the spectrum, they've not listened to us before and that's resulted in the community being just as pissed off",Oathbreaker,1
"I guess the better phrasing is, they listened but they didn’t hear",Crizum,1
"Bungie can't seem to balance anything, be it Crucible, community expectations for a puzzle, whether the should or shouldn't listen to the community, which parts of the community to cater to, etc. (Kind of joking)",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah I can agree with that,Oathbreaker,1
"I'd argue that overall Bungie has improved on those points, yet the areas Bungie falters in only make things worse because of those steps forward.",Infernosi,1
"I mean personally speaking.... Crucible is relatively unfun for me these days when i do play. Some things are overtuned and have been left alone, other things should be retuned to make them better but haven't, HC archetypes are all the same in terms of drawbacks other than fire rate, so why not pick 150s because the other 3 don't really offer any reason to use them. Then there's things like the artifact mods, or the new seasonal mods that allow for some weird shit to go on in PvP. I don't like the battery mods. The solar Thundercoil equivalent is frustrating. It just goes on and on.

The Crucible improved from Y1 to Y2. I'd argue that it's almost only stagnated from about Black Armory on.",Oathbreaker,1
That's just speaking for Crucible though.,Oathbreaker,1
I will say that I quite enjoy most of the new content that Bungie has put out in recent months.... it's just that other things are really being exposed as lackluster,Oathbreaker,1
Maybe I'm just burnt out and too cynical about it at this point. I don't really know.,Oathbreaker,1
Best thing to do is probably an extended break?,Crizum,1
honestly yeah,RonInDune,1
The game is more fun for me when I take time off and play something else for a bit,Crizum,1
Maybe try this excellent new looter-shooter game:,RonInDune,1
* **Anthem** *,RonInDune,1
I have been taking a break. Lately been getting on just to do a few things. Mostly bounties.,Oathbreaker,1
"Even with that, it can start to feel like a chore",Crizum,1
"I want to hit 100 for the seasons because I made the mistake of getting the deluxe edition of Shadowkeep, meaning I want to hit 100 for the next two seasons, including this one",Oathbreaker,1
Oh it does,Oathbreaker,1
Oh yeah haha I can feel that,Crizum,1
That doesn't really burn me out because I can work on other shit during bounty hell as I've come to call it,Oathbreaker,1
That's ones of the biggest things I'm dreading.,Infernosi,1
I’m only 100+ because it took some time in between jobs for me to find something,Crizum,1
"I tend to forget to grab bounties when doing things, so going out of my way and getting that done can just be frustrating.",Infernosi,1
Once that’s over I doubt I’ll have the desire to bang out 100 levels,Crizum,1
I do the extra boring strat of doing an eternity's worth of Eris bounties.,Oathbreaker,1
"Do that with a podcast or Spotify on in the background, that was my method",Crizum,1
I should probably do that.,Infernosi,1
"Also, Bastion is crazy fun to use in pvp.",Infernosi,1
"Oh I do, usually work on calculus or something else, otherwise my brain just shuts off entirely.",Oathbreaker,1
Brain shut off is my goal haha,Crizum,1
Kill a few hours without it feeling like an eternity,Crizum,1
"That being said, integral calculus makes my fucking brain hurt because it's *too far fucking backwards from what I know about calculus*",Oathbreaker,1

There's some dope Hunter looks this season ngl,RonInDune,1
(from https://twitter.com/KobOneArt/status/1219708127366590465),RonInDune,1
This is what I've been rocking if I want to look all fancy on my Hunter,Oathbreaker,1
ooooh,RonInDune,1
smooth,RonInDune,1
very high fashion Indiana Jones there,RonInDune,1
Just not so happy with the chest armor but it's the closest fit so,Oathbreaker,1
"hmm, maybe last season's Iron Banner?",RonInDune,1
Don't have a good roll on it (this armor is also functioning as my shotgunning set of gear),Oathbreaker,1
ah,RonInDune,1
"When grinding for Python I had a full shotgun loadout with double shotgun mods on every piece, but I looked horrifying and got sniped by invaders constantly",RonInDune,1
I had a big back pack that strike.,LW Mugetsu,1
woah,RonInDune,1
is anyone up for IB tonight?,Thawxtem,1
thats a really big backpack,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yeah. graviton lance and the resulting explosion cause more and more. I ends up being just one big group of explosions and that's how you end up with those stupidly high numbers,LW Mugetsu,1
for anyone who hasn't gotten the bastion any of the wanted spider bounties count towards it's completion,LW Mugetsu,1
whats the best way to grind to season rank 100?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"turn in weekly bounties while teamed up, as well as farm moon bounties afterward",Thawxtem,1

not moon bounties......,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

and if Thawxtem is far enough along in the divinity quest and no has a problem with it we may add that in as well,LW Mugetsu,1
currently going through the lost sectors now,Thawxtem,1
cool,LW Mugetsu,1
"well, Vex Offensive is no more... any ideas on where to kill lots of vex (that isn't the raid)?",Thawxtem,1
"Lost sector on Nessus, by the izanami forge, the one lost sector on mercury",Crizum,1
nessus,LW Mugetsu,1
I think crizum is talking about 2 good sectors to farm vex,Trissin,1
one and nessus and another on mercury,Trissin,1
Those are also my go-to vex farms lol,Trissin,1
"Yeah haha, specifically the one by izanami forge/that cabal public event (I forget the name, Artifacts Edge?) or the one lost sector on mercury, which the name doesn’t matter cause mercury is so small and only has the one lost sector",Crizum,1
There is also one a few on Io but they are further from the spawn points,Crizum,1
"If you are lucky you can get the vex public event by Failsafe, but it could also be ether harvest",Crizum,1
okay... I'm killing vex and getting zero progress,Thawxtem,1
Does the quest specifically call out “on the moon”?,Crizum,1
"""Sol Divisive Vex""?",Thawxtem,1
Oh,Crizum,1
best clue I have,Thawxtem,1
Yeah that’s gonna have to be in the raid,Crizum,1
if it is on the moon then just keep loading into the raid and killing the vex that spawn at the start.,thegoaliebear,1
"Or the raid portal entrance, you should be able to get there by loading in to sorrows harbor and going back to the place where you initially got the quest",Crizum,1
"For the Vex kills for Divinity, @Jeremy and I did the Nightmare Hunt for the Vex on the moon",AhRealMonsters,1
CORRECT,Jeremy,1
I don’t know if it is still in rotation in that area though,AhRealMonsters,1
Its not,Jeremy,1
BUT,Jeremy,1
:PepeShrimp:,AhRealMonsters,1
You can go to the moon,Jeremy,1
And go to that area anyways,Jeremy,1
Same way you pick up the quest,Jeremy,1
"Kill them, walk out of the zone and reset it",Jeremy,1
Makes it easier,Jeremy,1
Instead of having the load times for the raid. 🤷🏽‍♂️,AhRealMonsters,1
"This time, I really am ready to do Divinity portion in the raid. I double checked, to be safe",Thawxtem,1
@Thawxtem me and you both,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Remember to brush up on your geometry,RonInDune,1
I hate that,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
We did all the puzzles last night so we should be alright,LW Mugetsu,1
So if you run double special in Gambit (Mountaitop/Jötunn) you get an absurd amount of heavy ammo,RonInDune,1
"I was killing normal ads with Hammerhead and still had >50% ammo at the end of games, all without running a single heavy ammo finder",RonInDune,1
:o,Trissin,1
ok so this'll make getting bounties for Izanagi's much easier:,RonInDune,1
That's messed up for people who had to wait forever for that rare bounty lol,AhRealMonsters,1
I can finally get blacksmith lol,Trissin,1
Now if I can get Anarchy I will finally have completed two of the Collections page items: Exotics and Lore,RonInDune,1
Oh I do need that raid sparrow still,Trissin,1
lol I'll trade you the raid sparrow and 3 Tarrabahs for Anarchy,RonInDune,1
😿,RonInDune,1
I got the sparrow but not anarchy,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I'm cursed to not get it until @Thawxtem does,RonInDune,1
cleared final boss like 2 times on each char,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
got the sparrow in a run with y'all,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Honestly I don't have that many clears, around 28-ish",RonInDune,1
only run from the start that I did,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I know it has taken some people >50 runs,RonInDune,1
Ron you have 28 clears???,Trissin,1
Damn that's getting unlucky yeah,Trissin,1
"Yeah, we were doing 3x boss clears weekly pretty regularly for a bit there",RonInDune,1
ohhh,Trissin,1
that's right,Trissin,1
I don't think Goalie got it either,RonInDune,1
"But @Crizum did, as did a bunch of others",RonInDune,1
oh yeah I remember crizum and criz both got it on that one run lol,Trissin,1
The Criz-es have become too powerful,RonInDune,1
I accept that trade 😛,AhRealMonsters,1
"I also need the armor 2.0 versions of taken, fallen, and hive armaments still",Trissin,1
that's gonna be annoying to grind out,Trissin,1
I have Fallen and Hive,RonInDune,1
Hive armaments is easy enough to grind out form Menagerie,RonInDune,1
Got it in two weeks of 3 runs on each character,RonInDune,1
I've been going to the free Chest in Last Wish every week 3x but still don't have Taken armaments,RonInDune,1
I got 2x 1kv before I got taken armaments,Trissin,1
ooooof,RonInDune,1
I know Ari got it running chests,RonInDune,1
"Trissin, you've done solo Whisper and stuff, yeah?",Oathbreaker,1
Yeah,Trissin,1
how hard did you find it to be?,Oathbreaker,1
But not since armor 2.0,Trissin,1
it's kinda hard but not too bad with the right loadout,Trissin,1
taken and fallen armaments carried me,Trissin,1
"I mean, I've done solo Whisper, so it's not that difficult",RonInDune,1
As did old Ursa Furiosas,Trissin,1
Same as Trissin,RonInDune,1
I think I'm gonna do solo Whisper and Zero Hour,Oathbreaker,1
At least try it,Oathbreaker,1
Zero Hour is *hard*,RonInDune,1
I don't have armaments is the only thing lol,Oathbreaker,1
ursas are still my favorite exotic armor,Trissin,1
What about the 1.0 version,Trissin,1
nah,Oathbreaker,1
Don't have either of them,Oathbreaker,1
:(((,Trissin,1
For Zero Hour it took me so long to clear the 3rd room that I always ran out of time in the boss arena,RonInDune,1
I'm thinking double special for Zero Hour,Oathbreaker,1
oooh,RonInDune,1
Is that the one with small servitors and the one walker,Trissin,1
"For combat sections, with Anarchy for DPS",Oathbreaker,1
yeah,RonInDune,1
idk about double special,Trissin,1
"Unless one is like, meant for ad clear",Trissin,1
Riskrunner is super good tho,Trissin,1
Maybe mountaintop+riskrunner combo,RonInDune,1
riskrunner is real good but it *chews* through its fucking reserves,Oathbreaker,1
tru tru,RonInDune,1
I think there are enough ads in the boss room to supply riskrunner ammo,Trissin,1
but then it comes down to DPS plus shields,Oathbreaker,1
But I mean honestly I would use anarchy too,Trissin,1
Anarchy is sooooo good,Trissin,1
fire and forget,Trissin,1
Unnerfed skull of dire ahamkara would destroy,RonInDune,1
I'm just trying to theorize what I'd need,Oathbreaker,1
Wonder if Bastion would be good,RonInDune,1
for the shield bypass,RonInDune,1
Probably gonna start running some of the higher tier NFs if I get high enough gear to be useful in them,Oathbreaker,1
Arbalest works well for shield breaking.,LW Mugetsu,1
btw I had a guy with a Not Forgotten with >1000 kills in Iron Banner today,RonInDune,1
Dude was super chill on mic and kept guiding us on what to do,RonInDune,1
Carried the hell out of us too,RonInDune,1
"people like that exist, they're chill",Oathbreaker,1
Cause that's what real gamers do,LW Mugetsu,1
dude kept popping bubbles with Helm of S-XIV to save us,RonInDune,1
wish we had someone like that every game,RonInDune,1
"hmm, if you run something like Xenophage and a heavy finisher mod, that'd output a tonne of damage",RonInDune,1
Especially now with the buff Xenophage got,RonInDune,1
Might even break through the shields,RonInDune,1
I should use that gun more,Trissin,1
"I hate that gun, it shreds so much 😢",AhRealMonsters,1
A Gambit invader kept using it lol,AhRealMonsters,1
How good is the Lumina bonus in PvP? Is it worth running?,RonInDune,1
Depends on the game mode and the weapons getting buffed by it.,Infernosi,1
In comp?,RonInDune,1
"Riskier since it relies on teammates, but can work",Infernosi,1
"I was wondering if running a full healing build is worth it, with well of radiance, max grenade and lumina",RonInDune,1
Just stay alive and help others stay alive,RonInDune,1
Do your teammates tend to be better or worse than you?,Infernosi,1
Better,RonInDune,1
Then go for it,Infernosi,1
👍🏽,RonInDune,1
Starfire Protocol for double healing grenades can also work out quite nicely with it,Infernosi,1
"oh nice, I completely forgot about that exotic",RonInDune,1
"It has some merit, for example, I believe any high impact sniper will 1hit to the body with the buff",Oathbreaker,1
Even with the full overshield?,RonInDune,1
dang,RonInDune,1
I believe so,Oathbreaker,1
"It's like inertia override, or kill clip on Tatara",Oathbreaker,1
Just imagine that given to a Revoker. Literally no downside to going for bodyshots for 10 seconds or so.,Oathbreaker,1
I wish Lumina was energy so I could run Revoker alongside,RonInDune,1
"But I'm going to give this support build a shot, thanks guys!",RonInDune,1
"Any time, and please do let me know how it goes.",Infernosi,1
🤞🏽,RonInDune,1
hmm feels like this could have gone better,RonInDune,1
"but I'm not known to give up, so onwards to glory!!!",RonInDune,1
ok I give up,RonInDune,1
"If you want, I could run comp with you to help make that loadout work out.",Infernosi,1
"Busy right now, but I'm free during the weekend.",Infernosi,1

"1) Please get rid of the stupid noise being sung on the start screen.
Presumably it's meant to be both annoying and funny, but it's only annoying (actually it's high-pitched, out of tune, and highly annoying).

2) I would suggest that the game be configured so that players start with a SMG already equipped (when I first started, I was wondering how to get a gun, and I can see from the Steam discussions that I wasn't the only one with this problem).

3) Please, please, please, put in an on/off button, or a volume slider, so that the background music can be turned off, or at least turned down - it's quite annoying to be spammed with the same music repeating throughout the game (you can barely hear the gunfire, let alone any other in-game sounds).",Arixama,1

yeah I think so. like... I'm close to heroic for my buddy but would love that triple infamy to get him past fabled😂,thegoaliebear,1
Oh shit you doin gambit later @thegoaliebear ?,Arixama,1
yeah I'll be on ps4 on my buddy's account.,thegoaliebear,1
"Hit me up, I gotta grind out the quests",Arixama,1

"DOn't forget to stock up on completed Gambit bounties btw, they give triple infamy too",RonInDune,1
That's how I got my 3 resets in a season,RonInDune,1
There is a triumph for 3 resets in a season?,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
thankfully I don't need any resets.,thegoaliebear,1
For getting Dredgen I think,RonInDune,1
It doens't have to be 3 in a season,RonInDune,1
just doing all the seasonal  quests to get my buddy Savior.,thegoaliebear,1
Back when gambit launched you needed three in one season to get it,Crizum,1
But you could do three over three seasons,Crizum,1

"Sometimes I'm in the mood for gambit, and I keep playing it until I get a game where an invaders destroys me so hard that I want to uninstall the game",RonInDune,1
Holy cow @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 !!!,RonInDune,1
It was fun,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I also want to beat PoH solo flawless but that chamber of death it's pretty hard,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I need try on warlock,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
@Trissin and @Buttkikker did it a way back,RonInDune,1
they can give you some tips,RonInDune,1
"It might take some getting used to, but I'm confident you can get it @Sarsante - 76561197967628966",Trissin,1
"I've just accepted that when I solo queue gambit, my teammates are going to be potatoes 98% of the time. so I don't mind it as much now and just worry about myself in it lol.",thegoaliebear,1
"Especially now that you have experience with flawless GoS, you kind of get a better understanding of how to play safe and always be ready to get behind some cover",Trissin,1
"My gambit loadout is double special: mountaintop and Jötunn, along with Hammerhead",RonInDune,1
"It's foolproof, especially since you get so much heavy ammo drops",RonInDune,1
I literally had one guy the other day who would not shoot anything and just stand behind me then rush in to steal all the motes lmao,thegoaliebear,1
@Trissin that room is pretty hard on hunter. Maybe warmhusk can help idk. I might try with warlock,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"I see, it's definitely more challenging on a hunter for sure",Trissin,1
Wormhusk and invisibility do seem like a good way to go,Trissin,1
But I haven't put much thought into it,Trissin,1
"Yeah I'll try that and liars handshake with top tree, melee kills get you hp",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

"None of us killed the primeval, we won because we had done more damage",RonInDune,1

I literally feel that so hard hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
oh my god,Trissin,1
That's tilting,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
btw what was he using? sniper rifle?,Trissin,1
nah that new rocket launcher,RonInDune,1
Deathbringer,RonInDune,1
He definitely brought death,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
It's worse than even Truth,RonInDune,1
"oh wow, that's really interesting",Trissin,1
Yeah that little ball of death from Deathbringer literally chased me across the map,RonInDune,1
lol that's crazy,Trissin,1
absolute crazy,RonInDune,1
lmaoooo,Trissin,1

I want to go climbing again and not be in class *reeeeeeee*,Oathbreaker,1
"@Oathbreaker If your class is on the second floor, I have a brilliant suggestion on how you can do both",RonInDune,1
Ouch,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
LOL,Oathbreaker,1
It is indeed on the second floor,Oathbreaker,1
That being said the windows are like double paned and a fair distance above the ground,Oathbreaker,1

Climbing gym is like 15 minutes off campus so in 4 hours I will fucking haul ass to there. I've had the itch for the past week,Oathbreaker,1
Good luck!,RonInDune,1

@Arixama probably 5 EST and a short break for dinner at like 7 EST. then will be on for a few hours after that.,thegoaliebear,1

The first time I tried it I got killed by the ogres after that encounter was completed and I was already in the room,RonInDune,1
I've been scared to try... I've never been in the PoH before. Does it take long with a fireteam?,Thawxtem,1
Takes around 45 mins-ish,RonInDune,1
"Similar to Shattered Throne, though the encounters are easier",RonInDune,1

Hahahaha,Oathbreaker,1
honestly r/DestinyTheGame has become unbearably bad lately,RonInDune,1
I've unsubscribed,RonInDune,1
I don't think it's been this bad since Curse of Osiris tbh,Peronix,1
Pretty much everywhere is bad lately when it comes to destiny tbh,Crizum,1
WONDER WHY,Crizum,1
r/Destiny2 has too many memes but it's good,RonInDune,1
"r/LowSodiumDestiny is good, if not a bit slow",Peronix,1
"remember that one post where the dude said ""I'm not a hardcore player I got to 120k triumph score on accident"" and then went on to rant about how bad this season was😂",thegoaliebear,1
I gotta find that post. it was too good.,thegoaliebear,1
I half-heartedly want to grind for the seasonal armor ornaments but like.... I'm only rank 30 LOL,Oathbreaker,1
"here it is. if yall want to read a massive joke😂😂😂
https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/ejo4i3/its_not_franchise_fatigue_for_crazy_players_like/",thegoaliebear,1
"The main issue is that the subreddit takes one (legitimate) complaint, then exaggerates the problem until it's nothing but whining",Peronix,1
"Eververse complaints = legitimate. Saying Eververse has ruined the game, burned down our crops and killed our families = not legitimate",Peronix,1
Idk I don’t have any crops...,Crizum,1
*I saw Bungie pour gasoline over our yard*,Peronix,1
MY MILKSHAKES,Crizum,1
"I just find it funny bc a majority of the time all those people complaining are like, still dumping hours into the game every day.",thegoaliebear,1
"Also, saw a comment saying that Destiny is garbage now, and they know this because they were once a ""5,000 grimoire beta player""",Peronix,1
LOL,thegoaliebear,1
Bungie decided to cater to the every day player,Crizum,1
"That was the goal Luke stated, so that’s why people are raking them over the coals on not enough content",Crizum,1
Plus I think if you cater to the every day the people who don’t log in all the time get left behind and complain so someone is always bitching,Crizum,1
People are mad at the corridors of time going away,Crizum,1
"I think they're trying to figure out the perfect balance, and this whole seasonal idea was one of their ways to do it. Is it successful? Idk, not my place to say",Peronix,1
How do you cater to both casuals and hardcore players?,Peronix,1
"Without upsetting one of them, of course",Peronix,1
"oh for sure. honestly I didn't mind that this season was made for more casual players. I'll always love the game but I've been enjoying playing other things. the post by that dude trying to say he didn't have franchise burnout and then goes on to explain *literally why he has franchise burnout* is just like, the epitome of how hypocritical people on reddit are.",thegoaliebear,1
I think that guy was doing a meta post about the community being whiny,Crizum,1
"I don't think they have the right balance. Not enough of meaningful grind or things to do. Just seems kinda tedious for things like Randy's or other ""pinnacles""",Oathbreaker,1
Least that’s how I read it,Crizum,1
"like, if you have done all the content within a given season and now have a break between content stuff for the season title or whatever, it's totally fine to break from it until then.",thegoaliebear,1
They probably can’t do it without another overhaul but they should take some stuff from MH,Crizum,1
Imagine actually forging our armors and weapons from base models,Crizum,1
I feel like people legit force themselves to play it when they've done all they need to do in the game for a given time just so they can complain about it lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"I don't know, I think the community would complain about how grindy that is",Peronix,1
"Probably, but it’s a long term goal and the people that would make those high end armors will have put a ton of time in",Crizum,1
"I still remember that one post of a dude claiming Black Armory is the best state Destiny has ever been because of the grind, even though the subreddit complained about that same grind when Black Armory was active",Peronix,1
lmaooo yeah. people are always gonna complain. only reason I go on the subreddit anymore is to get a good laugh out of them.,thegoaliebear,1
I just use r/destinycirclejerk. Basically the same thing,Peronix,1
"Right now I just don't like how there really isn't content that is exciting. Sundial was cool for like... one week. The story this season has been absolutely amazing, so  I don't mind it. But the actual content has been kinda middling. Not quite lackluster, not quite decent/good. I wish I had useful suggestions for Bungie but I don't these days.",Oathbreaker,1
yeah I mean personally I haven't minded it. been playing other games and I'm getting Savior for one of my buddies so.  it's an excuse to play even more haha.,thegoaliebear,1
I've been going climbing at a local climbing gym. Absolutely love it. Physically challenging and mentally trying to plan out the routes,Oathbreaker,1

"Yea, I have one piece of Kraken Mare lore I forgot to get. Now it sits there, taunting me",Peronix,1
I think they won’t count it against the total usually?,Crizum,1

"Im curious to check my progression but everything is offline rn, they're probably rolling back inventories",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

"give me $5,000 and I'll tolerate playing it.",thegoaliebear,1
"I quite like it already, all that would improve my experience is me getting gud",RonInDune,1
I genuinely don't enjoy it. never have. never will.,thegoaliebear,1
"Okay, secondary question then for you specifically Goal.... why do you hate it so much? I'm curious more than anything, not trying to be antagonistic",Oathbreaker,1
I've never enjoyed it even in D1. always thought it was trash.,thegoaliebear,1
"like, I just don't feel any connection to it or any want to play it.",thegoaliebear,1
Does it stem from not enjoying the meta? or something different than that?,Oathbreaker,1
it's one of those things they could remove entirely from the game and I would probably not even notice lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
I honestly can't even say what it is. it's just garbage to me.,thegoaliebear,1
"Not for everyone, so fair enough.",Oathbreaker,1
"Like I said, not trying to be a pain, more or less just wondering why you don't like it so much",Oathbreaker,1
I go play BO4 and absolutely shred kids there and then go into crucible and it's just...so slow and boring to me. I think there are way too many crutches for average players. way too many bitch loadouts.,thegoaliebear,1
not saying the same doesn't exist in BO4. there are several crutch things for average players to make themselves decent. but I enjoy how fast paced that gameplay is.,thegoaliebear,1
"ah, I see. You're used to faster paced TTKs (it's even lower than Destiny, which is a slight touch under average from what I remember) so this must feel absolutely glacial to you",Oathbreaker,1
"And yeah, there's a lot of cheese/crutch shit in D2, I won't pretend it's super competitive and there isn't bullshit",Oathbreaker,1
yeah hahaha I think that's probably the biggest thing for me if I had to try and single something out as why I don't enjoy it.,thegoaliebear,1
"I have the opposite issue haha, I like the ttk in Halo",Crizum,1
"CoD was too twitchy no-scope for me, but I haven’t played that since MW2",Crizum,1
"Fair enough Goal, I can respect being used to a faster paced set of play. I used to play Titanfall so that TTK was pretty nuts at times. Destiny is slower, and while I enjoy Halo, I like the middle ground Destiny has.",Oathbreaker,1
"I also respect that Criz, Halo's TTK does allow for gunplay turnarounds and the like",Oathbreaker,1
Destiny has too many variables for me as well in crucible I feel like,Crizum,1
"honestly out of all the CoDs I've played, BO4 feels really good. even tho there are some clearly OP things in it, you can be super successful with like, nearly every single gun in the game.",thegoaliebear,1
"So Goal, would you be happier with the sandbox if more weapons were viable?",Oathbreaker,1
"I think if they made a mode in crucible where there were no abilities, supers, exotic armor perks...just a bare bones, solely gunplay mode, maybe with just grenades, I'd play that.",thegoaliebear,1
Honestly the only gunplay I miss is Quake,RonInDune,1
That’s what I thought Momentum Control was going to be,Peronix,1
"People will rush to the cheesiest loadout, understandable, but with the various stat breakpoints, weapon mods and rolls etc it isn’t conducive to “ive got 45 minutes a night let me hop on for some PvP”",Crizum,1
^^ that too.,thegoaliebear,1
I could personally say the same about PvE.,Oathbreaker,1
And that’s fair,Crizum,1
"idk...it really is just like, nothing about it is enjoyable for me.",thegoaliebear,1
You shouldn’t have to raid for a god roll PvP weapon,Crizum,1
"Again, fair enough, really, I was just curious",Oathbreaker,1
Also,Crizum,1
Actual servers,Crizum,1
"Idk, the only issue I have with PvP is one-hit abilities (hunter knife, shoulder charge, handheld supernova). Irritates me too much",Peronix,1
"Most of my issues, because I love the core gameplay of destiny, spring from p2p",Crizum,1
hunter knife at least you have to aim for the headshot haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"But with p2p you kinda don’t lol, cause they have to compensate",Crizum,1
the hit box with shoulder charge is absolutely ridiculous. I've been like 20 feet above a dude and gotten killed by their charge.,thegoaliebear,1
"And with shoulder charge you sometimes go through people, probably cause of lag",Crizum,1
"Still, unless it comes from a sniper, fusion or power weapon, it shouldn’t obliterate your health bar",Peronix,1
oh I agree aha.,thegoaliebear,1
Idk if contraverse has the same issues of not getting kills you should have and getting some bullshit in your favor haha,Crizum,1
But if I have to question “was that skill or NA internet” I’m taken out of the game and not having fun,Crizum,1
I don't think I would ever enjoy destiny pvp for the simple fact that a balanced competitive game would have most things that make destiny be destiny removed,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

@Oathbreaker the main thing I don’t enjoy about PvP is having to be really good at it in order to get crucible weapons,Thawxtem,1
*Not Forgotten intensifies*,Peronix,1
"Okay, of the weapons, I'd say 2 are definitely some you should be looking to get, being Recluse and Mountaintop. Mountaintop can be farmed in kill lobbies, and Recluse is something that can be progressed slowly but surely.

The others I'd say (unless you're looking to get ritual weapons) aren't as ""needed"" these days. Eventually in the Crucible you can get better and will achieve those goals. Are the requirements for some really high? Yeah, the Luna's quest comes to mind with some steps. Same for the NF kills using Luna's in Survival. But at the same time, I don't think they should be participation medals so to speak. Definitely could be easier though",Oathbreaker,1
"Still a valid opinion though, there's definitely some issues with how people can acquire them (even now)",Oathbreaker,1
"And I mean, personally speaking, fighting NF at its peak against someone who had used the weapon for some ungodly amount of kills on players was extremely difficult. Against someone who hadn't spent the time getting good and getting to 5500 legit at that point was a night and day difference. Could still fight and challenge those players, but hey, that's how I feel about it",Oathbreaker,1
"I think the komodo quest is decently balanced one, but the linear fusion kills are a bit much for a heavy archetype weapon",Arixama,1
Good example. Those could have been toned down a touch,Oathbreaker,1
"Like heroic glory is pretty easy to get to, and the kill count is doable with arbalest, but one kinetic exotic does not balance make",Arixama,1
"As much as I hated the mountaintop quest pre-adjustment, it did teach me to be really good with Fighting Lion",RonInDune,1
"I don't know, I think the linear fusion kills were great for forcing us to appreciate Bungie's sound design of the *Arbalest* ~~demon weapon~~",Peronix,1
"The only quest I truly did not like was Randy's, but momentum control made that super easy",RonInDune,1
Randy's was super grindy,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"MT I don't have the necessary will to do it honestly. Maybe when I find a kill lobby, because legit never gonna happen",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"oh man I don't think I'd ever use a kill lobby, it feels like cheating",RonInDune,1
It does,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Other day I quit a GoS run in a LFG because of cheating. On third encounter a guy got 10 motes, ran to the relay and somehow deposit all 30",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

I’m buying it regardless. Lol,AhRealMonsters,1

Does the Sunshot catalyst really need a 1000 explosion kills???,RonInDune,1

oh hmm,RonInDune,1
ok teh shuro chi thing thing seems easier,RonInDune,1
do you need Hunter tether?,RonInDune,1
That's where I did Izanagi and Hard light cata,RonInDune,1
It helps but isn’t needed since you want explosion kills,Crizum,1
But for sure shaves some time off,Crizum,1
perfect ty ty,RonInDune,1
I did it in the castelum,LW Mugetsu,1
I did the Skyburner's Oath cata there,RonInDune,1
in the castelum,RonInDune,1
Shuro Chi is where I go when I save like 3-4 catalysts since you can use rally flags,Crizum,1
So it makes heavy and special catalysts not terrible,Crizum,1
Plus you can snack during death screens,Crizum,1
oooh I do have the prospector cata half done for many days,RonInDune,1
thanks folks!,RonInDune,1

Still have 9800,RonInDune,1
Jeez,Crizum,1
Just did bounties,RonInDune,1
I’m only around 5.5k,Crizum,1
oh god so many bounties,RonInDune,1
"yeah now that all my obeslisks are level 11, there's atleast nowhere to dump a bunch",RonInDune,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
Once I had 5k and was just waiting for the sundial bosses I kinda peaced out for a bit,Crizum,1
I thought about doing all the nightmare hunts time challenges but they're kinda sketchy,RonInDune,1
Feels way harder than doing the Dreaming City timed challenges,RonInDune,1
They aren’t that bad,Crizum,1
"hmm, I just have Phogoth and Skolas",RonInDune,1
done,RonInDune,1
"There are different strats, Crota was the worst of them",Crizum,1
"Phogoth was the easiest, even got flawless on that",RonInDune,1
What's the Crota strat?,RonInDune,1
Crota I believe we ran two hunters with Orpheus rigs and a well warlock with Phoenix,Crizum,1
"Hunters take turns on tethering adds while warlock keeps well up every wave they can, 21% delirium on knights and solar weapons for normal adds",Crizum,1
"Nice, will try that soon then",RonInDune,1
Crota isn't this week right,RonInDune,1
"Clear room, bait Crota from the front and have the other person hit him from behind. He will one shot you otherwise",Crizum,1
oof,RonInDune,1
"You can ignore most champions, the worst is the first room ogre",Crizum,1
Divinity and Izanagi honestly drops the Ogres pretty fast,RonInDune,1
Oh and every attempt go to the tribute hall for ammo,Crizum,1
good point,RonInDune,1
If I manage to do this then I just need the solo/flawless PoH for Harbringer,RonInDune,1
I still need the ghost shell and ship haha,Crizum,1
Ohhh I completely forgot about the bloody ship,RonInDune,1
Oh well,RonInDune,1
"Also note it doesn’t have to be solo flawless, so you can find someone to help and play safe",Crizum,1
😮 new _emblem_,Trissin,1
time to start playing again,Trissin,1
It looks pretty cool too!,RonInDune,1
oooooh that is a cool emblem,Trissin,1
i need it,Trissin,1
Apparently if you have rank 10 for all the obelisks you get 4K a week in passive fractaline,Crizum,1
Nice,LW Mugetsu,1
"I have 4800 right now, but I haven't really been farming them.",LW Mugetsu,1
that's pretty neat.,thegoaliebear,1
I think I'm at like 4800 as well.,thegoaliebear,1
@RonInDune about how many sundials do you think to get 5 more entries for Constellations?,Crizum,1
8 ~ 10,RonInDune,1
"Also the nightmares this week are Ghaul, Phogoth, and Taniks",Crizum,1
hmm I might LFg for them then,RonInDune,1
holy crap that's crazy,Trissin,1
What are the lore book under Letters from Eris and The Book of Unmaking?,Crizum,1
how much does it tank to max an obelisk?,Trissin,1
Highest rewards are at level 11 and it’s like 200 a level iirc?,Crizum,1
so 2k to hit level 10 on an obelisk?,Trissin,1
and then times 4 obelisks is 8k?,Trissin,1
Could be 100 idk I capped them out like second week and haven’t touched them,Crizum,1
and that gets you 4k a week?? that's crazy,Trissin,1
"@Crizum That's the Pigeon and THe Phoneix, which is currently bugged according to Bungie",RonInDune,1
Trissin it's 2200 to max each out,RonInDune,1
You want to get to Level 11 to get the final mod,RonInDune,1
ohh okay,Trissin,1
so around 9k then?,Trissin,1
@Crizum and are you missing any of these:,RonInDune,1
yup 8800,RonInDune,1
uh oh I only have like 2k right now,Trissin,1
you get 800 fractaline from each weekly bounty per character,RonInDune,1
No Ron,Crizum,1
Wait maybe for every rose a thorn,Crizum,1
Plus 200 from Saint XIV per character,RonInDune,1
noooo I hate the weekly bounties so much,Trissin,1
I can't grind them anymore,Trissin,1
going back and forth in that area in the edz to kill 1 fallen captain,Trissin,1
**20 times**,Trissin,1
i cant,Trissin,1
you can also buy 6 fractaline skimmers that maxes out your chance to randomly drop fractaline from doing any activity,RonInDune,1
yeah lol don't do those,RonInDune,1
The Saint XIV bounties are far easier and can be done in one Sundial run,RonInDune,1
do you get fractaline from doing the sundial?,Trissin,1
or is it only if you upgrade one of the obelisks,Trissin,1
Very little,RonInDune,1
Like 10-ish,RonInDune,1
Hmm,Trissin,1
I think there are Obelisk upgrades that increase the chance of fractaline dropping randomly from various sources,RonInDune,1
There must be an optimal order to upgrade the obelisks to get more fractaline,Trissin,1
yeah,Trissin,1
Datto had a video on that yeah,RonInDune,1
"Oh sweet, I'll definitely check that out then",Trissin,1
@Trissin wait until the Osiris mission on EDZ where you raise sagira is the daily,Crizum,1

wait what,Trissin,1
where I raise sagira?,Trissin,1
That super fast CoO story mission,RonInDune,1
You mean the heroic story mission?,Trissin,1
oh,Trissin,1
Are there lots of captains in that?,Trissin,1
"I think it’s the second quest from curse of Osiris? The hidden temple in the edz, before you drop down there is a captain",Crizum,1
You can kill him and fling yourself off a cliff,Crizum,1
Ohh I see,Trissin,1
Not the most time efficient but you can also use a sniper to kill the dregs,Crizum,1
I see,Trissin,1

a server room for a supercomputer,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Cause it’s not only powering the servers, you have to power the a/c to prevent shit from overheating",Crizum,1
i know,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
have a liqui nitrogen cooled supercomputer,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
not possible,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
......maybe,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
They usually have powerstaions custom built for redundant power delivery,LW Mugetsu,1

Not enough unless it's a small server,LW Mugetsu,1

Yeah but you get sun cancer so solar isn’t safe,Crizum,1
not where i live,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Solar is free, but not steady source",LW Mugetsu,1
thats why you have batteries,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"but then again, that may not be sufficient",Saint 14's loyal follower,1

need like 5 GPU brackets😂😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
i'd believe it,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
the cooling was stupidly strong,LW Mugetsu,1
like we talkin -300 degrees strong?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
piped in nitrogen through the racks to keep it at a stable operating,LW Mugetsu,1
as low a -400 at times,LW Mugetsu,1
yup,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
maybe liquid hydrogen could be better....,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
hmm,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
dummy expensive tho,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yep,LW Mugetsu,1
but it is the most affective,LW Mugetsu,1
yeah,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
-400 degrees,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
setting up a single server is far easier,LW Mugetsu,1
you can just use liquid cooling like in a pc,LW Mugetsu,1
lol yeah I remember we wanted to test if we could fry an egg on the top of the rack,RonInDune,1
we even got the egg into the data centre then our eng lead found out,RonInDune,1
you can on an bare cpu after about 6 seconds,LW Mugetsu,1

but I have friends who have literally spend thousands of dollars on fate GO,Trissin,1
i've moved on to arknights,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I thought fate was a movie on Netflix,RonInDune,1
Thousands!!!,RonInDune,1
its a series,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yeah,Trissin,1
That's just addiction,RonInDune,1
very concerning,Trissin,1
oh actually how is arknights @Saint 14's loyal follower,Trissin,1
ive been getting ads for it _everywhere_,Trissin,1
actually quite a good game,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
It feels like gambling at that point,RonInDune,1
hey,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

What's the next most efficient progress for the season pass other than bounties? I left the grinding until now and I have literally 70 levels to go. Need to figure out the best possible way to get this done lol,Oathbreaker,1
Bounties with guiding light are about it,AhRealMonsters,1
Weeklies as well from ALL characters,AhRealMonsters,1
Crucible and gambit prime give a good chunk of XP as well,RonInDune,1
I think comp and iron banner gives more XP than regular crucible,RonInDune,1
I'm at the same spot as you @Oathbreaker I think I'm like rank 27 or something,Trissin,1
I'm considering just saying fuck it for this season really,Oathbreaker,1
"Sure, I kinda want the ornaments but like... I'm burnt out from having to hundreds of bounties in Shadowkeep. I don't really want to do it again lol",Oathbreaker,1
yeah. personally I don't enjoy how much leveling the pass relies of bounty completion.,thegoaliebear,1
Bounties are the *worst*,RonInDune,1
I want Savior but I don't want to grind,Trissin,1
"It has ended up being the only thing we do the whole season, just one bounty after another",RonInDune,1
Its not like I'll actually equip the title,Trissin,1
I don't feel like doing seasonal titles for the most part honestly,Oathbreaker,1
"unless it's something really cool, I just.... Meh.",Oathbreaker,1
"Enlightened is the only title I really want, because of how cool it sounds",RonInDune,1
"I respect the people who do want it, but they just don't really scratch a particular itch for me",Oathbreaker,1
Enlightened is a super cool one yeah,Trissin,1
Like even Unbroken I don't really care for so much,Oathbreaker,1
"I've just been getting back into destiny after the start of the season, and I've just been kinda doing the weapons quests and stuff.",Arixama,1
I've never super grinded for bounties,Arixama,1
Unbroken/rivensbane/Shadow etc are actually a true test of skill,RonInDune,1
Not just showing how much time one has to grind,RonInDune,1
The thing for me with college and stuff is that I don't have enough time to really get XP efficiently from other activities if that makes sense,Oathbreaker,1
^^ I agree with that. I would put Enlightened in there as well.,thegoaliebear,1
So I have to rely on bounties to push me to rank 100,Oathbreaker,1
all the raid titles + Unbroken are the titles that show true skill honestly. the rest are just...look how much time you have to be able to play the game haha.,thegoaliebear,1
"The dawning bounties with double xp were good for that, you basically had to run around to various NPCs and give htem gifts",RonInDune,1
Still hellishly boring though,RonInDune,1
Maybe if Crimson Days has x2 XP bounties I'll grind hard then to push me up there but I think I'm done for this season,Oathbreaker,1
I was away for most of the Dawning and was trying to not burn out on Destiny,Oathbreaker,1
yeah aside from the last sundial boss and empyrean foundation next week I won't be playing much until the next season aha.,thegoaliebear,1
Feels the same to me yeah,RonInDune,1
I'll probably do some Empyrean Foundation but like... other than that and finishing off Bastion I'd much rather just spend time doing other things,Oathbreaker,1
"DOOM 2016 has been fun, GTA Online is surprisingly entertaining, among other games",Oathbreaker,1
that and being able to do IRL stuff,Oathbreaker,1

"So it’s still bounties, but if you can get a decent amount of fractaline for your obelisks they will create passive sources for the season, and you can use those both to donate to the empyrean foundation as well as complete weapon bounties which I believe give some exp. You can buy the items which make them drop at higher rates in crucibles/strikes/gambit/sundial as well as do some of saints bounties (which are usually kill 50 of X, get 20 precision kills on Y) if you really don’t care about the season no need to go for it, but if you only kinda care and want something that will give you the most exp for the least amount of work that sounds like the way to go @Oathbreaker @Trissin",Crizum,1
at this point I'm basically doing exotic quests for weapons I'm probably never gonna use it just for the sake of completion,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

I’d still like to do a prestige leviathan to clear out the acrius ornament,Crizum,1
Big same,RonInDune,1

Any idea _how_ good it is?,Trissin,1
I like xenophage but haven't really found many good uses for it,Trissin,1
It's about an 8/Xen,Peronix,1
that one was kind of a stretch,Trissin,1
idk,Trissin,1
Sorry. Been having a mental block when it comes to humor. Hopefully it's just a phage,Peronix,1
I saw a reddit post showing the Xenophage combo did slightly more damage than Izanagi during GoS final boss,RonInDune,1
Oh wow,Trissin,1
That is effective yeah,Trissin,1
Probably because it's easier to hit as well,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, that makes sense",Trissin,1
Just gotta hope you get heavy between damage phases I guess,Trissin,1

But who would offer up super energy..,Crizum,1
Run the Gos mode that gives heavy ammo drops when you're enlightened,RonInDune,1

Ok that Xenophage post on reddit is a bit suspect. It does good damage but does not out dps Izanagi in a perfect  game,RonInDune,1

yeah but how do you get there,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
You can open the underbelly at the entrance of the leviathan using the levers,Trissin,1
which raid?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
You can go directly into the underbelly without having to do castellum or any of the encounters,Trissin,1

Dunno why,RonInDune,1
apparently if you have a lot of incomplete catalysts your new catalyst drop rate goes down,RonInDune,1

"right now I've 3 incompletes, sturm, darci and the acrius from prestige levi",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"I have 8 incomplete, plus I somehow completed the Black Talon catalyst without ever equiping the gun",RonInDune,1
18 completed,RonInDune,1
and I had like almost a dozen unfinished at some point,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
dang,RonInDune,1
"Should farm those out someday, but darci is terrible to complete and I don’t think it gives too much of a boost right?",Crizum,1
"yeah, it increases stability but so many kills with heavy it's kinda annoying",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
The Darci stability boost is actually quite significant,RonInDune,1
You don't need to get any DARCI kills to complete the catalyst,RonInDune,1
@RonInDune you got black talon by completing lord of wolves,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Just have it equipped in crucible,RonInDune,1
ohh,RonInDune,1
hm i thought i needed darci kills,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
so i guess I can equip it and get some beloved kills,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

Need to find me the Sunshot Catalyst though honestly,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah it's pretty fun now, the range is huge and I think the explosive rounds have no damage falloff",RonInDune,1
I used it in comp to farm solar kills for Lunas,RonInDune,1
Yeah explosives and timed payload shots don't have damage falloff for a portion of damage,Oathbreaker,1
Nice,RonInDune,1
oh I need to finish sunshot catalyst too,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"They split the damage into two parts, a guaranteed damage portion that is fixed damage no matter what, and the actual bullet, which can still experience falloff",Oathbreaker,1
I've the kills but not the explosive kills,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Wonder if explosive round trust would be better in comp then,RonInDune,1
"No, 180s really aren't a good choice for PvP",Oathbreaker,1
ah,RonInDune,1
lemme break out the spreadsheet lol,Oathbreaker,1
It comes down to mostly ttk issues,Oathbreaker,1
I'm like 20% on the solar kills and it's going excruciatingly slowly 😦,RonInDune,1

can dragonfly kill btw?,RonInDune,1
"If you want other options, Adhortative, Outlast, Elatha FR4 with the right roll, Mindbenders, Last Man Standing, Omniscient Eye, Right Side of Wrong, Twilight Oath, or Beloved are all good legendary solar options",Oathbreaker,1
"No, Dragonfly cannot kill unless the enemy is weakened",Oathbreaker,1
"hmm I do have some good Beloveds, it's what I used to get Revoker",RonInDune,1
"As for exotics, you could use LoW, Jotunn, Devil's Ruin, Eriana's, or Sunshot for secondary solar weapons",Oathbreaker,1
"Jotunn works well in regular crucible, but in comp people dodge it super easy",RonInDune,1
@RonInDune I need 5 to grab a smoke then I can join to finish sotp,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

Silicon has some okay stats and a decent 72rpm zoom, so it too would be at least a decent competitor for your kinetic slot.

so people got hype to get Savior today only to find out it ain't it 😂,thegoaliebear,1
wait it literally is a community effort to get the title LMAOOO,thegoaliebear,1
"Maybe, we have no idea what the actual requirement is. I'd expect there to be a mission or something finishing up the storyline here in the next few weeks to lead into the next season",Arixama,1
How many weeks of the season are left?,Arixama,1
from someone in another server.,thegoaliebear,1
There is no way they don’t adjust the amount needed for us,Crizum,1
"The whole reason those higher levels are ?????? is so they can raise or lower, I’m not gonna save fractaline",Crizum,1
yeah  its smoke and mirrors to create engagement,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah I don't think there's a reason to hold onto fractaline. donate your 5k for the community event emblem at the least.,thegoaliebear,1
but still...kinda dumb.,thegoaliebear,1
Bungie can’t actually hold the title back,Crizum,1
idk...it's still time gated no doubt.,thegoaliebear,1
https://prnt.sc/qxjds7,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
maybe there's another step to the restoration quest that doesn't require community engagement ??,thegoaliebear,1
"Time gated sure, but they wouldn’t make the community requirements unobtainable",Crizum,1
"||There is mention of the tower obelisk picking up a signal from an unknown location, so maybe there will be a mission for that?||",Peronix,1
no that wouldn't happen.  it's just anticlimactic is all lmao.,thegoaliebear,1

"||Probably the Speaker. Some say it's Rasputin, but I don't see why Osiris would call Rasputin a ""thug""|| @Crizum",Peronix,1
"||Osiris could be plenty mad at the Speaker if he saw something that put his friends in danger, considering how close Osiris is to Saint and how Saint sees Speaker as a father makes more sense to me than Rasputin, but who knows if this is even a thing and not a red herring|| @Peronix, oh and Ron don’t click random things",Crizum,1

all obelisks are lvl 35 lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
So I think with weapon bounties @Trissin and @Oathbreaker can finish off the season pass for sure,Crizum,1
yup I just got 5 levels in like 10 minutes,RonInDune,1
Why do you say that?,Oathbreaker,1
And you’ll be able to get your pick of Perfect Paradox or other weapons,Crizum,1
Wait,Oathbreaker,1
Does donating give progress towards weapon bounties?,Oathbreaker,1
yarp,RonInDune,1
"Four donations completes a bounty, you can hold four at a time",Crizum,1
So for every 400 you donate you get four bounties done,Crizum,1
"So what I'm hearing then is do all the fractaline, dump it into obelisks this week, claim, dump remaining into obelisks, repeat daily until next week, do the same thing, ad infinitum?",Oathbreaker,1
"Invest al your fractaline in upgrading obelisks until the final week, get your returns, and on the last week spend time listening to a podcast and turning in fractaline",Crizum,1
Wait shit I can just buy the instant rank up things,Oathbreaker,1
Holy shit yeah that's huge,Oathbreaker,1
I still can't find them; Where are the instant rank ups?!,Thawxtem,1
"Did you finish the quest so you can donate? If so, no clue",Crizum,1
btw the Crucible page has a new entry,RonInDune,1
I need to throw up.,thegoaliebear,1
Bungie:Please enjoy Trials!,Crizum,1
@thegoaliebear,Crizum,1
"bungie: play crucible or we're gonna try and force you into it anyway

yall don't sleep on my disgust for it. I won't touch it😂😂,thegoaliebear,1
Flashbacks to Drifter's Wacky Adventures in Season 6,RonInDune,1
jesus,thegoaliebear,1
A whole season dedicated to fixing crucible might be *slightly* better than a whole season dying in Gambit and Reckoning,RonInDune,1
"Gambit isn’t bad, blueberries are",Crizum,1
True,RonInDune,1
And they had the nerve to add it when it's Infamy week,Thawxtem,1
||***HEAVY TRIALS BREATHING***||,Oathbreaker,1
a whole season dedicated to fixing crucible sounds like Odyssey is suddenly my favorite game.,thegoaliebear,1
@Thawxtem after you talk to Osiris when you finish the quest you can purchase the Light-Fused Fractaline,Crizum,1
Bungie please just give me a reason to play again. Give me an itch to consistently scratch with *something* that'll keep my attention,Oathbreaker,1
trials ? pvp ??,thegoaliebear,1
I’ll still go for the title if it doesn’t require flawless,Crizum,1
see that's how I feel about a week or two into a new season when the PvE content is already fairly stale,Oathbreaker,1
if anything about next seasons title aside from needing the pvp ritual weapon requires pvp idc about it lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"Oath, it’s about 10k per bounty, so 10 bounties will get you a season pass level",Crizum,1
"I will say, this past Season has been fairly alright in terms of content for a seasonal drop. I also really enjoyed PoH and GoS",Oathbreaker,1
just praying the *entire* season doesn't revolve around pvp.,thegoaliebear,1
10k xp?,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
holy shit,Oathbreaker,1
To speed it up I’d recommend being in a fire team for the extra exp you get,Crizum,1
I mean hey.... if I can farm out a metric shitton of Jack Queen King 3s *and* get up to rank 100,Oathbreaker,1
I'd be fucking happy,Oathbreaker,1
Assuming you have the shards and Spider is feeling frisky on what he’s offering for glimmer,Crizum,1
You can just buy a bunch of the exotic items that raise resonance,Crizum,1
I got about 2k shards. Couple of metric tonnes of planetary mats too so I can be flexible about glimmer purchasing,Oathbreaker,1
"I’ll probably have a bunch of weapons just to hit +20 on the season pass level, because why not",Crizum,1
"70 levels of the season pass is something like.... what, 700 bounties? 10 bounties per level, with 70 levels?",Oathbreaker,1
"Just about, you’ll have to account for not having all the xp boosters at the start",Crizum,1
"Each one requiring 10 fractaline, so I'd need something like.... a comfortable 10k to ensure I have enough to purchase all the bounties",Oathbreaker,1
So this week I'd need to buy enough of the instant rank ups so I can really profit in the later weeks,Oathbreaker,1
What roll am I looking for on the jack queen king 3?,Crizum,1
No exact perfect roll,Oathbreaker,1
lemme get the best of the best,Oathbreaker,1
I have a list of best in slot perks and good combinations,Oathbreaker,1
"Common ideal sights and magazines: Sureshot/Hi-cal, ricochet, ap rounds, light mag",Oathbreaker,1
Sights are all fairly decent so any are okay,Oathbreaker,1
"column 1 perks that are good: demolitionist, subsistence. Almost all others are mediocre.",Oathbreaker,1
"Column 2 perks: Swashbuckler, Dragonfly, Rampage, Surrounded (VERY SITUATIONAL)",Oathbreaker,1
"Supremacy is a confusing gamemode, htf is the scoring calculated",RonInDune,1
"PvE wise: Ideally, you use it as a grenade machine with somethng like demolitionist and maybe surrounded or one of the other damage perks",Oathbreaker,1
"1 point on kill, 1 point on crest pickup IIRC Ron",Oathbreaker,1
ty ty,RonInDune,1
PvP ||JuSt UsE sPaRe MiNdBeNdErS 4hEaD|| is more like demolitionist/swash for perks,Oathbreaker,1
hate the game,RonInDune,1
so many freaking mindbenders christ,RonInDune,1
it's what happens when it's the only shotgun that can roll quickdraw and is the hardest hitting archetype,Oathbreaker,1
also I wish a sword heavy attack would one shot an arcstrider,RonInDune,1
Sadly it's more efficient to use tractor,Oathbreaker,1
or any other heavy capable of shutting down a super,Oathbreaker,1
😦,RonInDune,1
"I was using nova bomb purely as a shutdown super, anytime I see an arcstrider or whatever, kill em asap",RonInDune,1
Reminder that you can run away from arcstriders because you run faster than them,Oathbreaker,1
huh,RonInDune,1
I just try to float above,RonInDune,1
"Especially on Warlock, you have the straight line speed with bunny hopping to get away",Oathbreaker,1
yeah seriously just run,Oathbreaker,1
I'll keep that in mind lol I mostly just blindly panic,RonInDune,1
"1000% of the time unless the arc staff is popped directly on you, you can escape",Oathbreaker,1
"half the time in scrims when I was still doing them a few months ago, my team would literally just start running away. Immediately disengage from enemies and haul ass in the other direction",Oathbreaker,1
lol ok that's actuallly pretty funny,RonInDune,1
https://tenor.com/view/wtf-runaway-johnny-depp-captain-jack-sparrow-gif-5206303,RonInDune,1
"if you know how to bunny hop on warlock ron, you have so much more straightline speed than that of an arc staff",Oathbreaker,1
I'm super rusty with it but I can show you when i get a chance,Oathbreaker,1
"I think I can do it, but not reliably though",RonInDune,1
Practice it,Oathbreaker,1
easier on some maps in comparison to others but knowing when to use it can save you a life in comp,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah I'll do that,RonInDune,1
This dude has 1332 kills on their not forgotten,RonInDune,1
rookie numbers,Oathbreaker,1
Annoying bugger,RonInDune,1
lol,RonInDune,1
I've run into players with multiple thousands,Oathbreaker,1
ooof,RonInDune,1
"I dunno why I keep running into these guys, they're way better than me lol",RonInDune,1
personal best was running into a guy with close to 20k back towards the tail end of Season of the Drifter,Oathbreaker,1
bloody hell,RonInDune,1
Because MM is all sorts of weird,Oathbreaker,1
That was pre-nerf NF too,Oathbreaker,1
"Honestly, sweaty fucking matches but was definitely fun to try and play against someone like that",Oathbreaker,1
I suppose if you're good enough to fight back,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, when there's a big skill disparity it sucks",Oathbreaker,1
also remember ron,Oathbreaker,1
kills /= skill,Oathbreaker,1
someone could have about 30k kills total but just play a *lot*,Oathbreaker,1
"agreed, but honestly if someone's good enough to get Not Forgotten then I assume they're pretty skilled",RonInDune,1
"Unless you buy it, there's no shortcuts lol",RonInDune,1
"I will say this much: legend doesn't take as much as it used to. Lot of people talking that it's easier in some aspects.

Besides, NF doesn't really have anything going for it. The one bonus it has is being able to body shot for the kill after 2 headshots. Otherwise, it takes your energy slot (something that spare doesn't) meaning you can't run a good quickdraw shotgun, or a good sniper. It has poor handling, and it doesn't even hit range cap IIRC. just barely falls short of 30m at 28 m. Still lethal with perk out to about 32m though.",Oathbreaker,1
"That being said, it does still take some skill (and a certain sense of masochism with the state of Luna's Howl) to get Not Forgotten",Oathbreaker,1
Does it have good aim assist? that's what made spare feel so good to me,RonInDune,1
79 AA. That's slightly higher than average IIRC?,Oathbreaker,1
Lemme check in comparison to my other HCs,Oathbreaker,1
My spare has AA of 97,RonInDune,1
"beaten by Jack King Queen 3, death by Scorn and Hard Light",RonInDune,1
Yeah so,Oathbreaker,1
there's a handful of HCs above NF's AA value,Oathbreaker,1
hmm,RonInDune,1
a hell of a lot more around or below it,Oathbreaker,1
Also I highly recommend icarus over targeting adjuster ron,Oathbreaker,1
but that's coming from a hunter so I'm airborne a *lot*,Oathbreaker,1
"icarus? I don't really fly and shoot, tend to sniped out of the air",RonInDune,1
especially with the good scout rifles around,RonInDune,1
yeah then I mean.... TA is fine as a mod if you stay grounded more often than not,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah airborne for Hunters means something completely different than it does for Titans and Warlocks haha,Crizum,1
That vertical leap is nuts,Crizum,1
I mean I just only use icarus lol,Oathbreaker,1
even on Titan and Warlock,Oathbreaker,1
I like to use my vertical space,Oathbreaker,1
takeaway from Titanfall I guess,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, hmm, could probably spec for it and use lion rampants",Crizum,1
nah,Oathbreaker,1
Dunemarchers,Oathbreaker,1
Or OEM,Oathbreaker,1

"For me, either Le Monarque or No Turning back worked excellently to get lots of headshots",RonInDune,1
Plus I did most of it in regular gambit to get lots of easy medals,RonInDune,1

"Yeah Im super moody, tired of the same 980nf, 980 nightmare, poh and gos every week",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Take a cheetos break,Crizum,1
Ive been playing MH and logging on to do random raids with y’all and the game is more enjoyable for it,Crizum,1
"Im kinda taking a break, this rotation all I did was one poh run (boss 3 times) plus a 980 nightmare solo yesterday.",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

Nice!!,RonInDune,1
Im down to 980NF too if you want to do one,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

Anarchy machine broke,Crizum,1
Probably,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

"Last time was weird, your voice was pretty low. I don't remember that happened before",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Oh I just remembered one thing, mic settings for nvidia shadow playare applied all the time, it could be that",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
If you lower mic volume there acually lower win mic volume,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Yea, I tested it out last night and it is significantly louder",Kimarais/Nick,1
Quality should be better as well since it's a standalone mic,Kimarais/Nick,1
oh heck that looks super professional,RonInDune,1
I saw that a couple of streamers replace their blue yeti with that mic,LW Mugetsu,1
"It seems to be working great so far, plus the amount of versatility it has in terms of directional sound pick up is super cool.",Kimarais/Nick,1

"^^
🙏",Trissin,1
"Fractaline is still the most passive way, but yeah there are a lot of different ways to do it",Crizum,1
I ain’t go nobody to play doubles with 😦,Crizum,1
I'm sure our resident PvP nut @thegoaliebear would be delighted to help you Crizum,RonInDune,1
Wonder if this can be abused,RonInDune,1
Get your shinobu's vows out friends,Trissin,1
Time to really hurt Gahlran,RonInDune,1
Loool,Trissin,1
"You know the people at the party that obviously don’t want to be there, and stand in the corner getting progressively drunker while insulting everyone? That’s what me and goal teaming up for duos would be",Crizum,1
See I've only seen that happen on TV and it's always hilarious,RonInDune,1
So what can possibly go wrong?,RonInDune,1
Get her stream numbers up haha,Crizum,1
Also this is big hmmm,RonInDune,1
Wonder if this means swords will no longer be limited to the heavy slot,RonInDune,1
I think there's some confusion,Trissin,1
"They still take ammo, they just have an extra meter now",Trissin,1
right?,Trissin,1
hmmm,RonInDune,1
not sure,RonInDune,1
that's what I took away from the writing,Trissin,1
@Crizum I will drink one beer for every time Crucible doubles makes me rage.,thegoaliebear,1
Also I really want to do heroic menagerie now to get the cool swords for my warlock and hunter,RonInDune,1
so I should stock up this weekend then.,thegoaliebear,1
because I only have 6 cans left.,thegoaliebear,1
do not get alcohol poisoning,Trissin,1
"Just open a line of credit at bevmo, or whatever local liquor and wine shop you have",Crizum,1
I'll pray for your liver,RonInDune,1
that ship sailed long ago😂,thegoaliebear,1
Uh oh,Trissin,1
You know how you work out your muscles and you make them stronger by exerting them?,Crizum,1
"That’s what drinking is, it’s a workout for your liver",Crizum,1
ah so my liver is probably dangerously obese now lol,RonInDune,1
never exercised,RonInDune,1
There’s still time!,Crizum,1
the only state I will play doubles in is intoxicated.,thegoaliebear,1
wait,Trissin,1
the sword update,Trissin,1
**it removes sword skating??!?!?!?!?**,Trissin,1
@Trissin how so?,Arixama,1
"also, if you do the perfect paradox timelost bounty you can have more than 4 at a time",Arixama,1
https://twitter.com/Ehroar/status/1225562774337662976?s=20,Trissin,1
They’ll find another way,Crizum,1
From what I'm reading it seems like you won't be able to sword boost anymore?,Trissin,1
but also this is twitter&reddit so,Trissin,1
not exactly reliable,Trissin,1
Trissin I was gonna ree when you pinged me but then I saw what you pinged me for,Oathbreaker,1
So thank you,Oathbreaker,1
So does the weapon type stay bad or does a small part of the player base get to do zoomies,Crizum,1
It'll be a good way of lessening the amount of fractaline I need for the r100 grind,Oathbreaker,1
we have literally no idea how it's goin to affect speedruns at this point because we have no idea how it'll work,Arixama,1
Sounds like swords will be nicer to use in general play though,Infernosi,1
Wonder if it'll affect the Riven sword cheese,Peronix,1
"@Infernosi yeah, I’d honestly take swords getting a QoL upgrade and being better to play around with over the only niche they serve is speed runs and trolling",Crizum,1
DID SOMEBODY SAY SWORDS?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"awww shit, they're making my useless swords more useless.... what the hell bugie",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
They're making them better for general use it seems.,Infernosi,1
*crosses fingers*,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
please add a sword that uses secondary ammo,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Light ammo regens for them,Infernosi,1
hole up..... light ammo?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"ohhhhh, replaces your melee",Saint 14's loyal follower,1

i need more SWORDS,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"I think it's pretty easy, the main challenge used to be the 780 enemies I'm pretty sure",Trissin,1
But also I haven't done it recently,Trissin,1
"So this weekend, let's do both 3x Scourge and a Heroic menagerie, if we have people",RonInDune,1
LEMMEE INNNNN,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Ok everyone who wants to do either, raise your hands",RonInDune,1

hmm,RonInDune,1
:pepeD:,Kimarais/Nick,1
"Heroic menagerie is doable with 3 ppl, but it's kind of rough on certain encounters",Kimarais/Nick,1
It would be easy to run after the raid tho,Kimarais/Nick,1
*raises hand*,Samakain,1
hey sam's back,RonInDune,1
"Also, if anyone doesn't have the Izanagi catalyst, it drops from the chest",RonInDune,1

Honestly with Divinity/Izanagi it's a joke,RonInDune,1
I did only the easiest one this week the gatelord but I did solo,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"yeah nightmare hunts are kinda easy, only a couple of them are more annoying",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

"so it does, Bungie always goes all in",RonInDune,1
The grimoire has a lot of the really cool shit,Kimarais/Nick,1
I'm waiting for my copy of vol 1 and 2,Kimarais/Nick,1
The problem is none of it is really explored in game,Crizum,1
The Grimoires are *fantastic*,RonInDune,1
That's true,RonInDune,1
^,Kimarais/Nick,1
You play the game and you get “Who the fuck is Ana Bray and why do I care?” “Just who does Zavala think he is?” “Why should I give a fuck about Osiris?”,Crizum,1
Oh and,Crizum,1
Yeah especially Ana is supposed to be one of the most powerful Hunters in history,RonInDune,1
"“Wow Xol is a total fucking joke, this is a god?”",Crizum,1
"speaking of Xol, who are the other worm gods",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Ana ""my golden literally makes wells charged with light"" bray",Kimarais/Nick,1
Did you read the new piece of lore about how Osiris basically controlled the whole city during the battle of five fronts,RonInDune,1
"Eir, Akka, Ur? Right Ron?",Crizum,1
He was *badass*,RonInDune,1
"Akka, Eir, Ur, Xol, Yul",Oathbreaker,1
"Yul, Eir, Xol, Ur and Akka",RonInDune,1
"There was a lot of lore around the Taken King, I think Akka is “dead” right?",Crizum,1
Yeah Oryx consumed him to get the power to Take,RonInDune,1
"Akka is what Oryx used to form the Dreadnought iirc, used his body to make it",Oathbreaker,1
holy shit guys my head hurts reading about the lore....,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
back to our regularly scheduled conent,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"The story of Aurash, Xi Ro and Sathona is so cool",RonInDune,1
Someone should write a proper novel about the 3 sisters,RonInDune,1
"wait, so lemme get this straight each of the ""factions"" has therE own kind of unique background/story?",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yup and Future War Cult is the **best**,RonInDune,1
I'm impartial to the factions honestly,Oathbreaker,1

THEY WILL BE DISABLING HuNTERS AND REMOVING TELESTO ENTIRELY,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
whoa caps,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Probably the warlock super glitch,Crizum,1
they need to buff dawnblade,RonInDune,1
I hope they fix the loading into tower,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
that stuff blows,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"if they try to remove telesto, telesto shutdown all servers and deletes all data but its own",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Dead Orbit is too fanatical, but I agree that Earth is a beacon that risks Humanity as a whole, FWC I believe wants to only focus on eternal preparations for a war, which is all fine and dandy but they rely on a machine to predict the future by breaking people's minds iirc. New Monarchy just wants to be dictators basically lol.",Oathbreaker,1
i wonder if bungie will evr make a true open world destiny,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"The Dead Orbit fleet will come in handy someday, so they have some value",RonInDune,1
New Monarchy are just bad,RonInDune,1
"Space Goths, Space Fascists, and Space ‘MURICA",Crizum,1
"I wouldn't say they are bad, I just thing NM is just too tied down to the Last City and Earth as a whole",Oathbreaker,1
tru tru,RonInDune,1
"*If* FWC is right then trying to bunker down *or* run against this oncoming conflict will ensure that humanity loses. Asymmetrical warfare may be the only method of survival. FWC probably has the best grasp of that. DO is just gonna find somewhere else to call home, NM is just gonna try to turtle and weather the storm. Neither are possible.",Oathbreaker,1
Yea FWC are the only feasible option that lets us fight by using the guardian paracausal nature to the fullest,RonInDune,1
If we plan on doing heroic menagerie I woul love to join in,Thawxtem,1
speaking of it,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"For sure, in like 30 mins ish?",RonInDune,1
!lfg create,RonInDune,1
1/12?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
12 people...,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Menagerie isn't coded into the bot so it justs defaults to 12,RonInDune,1
ah,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
it's 6 as usual,RonInDune,1
Hahaha,Crizum,1
12 man menagerie sounds hilarious,Oathbreaker,1
thatd be utter chaos,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"I'm gonna have to bail, I'm super tired from last night",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
@Crizum if you want join menagerie you can take my spot,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I remember a bug that existed for a very short period of time back in the Division 1 that let you invite more than the group cap of 4 into a mission,Oathbreaker,1
division,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"Put myself as an alt, would need two others. @Peronix did you get your heroic clear?",Crizum,1
"Unfortunately, no. I'm about to hop off the computer, though, so I won't be able to participate tonight",Peronix,1
@Destiny [PC] Anyone down to do a heroic menagerie run in a few minutes?,RonInDune,1
We have 4,RonInDune,1

Love the Bioshock reference,RonInDune,1
"""Would you kindly"" is pretty similar to ""O Guardian Mine""",RonInDune,1
oooh they're rebooting Anthem,RonInDune,1
https://blog.bioware.com/2020/02/10/anthem-update-february-10/,RonInDune,1
Anthem: the Runback,Kimarais/Nick,1
lmaooo,thegoaliebear,1
If they can pull off a No Man's Sky or a FFXIV I'll be truly impressed,RonInDune,1
Absolutely,Kimarais/Nick,1
"maybe if they never branded the game as the ""Destiny killer"" they wouldn't have run into all the shit that they did lol.",thegoaliebear,1
Neither The Division 2 nor Anthem quite  came up to Destiny's level anyway,RonInDune,1
they hyped themselves up for something they were never ready to take on.,thegoaliebear,1
yup yup,RonInDune,1
I low key want to get the division 2. but I know I'd barely have the time to play it between my other games lol.,thegoaliebear,1
"maybe if it's on sale at some point for like, ridonkulous cheap.",thegoaliebear,1
"I liked the snowy New York setting of The Division 1, but the setting of TD2 just seemed so boring",RonInDune,1
the customization aspect of td2 seemed decent enough to get my interest. but it's definitely not a game I'm just gonna buy lol. definitely will wait for sales.,thegoaliebear,1
Division 1 did have a great atmosphere. Just wish it was more mechanically sound,Kimarais/Nick,1
"I wish we had a new Crysis, set within a fully realized city like The Division",RonInDune,1
That would actually be sick lol,Kimarais/Nick,1
I know Crysis 3 was a flop but I really liked that one too,RonInDune,1
"Anthem was like, speed run Destiny",Crizum,1
lol,RonInDune,1
"An acclaimed studio that made some of the best games of previous generations releasing a live service game, but Destiny was first and wasn’t tied to Frostbite so it had more time before people started to get upset with the lack of content",Crizum,1
"Also most of the ""Bioware"" that made anthem in a shell of the team that gave us mass effect",Kimarais/Nick,1
yea that's the saddest part,RonInDune,1
I'm not even sure how good the next Dragon Age is going to be,RonInDune,1
Haven’t played The Division but is it the boring ass Ubi open world paint by numbers but with other people playing with you wait that’s ghost recon,Crizum,1
"Kind of, but the world is prettier and the environmental storytelling is top notch",RonInDune,1
And the city itself is incredibly well realized,RonInDune,1
Though I've never been to New York so I can't vouch how realistic it is,RonInDune,1
"yeah, I am a sucker for nice worlds to explore in a game haha, which is why td2 is always a game that's sorta like, in the back of my mind I just need to remember to pick it up on sale now lol.",thegoaliebear,1
"Ooh I actually own a copy of anthem, maybe I'll give it another try",Trissin,1
It sounds like the game is on auto-pilot while a small team works on it in the background so you have a good year or so before anything may change,Crizum,1
"@RonInDune at this point I'm not sure that the story can be awful, but gameplay might be rough for DA4",Arixama,1

I think I have boss cp on my titan... if you don't care for doing the full run,AhRealMonsters,1
the likelihood of someone who hasn't done it yet from here joining is pretty low. so you'll probs be with the couple who have done it a lot...that makes it easier to learn anyway I think aha.,thegoaliebear,1
I've done that thing twice. and that was too many times for me😂,thegoaliebear,1
I haven't done it this week so I'm down to try,RonInDune,1

@Thawxtem that makes sense. You're talking about the cursed ball dunking area... fun place with all the adds haha,AhRealMonsters,1
Fun... that’s one word...,Thawxtem,1
How does one do that room solo without the wipe mechanism activating?,Thawxtem,1
You have to be very quick and makes lots of murder happen,Kimarais/Nick,1
Or do the ball dipping glitch,Kimarais/Nick,1

@Kimarais/Nick and I 2 manned it,AhRealMonsters,1
Boss sucks to deal with though,Oathbreaker,1
When I did it I was like 960-ish and it was tough as heck,RonInDune,1
Gun is kinda nuts in the right situations but the boss slaps you silly unless you're above 970ish,Oathbreaker,1
Mostly depends on if @Thawxtem needs it. I know I got it when it came out.,Arixama,1

due to mass stupidity of most players,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
If I’m drinking and can relax I’m having fun,Crizum,1
I mean Jotunn only works against people who can't strafe. The second you get someone who can hold A or D Jotunn kinda falls off as a weapon,Oathbreaker,1
Is a cool gun though,Oathbreaker,1
If I’m using a weapon type I hate I’m not,Crizum,1

what about gambit,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

I'm that guy i guess,Samakain,1

but noooooooooo,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Yeah, MM right now is in a weird spot.

In terms of getting better at PvP and Crucible in general, it take some time and some effort. You should ask yourself if you want to dedicate yourself to playing Crucible and trying to improve.
@Arixama can attest to me absolutely hating PvP a while ago, back in S3 it took me 5 hours to win a single game. I loathed the mode, absolutely hated it. Loved it in D1 but couldn't stand it in D2Y1. But I put the time in, and got a little help here and there to get better and now I'm pretty good (not to be a narcissist)",Oathbreaker,1
that sounds pretty narcissistic,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I mean literally a year after I started trying to get better at the mode I won a tourney,Oathbreaker,1
Good point that. I have taken three months off the game as well. Which i'm sure contributes.,Samakain,1
He is good thou. You should see what Oath can do with a sword :3,Samakain,1
*rocky starts playing*,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Next season will be a crash course,Crizum,1
Yeah I just don't know how else to word that really without coming off as a narcissist,Oathbreaker,1
@Oathbreaker what are your thoughts on swords in PvP,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
They're in a weird spot,Oathbreaker,1
"I hate them, honestly",Oathbreaker,1
But I respect the fuck out of people who commit to using them,Oathbreaker,1
Y'all are fucking madlads,Oathbreaker,1
im tryna make use of swords,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
i wish heavy ammo wasnt a pain to get in PvP,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"To me the only use of a sword is for 3 peeking which I hate. Otherwise, you're better off using other weapon types",Oathbreaker,1
"see I don't agree with that, because then people go back to picking HMG ammo up every minute",Oathbreaker,1
I for one do not like being killed by the same Hammerhead for the 15th time in a row,Oathbreaker,1
facts,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Do they still get the same 40ish rounds?,Infernosi,1
I think it's cut down to 30 something now?,Oathbreaker,1
and swords only geet like 5 swings.....,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I could be wrong and I'm in the middle of re-writing an assignment so I can't really check,Oathbreaker,1
"That's the other issue with swords. You have to fully commit to a close range fight contending with shotguns, HCs, and just any close range weapon, burn ammo for blocking, just to swing once and hopefully get a kill",Oathbreaker,1
"I JUST GOT AN AD FOR DESTINY WHILE PLAYING DESTINY, IM FINISHED",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
They're hilarious ambush weapons though. Crouching to put yourself off radar and then standing near a doorway or whatever and instakilling anyone who steps through is great.,Oathbreaker,1
"well you see, @Oathbreaker people cant hit shit",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
at least when im using a sword,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Maybe in your lobbies lol, I tend to face the QP gods for the most part",Oathbreaker,1

I did find out about Engagement Based Matchmaking and that’s our nightmare future,Crizum,1
that's the one where the game adjusts values in an engagement based on player skill yeah?,Oathbreaker,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
so fucking ridiculous,Oathbreaker,1
engagement based?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
how tf does that work,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Which can be tweaked to mean the people that spend money in the in game shop can magically get more games where they are the killers,Crizum,1
"They want you to play the game and be engaged, if you are losing too much they risk losing you so you get thrown down a tier basically",Crizum,1
oh so its basically the more you play the higher you go?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"IIRC there's a model being considered as a base where if two players, A and B, are of completely disproportionate skill levels, match each other, the game adjusts things like health values on the fly to try and ""balance"" out the fight. Basically if A is a god at the game whereas B is a half-baked potato, the game may lower A's health or damage resistance in order to make the fight ""fair""",Oathbreaker,1
Oh that’s a different version of the same model I think,Crizum,1
that's super interesting,Trissin,1
The one I read basically would do everything in its power to keep the whales playing,Crizum,1
I mean that's what they currently have Crizum (losing lowers your skill tier). It's a broken mess for the middle population but on the extreme edges of skill it appears to be working somewhat.,Oathbreaker,1
Imagine using thundercrash or golden gun on a player and they just dont die,Trissin,1
lmaooo,Trissin,1
Aka IB but always,Oathbreaker,1
I mean kinda but it’s still a “skill” based matchmaker,Crizum,1
I’ll go down if I lose until I start winning again,Crizum,1
This is a “he’s won 2/5 throw him from 4500 to 2000”,Crizum,1
"Yeah, the model you're suggesting is *slightly* different",Oathbreaker,1

"About the harrow map above when I was trying to solo it what made easier to navigate there was knowing exactly what every ! is. so from left to right: rolls going up and down; rolls going forward and backwards and last one on the right are lanterns.

I didn't play one match of IB all of y3 so far. and I love that for me.,thegoaliebear,1

don't think that triumph will do anything to make pve players play ib lol.,thegoaliebear,1

I don't have much time to play anyway. so when I do get the chance I'm not gonna spend my time in pvp lol.,thegoaliebear,1
One was like 250 kills wtf,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I might play a bit being a complete monkey for MT quest. If I see some progress I'll get the glory,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

who?,thegoaliebear,1
mountaintop,RonInDune,1
I only know of Randy's and Revoker.,thegoaliebear,1
never heard of her.,thegoaliebear,1
Yeah I will give a shot. Yesterday I played a bit with zero skill colony and got 8% and 5% progress but zero medals,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"I never use MT on PvP, beacuse I tend to kill myself with it",RonInDune,1
but in PvE it's godly,RonInDune,1
I honestly couldn't be bothered. only reason I got recluse was bc I got lucky with my lfg group.,thegoaliebear,1
Recluse is easier to get and it's a pretty good gun to use anyway,RonInDune,1
I wih the PvE pinacles were as good,RonInDune,1
well now it's easier. back when the glory system was ass it was a headache.,thegoaliebear,1
Revoker I still need a bunch of kills but I would like to get that done in the future,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
true true,RonInDune,1
For Revoker just stay back all the time and get easy bodyshot kills,RonInDune,1
they can't make pve pinnacles good. they need a reason to force people into pvp lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
😦,RonInDune,1
Yeah thats exactly how it works,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
grinding strikes to the point of monotony ?? child's play. if you're not getting an aneurism from wanting to smash your keyboard bc of how bad crucible is then bungie doesn't want it.,thegoaliebear,1
very sad lol,RonInDune,1
having fun with weird load outs in strikes ?? what is fun?,thegoaliebear,1
go in pvp where you turn the corner and see 4 red sniper dots looking right at you. now that's fun.,thegoaliebear,1

"Yesterday I played some matches, got chaperone crucible step done. Tried colony to see MT progression",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Since there is no more point to do anything but 980NF I might play colony again today,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I don't even have a point to do 980nf lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Its great for ascendant shards and exotics,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I liked playing earlier this season but without a raid I am lost lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
It drops exotics with high stats,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"my thing with ascendant shards is like, I have my one armor set that has good rolls and is all master worked.",thegoaliebear,1
and with how you can just swap mods...I don't need more shards. gets stagnant.,thegoaliebear,1
"I have enough again now that I can get a full set for my warlock master worked 

*if they enable warlocks again*",thegoaliebear,1
"I like to masterwork stuff, my orpheus build is fully masterworked. For my nighthawk Im missing the mask. My alts also have full masterworked armor",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah see i just don't have that amount of time for the game lol.,thegoaliebear,1
But sadly my 980NF buddy pretty much quit the game,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
personally i think ascendant shards should be given more frequently in the season pass.,thegoaliebear,1
"because, like you mention the 980 nightfalls, the great majority of the player base doesn't even bat an eye toward those.",thegoaliebear,1
Yep that's true,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
how many do you even get out of the season pass?,thegoaliebear,1
"Maybe 3, idk",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I like doing the 980 NF beacuse they're basically the only challenging PvE activity in the game right now,RonInDune,1
i think that's right aha.,thegoaliebear,1
Kinda pitiful that,RonInDune,1
"I agree Ron, that's one of the reasons I like it too",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"but yeah. i don't do 980 nfs. and it's just because of my time constraints. i'd rather just finish out the season pass, and once that's done maybe i'll do some.",thegoaliebear,1
yea that's a good idea anyway,RonInDune,1
"but i think you should get a bonus 2 shard for completing the season pass, so you get 5 out of it.",thegoaliebear,1
"that way, if you're a player who doesn't do 980 nf due to your PL restraint or you are a casual player who just does enjoy grinding out bounties and stuff, each season you would have enough to masterwork a full set of gear that you like.",thegoaliebear,1
Personally I would farm 980nf everyday but one thing is lfg one guy other is lfg 2 guys,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah that's a good idea,RonInDune,1
https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1227273354052112387,RonInDune,1
"i do the gunsmith bounties whenever i can. so like, i do have the ability to buy ascendant shards every so often if there's something i *really* want to masterwork.",thegoaliebear,1
Thats good but they also need to add a way to get good armor. Season pass has high stats but there is no other way to reliable farm them,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
for sure.,thegoaliebear,1
the armor you get from leveling up the obelisk are always ass lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
Raids drop their own seasonal armor so there is no way to farm dawn armor specifically,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
i got lucky on my warlock that my gear from the season pass dropped with really nice rolls for what i like to play on my warlock.,thegoaliebear,1
It seems to me the cap is 66 or really close to that. Besides season pass armor I've a handful of 66 stats and not a single one higher,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah i have never gotten higher than 66 either.,thegoaliebear,1
Sundial rewards would have been a good way to farm out that armor. like you get to choose your reward anyway based on what you have unlocked. add the armor to it aha.,thegoaliebear,1
"Maybe it could let you choose one high stat per week, kinda like how pinnacle works",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Otherwise it would be super easy,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah that would be nice. *sighs* oh well haha.,thegoaliebear,1
like that would also keep players coming back on a weekly basis ya know. log in and play sundial each week knowing you will be able to choose one high stat armor piece. makes it easy to fill out a set and then keep coming back in hopes of maybe getting a piece with rolls more geared to what you like.,thegoaliebear,1
I like how they completely forgot about the Menagerie,RonInDune,1
Which had a functional system for all of these issues,RonInDune,1
Yeah but people wouldn't pay every 3 months to play menagerie,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
So I understand why they're doing what they're doing but that's exactly why I think it's bad,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
i thought menagerie was f2p now?,thegoaliebear,1
It's,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"But they can't sell it as a new thing every 3 months, like vex offensive or sundial",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"i mean, they're definitely still trying to find some sort of balance for both casual and hardcore players. unfortunately, a perfect balance won't ever exist, so we'll just have to roll with the seasons as they come aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"Yeah honestly nobody has done anything quite like Destiny even now, so Bungie is basically floundering in the dark",RonInDune,1
Like ideally we wouldn't need this seasonal activities if we have similar activities already in-game. But people wouldn't pay to have menagerie revamped or reckoning,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"As much as it sucks to say they need to do what they did in D1, have guns become outdated and have newer versions to take their place",Crizum,1
Otherwise once you have the guns you like what’s the point of doing anything,Crizum,1
"like from now until the end of this season, i'll just be finishing my season pass and grinding out the enhancement cores to get my ascendant shards. i can probably get on board with 980 nightfalls at the very end of the season aha.",thegoaliebear,1
"but i agree. i've been using the same core guns for like, the last 4-5 months. some even longer.",thegoaliebear,1
Cmon goalie in 1 hour-ish we can run 3 times every other day,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

i don't mind it now because i don't have anything left to do this season haha.,thegoaliebear,1

"but yeah, i can do some this week if you'd like @Sarsante - 76561197967628966",thegoaliebear,1
@Crizum yeah that sucks.,thegoaliebear,1

i thinkg orpheus rig is the only exotic i fully masterworked.,thegoaliebear,1

What's that gun called again,Trissin,1
The Long goodbye?,Trissin,1
Think so,Oathbreaker,1
It's a decent PvP sniper,Oathbreaker,1
Just want some more options and variety lmao,Oathbreaker,1

I don't like Apostate,Oathbreaker,1
People really like it but the fucking rectangular scope throws me off,Oathbreaker,1

I'd rather use Revoker tbh,Oathbreaker,1
Beloved and Borealis both feel very good,RonInDune,1
sorry I'm not cool enough to join the revoker gang,Trissin,1
Hahaha,Oathbreaker,1
I'm running Revoker/Ancient Gospel in comp right now,RonInDune,1
Bite is a good option for primary snipes,Oathbreaker,1
"I actually have like no progress in that quest, I should do it",Trissin,1
Otherwise use Supremacy honestly,Oathbreaker,1
this is really embarrassing,Trissin,1
For primary yeah Supremacy is brilliant,RonInDune,1
I don't have a good supremacy roll,Trissin,1
The kinetic 90rpms aren't good IMO,Oathbreaker,1

"on m&k it would be pretty nasty, I take that back",Trissin,1
what was that?,RonInDune,1
A sniper?,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, it was an exotic sniper in d1",Trissin,1
ah yeah we need some energy snipers,RonInDune,1
NLB would be really really strong in D2's sandbox,Oathbreaker,1
A primary ammo sniper with literally no zoom,Oathbreaker,1
It was the only primary sniper in D1 right?,Crizum,1
Correct,Oathbreaker,1
So yeah it was a scout rifle on human growth hormones,Crizum,1
"There were two special ammo weapons that used primary ammo in D1, both were meta-defining and snipers in their own right; No Land Beyond and Universal Remote",Oathbreaker,1
"Incorrect

I think exotics are too easy to get in d2,Trissin,1
they _should_ be super rare,Trissin,1
huh Doctrine of passing looks like the Halloween auto rifle,RonInDune,1
I feel like in D1 legendary engrams dropped just a little more than exotics do now,Crizum,1

Exotic drop rate was also like.... D2 world drop rate of an exotic,Oathbreaker,1
"You see an exotic engram, you go to rahool",Crizum,1
*legendary*,Crizum,1
what,RonInDune,1
that's illegal,RonInDune,1
That was never a thing Crizum,Oathbreaker,1
Because when they had the lower level rarity Engram shit exotic engrams didn't drop,Oathbreaker,1
They didn't start dropping until Y2,Oathbreaker,1
Wait was it purples became blues?,Crizum,1
oof even that's bad,RonInDune,1
"Now, legendary decrypting into blues was some *bull fucking shit*",Oathbreaker,1
no wonder people hate Rahool lol,RonInDune,1
I mean they could upscale too right?,Crizum,1
Could you pull from collections or was that not a thing yet?,RonInDune,1
So a blue could theoretically be a purple?,Crizum,1
No collections iirc,Crizum,1
"Ron will also never know the pain of Warlocks having Sunbracers sold 7 weeks out of 10 by Xur, or all exotics dropping as Crests of Alpha Lupi",Oathbreaker,1
"No collections at that point, no",Oathbreaker,1
oooof,RonInDune,1
And yeah they could upscale but it was uber rare,Oathbreaker,1
"D2 vanilla was them listening to every complaint about D1, turns out the community doesn’t know what it actually wants",Crizum,1
"The issue is they listened to *every* complaint about D1. There's gonna be a hard split between the two sides. Some loved the changes, others hated them.",Oathbreaker,1
They should have committed earlier to PvP and PvE being separate for balance I feel haha,Crizum,1
"Like a base, competitive PvP mode and the fiesta mode where you bring your PvE stuff in and everything is bullshit",Crizum,1
I know that isn’t what they want but eh,Crizum,1

hmm that might be harder to maintain in the longer run,RonInDune,1

We apologize for the inconvenience caused by our apologies for the prior inconvenience,Crizum,1
7 PM PST is wild,RonInDune,1
Yeah that’s insane,Crizum,1
They just didn’t want us to smash the remaining fractaline donation levels,Crizum,1
it's the same as last time and its actually pretty expediant,Arixama,1

goddam,RonInDune,1
it's not a bad game per se but massive/red storm devs in charge of it are really bad,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"it super hard to get good loot, game gets stale because there is no content what they do? change all talents and stuff so you need to refarm everything",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
those sound like repeating mistakes from TD1,RonInDune,1
"game is not out for 1 year, I had to refarm everything 3 times, quit in the 4th time and now it's the 5th time gonna need to refarm",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

there is no relevant additional content since may/june when the raid was released,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
they released a couple missions here and there and that's all,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
well that's why I was waiting for a massive sale lol. I would never buy it full price😂,thegoaliebear,1
I pre ordered the most expensive version *facepalm*,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

@Sarsante - 76561197967628966 gotta be honest that sounds like me and Destiny,Crizum,1
"“I put 2,000 hours in the game, no content big issues”",Crizum,1
"but it's true, content they announced as part of year 1 pass being delayed for months",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"also what they delivered really below expectations, not only mine",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
the worst is not even the lack of content is they make everything you took like 500 hours to get useless,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
imagine every d2 season you delete your chars and start over,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
It seems like Division 2 could have been an expansion for 1 but they made it its own thing?,Crizum,1
And now Division 1 stuff is an expansion for 2?,Crizum,1
it seems so,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I didnt bother research but rumour is year 2 of division 2 we'll go back to nyc,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
idk if it's gonna be a remastered map or a new part of the map,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"The expansion leaked, and yeah",Crizum,1
it's not clear to me,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

that's a very tom clancy plot,RonInDune,1
"pretty cool, reminds me a bit of Crysis 2",RonInDune,1
it's not a bad game at all,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

"oh another ""destiny killer"" so how long will it take them to reboot that game?",thegoaliebear,1
Honestly the game's made by the same people who made Bulletstorm so I don't think the franchise was ever truly alive,RonInDune,1
lmaooo,thegoaliebear,1
never even heard of it either haha.,thegoaliebear,1
well... I'm glad I could add TD2 to my library tho lol.,thegoaliebear,1
I liked bulletstorm 😦,Crizum,1
FWIW Square is also behind it,Crizum,1

"may i just say, that the division 1 was a mind blowing game",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
at least when it came out,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Agreed,RonInDune,1
i loved it,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
it was almost as good as ghost recon,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I've wanted to live in a snow covered city ever since the game,RonInDune,1
You think that Ron but you don’t,Crizum,1
"yeah no, especially a city",Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"Just watched the actual trailer for Outriders, it seems like angry destiny",Crizum,1
And the color palette screams mid-gen 360/ps3 brown to me,Crizum,1
no bright colors?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
There is some sharp green in there somewhere,Crizum,1

"wait no, outriders look like rage",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
just with dark browns,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Why do some developers insist on boring, monotone color palettes?",Peronix,1

because that implies death and destruction,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"i mean, look at doom 2016",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"Idk, why do developers lean on white guy with shaved sides of head or angry Mohawk lady",Crizum,1

Doom knows what it is and leans in to it and is better for it,Crizum,1
“Go fucking murder everything while Mick Gordon just shreds this guitar WHY ARENT YOU KILLING”,Crizum,1

“You could do so much more why are you flipping burgers”,Crizum,1

I don’t want it Ron I want destiny to be good 😦,Crizum,1
"you can only go so far with an idea, before it becomes a bore",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
like star wars,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Star Wars has limitless potential and they focused it on a small group of characters and mismanaged the ip. Destiny could go anywhere,Crizum,1
Well there are some hints as to what they're working on:,RonInDune,1
We have lots of planets and stars,Crizum,1

No thanks,Crizum,1
something like fallout,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
but destiny?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I don’t want a solid thousand or so warlocks glitching supers and crashing my pc,Crizum,1
well they have concept art there but it seems more like mobile games,RonInDune,1
meh lmao. different tastes. I like the way Destiny is set up. I want more exploration in the worlds out of it tho.,thegoaliebear,1
1 thousand shoulder charges,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
moar maps,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

*fallout 76*,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

Sometimes I think it would be cool if they did something like the 24 person raids in FFXIV,Crizum,1
infinite fireteams,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"The real question is, where's our Anthem clan",Peronix,1
"Not gonna lie I’m interested in it, but the beta gave me motion sickness",Crizum,1
It's good until you finish the story. There's no endgame besides three (four?) missions,Peronix,1
"Yeah, the Beta was fun to play around in",Infernosi,1
Less content than Destiny 2 at launch,Peronix,1
I don't like the loot system in anthem,Trissin,1

I decided I should embrace the calling to become trash https://prnt.sc/r1cv7c,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
you can do it!,RonInDune,1
"Oh man, truly best of luck sar",Trissin,1
Embrace the Strength of the Fighting Lion,RonInDune,1
That grind almost killed me,Trissin,1
"Same, trissin, same",RonInDune,1
yeah it's annoying,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Tether in mayhem is the only way for me,Trissin,1
that should work pretty well,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I ran triple grenade launcher in crucible for a month straight,RonInDune,1
"im running momentum control, swapping back and forth between martyr + colony and fighting lion",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
use the militia's birthright too,RonInDune,1
"I feel martyr and colony suits me better, requires less skill lol",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah martyr is a great gun on it's own,RonInDune,1
Since it's 2 difft triumphs I might try comp and ruin ofher ppl day but progress is faster,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Then later if I've time left I grind glory or do the glory part next season,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
baby steps but eventually I'll get there https://prnt.sc/r1f1rr,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
godspeed.,thegoaliebear,1
"""Baby steps"" its been only a few hours  and you've progressed so much",Arixama,1
oh they decreased the requirements right? now it's slightly more sensible,RonInDune,1
"they did Ron, but still quite grindy https://prnt.sc/r1f75z",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah it's still pretty bad lol,RonInDune,1
Find a trade lobby,Crizum,1
"I tried that, no success",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
oh man that always feels a bit cheaty,RonInDune,1
it does indeed,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Idk I look at it like,Crizum,1
You cheese bosses right?,Crizum,1
Skip mechanics all the time,Crizum,1
I wouldnt mind at all tbh but it does feel cheaty,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
if pvp wasn't so terrible trade lobbies wouldn't even need to be a thing haha.,thegoaliebear,1
yea but doing that in PvP feels like it crosses some line,RonInDune,1
just my opinion,RonInDune,1
well I guess when I get it I'll never use a gl again,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Hah,Crizum,1
everytime I use MT in PvP I kill myself more than anything else,RonInDune,1
"ehh...i think with raid bosses, using cheeses is almost fun in a way like ""yo, look at this ridiculous method we can use to kill a boss."" but with pvp it's like ""this is literally so awful no one would ever want to do this legit""",thegoaliebear,1
"and then the people who do it legit think they have some kind of like, moral high ground or whatever lmao. it's just bad every way you look at it.",thegoaliebear,1
agreed,RonInDune,1
To me there is legit no difference between a cheese lobby and getting a streamer to carry you to 5500,Crizum,1
oh i agree lol.,thegoaliebear,1
You have put in the same amount of work as win traders,Crizum,1
both are sketchy to me,RonInDune,1
"it's like, you're still dedicating your time to getting it done regardless.",thegoaliebear,1
"honestly, if pvp was at least decent, there wouldn't be so many ads and sites for paid recovs.",thegoaliebear,1
i think it just speaks volumes to how bad of a state it's in. people would rather pay someone hundreds of dollars to get them to 5500 and do luna's/nf than spend their time doing it themselves.,thegoaliebear,1
Well there will always be people with more money than time,Crizum,1
Back when I played final fantasy xi there was decent money selling in game gear to like middle eastern businessmen or princes,Crizum,1
wtf,RonInDune,1
yeah I agree pvp is really bad but I cant see a way to fix it and still be a destiny pvp,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
There are tons of people to whom money means nothing,Crizum,1
It’s a flex,Crizum,1
"what makes destiny destiny, the movement, the abilities, supers... if you tune everything down will be better pvp but wont be destiny",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"yeah for sure. i got lucky with my friend who offered to do luna's/nf for me. like, i would have never done it and i would have been perfectly fine without it lmao. but he offered 🤷‍♀️",thegoaliebear,1
Yeah but you’re a GIRL,Crizum,1
😩,thegoaliebear,1
I can pretend to be a grill,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I’m kidding lol I had friends help queue with me to get recluse for the MMXI title,Crizum,1
Rover helped me to get my recluse as well,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Not gonna lie kinda wanna play crimson days for some of that loot,Crizum,1
I was stuck at like 1400 glory and he carried me in like 7 matches to get 2100,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
But I’d lose out on 666 valor,Crizum,1
Did you see you get matching emblems if you buy both sparrows?,Crizum,1
"THere's too many sweats in Crimson days sadly, I won one and got stomped every other time",RonInDune,1
Do you need to win or just participate?,Crizum,1
the state of momentum is basically a ton of ppl doing MT,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
it's disgusting,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Wait for Mayhem and use tether trap with colony,Crizum,1
just participate,RonInDune,1
Well if anyone wants to do the non PvP crimson days stuff let me know,Crizum,1
"Im using colony, easiest thing to get kills",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
@Crizum I'm working on my bounty right meow if you want to run a few,AhRealMonsters,1
Until The Division 2 finishes downloading lol,AhRealMonsters,1
TD2 was a 56 gig download dang,RonInDune,1
Used my office connection to do it,RonInDune,1
Sounds good hopping on now,Crizum,1
okie dokie,AhRealMonsters,1
Finishing my match,AhRealMonsters,1
anyone for finishing today's crimson bounties?,RonInDune,1
Lost sector and one story mission,RonInDune,1
I'm gonna be back on around 8 cst if you haven't gotten them done I'd be down,LW Mugetsu,1
"I think one of my bounties will time out before then, but we can do the other",RonInDune,1
Ok. I need the nightfall for two and campaign mission,LW Mugetsu,1
yea same,RonInDune,1
I can Ron,Crizum,1
"cool after this match then, thanks",RonInDune,1

"Ah okay I’ll go to orbit, in general chat as well",Crizum,1
"In case you didn't get it last season, here are the secret triumphs for Crimson days:",RonInDune,1
Anyone care to do Crimson Days bounties? Warning though: I need a quick break about every 40 minutes or so to apply spray paint,Thawxtem,1
I need the nightfall and campaign mission in a fireteam of 2. I'll be on around 8pm cst.,LW Mugetsu,1
Weren't you doing the CoS with us at 8?,Thawxtem,1
Oh yeah. Completely forgot about it.,LW Mugetsu,1
Never mind,LW Mugetsu,1
!lfg search,Thawxtem,1
"It looks like someone dropped out of the raid. Before we actively look for a 6th if goal doesn't want to/can't make it, could I try to contact a really nice random player I met last night? We were talking about raids and other things seeing as he hasn't played in a while",Thawxtem,1
Go ahead! Might be fun,RonInDune,1
"He was increadibly chill, and even friended me on Discord",Thawxtem,1
"i'd rather play some TD2 tonight, but if i'm needed i could join.",thegoaliebear,1
"My person says he's up for it, but he might need a minute more to join",Thawxtem,1
"oh shit, i completely forgot there was a raid tonight",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
@Crizum @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 just making sure you two remembered the raid tonight- Iwant2now and Mugetsu both said they forgot,Thawxtem,1
"i mean, im still participating",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
didn't say you weren't. Didn't mean to imply that,Thawxtem,1
"Yeah I remembered, still online if anyone wants to do more crimson days stuff, may as well finish it off getting everything but that triumph shell",Crizum,1
"oh, my bad",Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"yes, although we'll need to set up a different room; I invited someone who isn't in the clan",Thawxtem,1
Do a group call maybe?,RonInDune,1
"still fidgeting in that stuff on discord- I think I just need to be friends, right?",Thawxtem,1
yarp,RonInDune,1
"just call them, and then keep adding the others to the call",RonInDune,1
Alternatively we could always set up a dump discord? Clan members can use it to chat with fandoms if they ever have to lfg? I don’t know if there is an auto-boot function that removes people in certain ranks?,Crizum,1
There is if they go offline without a rank I think,Infernosi,1
Has anyone here played Wolcen?,RonInDune,1
I was looking for an easy Diablo-lite game to get into but all the ARPGs these days look so complicated...,RonInDune,1

I like it a lot,Peronix,1
well it's no Cat Quest,RonInDune,1
How easy is it to get into?,RonInDune,1
"Pretty easy. It's not as overwhelming as, say, Path of Exile.",Peronix,1
"Nice, I might try it out then",RonInDune,1

"No problem. I recommend getting it now, because the price will go up from $30 to $45 tomorrow",Peronix,1

Why middle crystal dude on right tho,Crizum,1
Uh oh,Trissin,1
Why he no kill knight,Crizum,1
oh no,RonInDune,1
👀,AhRealMonsters,1
He has calus emote,Crizum,1
Why he do this,Crizum,1
And like I don’t buy him not remembering the encounter because he “corrected” my explanation and gave the same explanation,Crizum,1
I can’t. How you die to knight in first encounter,Crizum,1
:lul:,AhRealMonsters,1
Sounds like a hulu customer,AhRealMonsters,1
knight is too strong man,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

i just dont think he has that WIPE mindset,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
We could maybe 'end' and try one or two tries with WIPE members?,Thawxtem,1
"It’s just that this is not a hard encounter, and if we’re walled here we are not getting past either phase of Galhran",Crizum,1

uh oh,Trissin,1
that doesn't sound too promising,Trissin,1

It's because he's not using Misfit,Peronix,1
"I mean, it was a while ago but when we ran CoS I recall we also had some trouble with the first encounter",Trissin,1
Maybe it just takes a few tries for everyone to get back into the swing of things?,Trissin,1
maybe having a faulty fireteam-mate can be a problem too,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Naw he ran out of mid way too much lol,Crizum,1
faulty teammate,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Like he’d be all the way on the right and go “I wasn’t missing from swap”,Crizum,1
I think he only played green,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"oh, when you have people denying their own mistakes then that's a really bad sign",Trissin,1
yup,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"no, just spire 1st encounter",Thawxtem,1
but it used to be pretty hard to get,Trissin,1
"mb, @Thawxtem is right",Trissin,1
he did say he focused on doing a lot of leviathan raids,Thawxtem,1
raid report is our friend,Trissin,1
I’m just paranoid so I always assume someone with all the tools at their disposal who is constantly out of pocket is trolling,Crizum,1

Now that I have hive barrier I may go for flawless solo pit,Crizum,1
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?,Thawxtem,1
join the club @Crizum,Trissin,1
barrier and armaments are godlike for flawless poh,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
but tbh you don't need hive barrier or stuff for it,Trissin,1
@Crizum pit is actually why I wanted to run CoS,Thawxtem,1
"like, hive barrier and mods and other min/max things help",Trissin,1
it's so good after a dmg phase just nade some mobs for full heavy again,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
it's so good after a dmg phase just nade some mobs for full heavy again,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah i think hive armaments might be the only one you really ~~need~~ want,Trissin,1
damn @Sarsante - 76561197967628966 do you have hive armaments 2.0???,Trissin,1
I do 🙂,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

i am too scared to use my remaining 1.0 mods,Trissin,1
i dont want to run out,Trissin,1
at least you could put 1.0 on anything,Thawxtem,1
yeah but I think I only have like 1 left,Trissin,1
I ended up deleting all of mine,Thawxtem,1
"same goes for fallen, taken armaments and stuff",Trissin,1
"oh 1 and zero for me it's the same, I would save it lol",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Taken armaments hit me hard...,Thawxtem,1
"i need farm taken and fallen mods, i dont have them",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

i can't do that,Trissin,1
"unless i'm deleting like, shaders or other garbage like that",Trissin,1
Yep it's super hard to delete stuff,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Usually I dismantle everything below 55 stat points but every now and then I get like a 53 with only 2 points into strength so I keep it. I never spec into it but then I think strength might be good down the road so I keep pieces with high strength then my vault gets full and I need to delete stuff lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Is tough be a hoarder,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"^^^^
sometimes i feel uncomfortable even dismantling shaders because i feel like i might use it in the future and that would be inefficient",Trissin,1
Shaders I had to dismantle but itst a cost I'm willing to pay,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

holy cow that's incredible progress,RonInDune,1
yeah the time window to be considered multikill it's super tight for something like a GL,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
That took me an entire season and a half,RonInDune,1
"It’s still a good weapon too, I tried last word and sniper in crimson doubles and got smacked",Crizum,1
I spent the entirety of Season of the Drifter and much of Opulence working on that quest,RonInDune,1
but it was harder when you did it Ron,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Swapped to ultra crayon eater OEM/Recluse/MT/Suppressor to actually win,Crizum,1
it's still pretty dang hard lol,RonInDune,1
I really need to play with a team to win Crimson doubles,RonInDune,1
Getaway Artist is pretty clutch for it,Crizum,1
"I didnt play crimson at all, got the bow by doing pve bounties lol",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
true the only match I won was my teammate with getaway artist and me with constant healing nades,RonInDune,1

having a good twilight oath feels goooooooooooooooood,Jeremy,1
mmmmmmmmmmm,Jeremy,1
Had curated a week into Forsaken,Oathbreaker,1
same with fate cries foul,Jeremy,1
"i've had a curated twilight, just never used it",Jeremy,1
Also did you know thanks to the differences between console and pc,Crizum,1
i was always using fate cries or sole survivor,Jeremy,1
"Fate was my OG learning sniper, now the zoom feels horrible in comparison to most other things",Oathbreaker,1
The console is still in the dust rock/lunas meta,Crizum,1
i still use dust rock and NF,Jeremy,1
Does not surprise me honestly,Oathbreaker,1

WHOA,Trissin,1
They did it,Infernosi,1
"||**You’ll soon be able to change the Elemental Affinity on any piece of armor to either of the other two Affinity types directly from the item’s inspection screen by hovering your cursor over the armor's energy icon. This is intended to mitigate the experience of getting an armor drop with a stat roll you want, but the wrong Elemental Affinity. Changing an armor Affinity type will cost 1 Upgrade Module.**||",Trissin,1
Seasonal mod slots will also be universal,Infernosi,1
awesome,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I'll be able to delete so many pieces from the vault,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Big news,Crizum,1
no more triple exotics yay,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
lol,Trissin,1
Easier to have multiple sets geared towards different things,Crizum,1
I'm so happy that I'll play more crucible now,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
!lfg search,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
oh I though we had a sotp scheduled,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
wait they don't say whether we can slot in fallen/taken/hive armaments into the season agnostic slots,RonInDune,1
I've never used this season's charges with light stuff so no love lost there,RonInDune,1
im pretty sure I have the first two columns in my artifact unlocked,Trissin,1
and i have like 6 or 7 artifact points just chilling there,Trissin,1
"Oh, damn changing the affinity gets pricy.",Infernosi,1
It includes the cost of energy upgrades,Infernosi,1
"If its level 10, cost is everything needed to get it to level 10 and an upgrade module",Infernosi,1
"that might be too expensive, they'll probably tune it down later",RonInDune,1
"Maybe a little, but it does seem to be built towards one big final set",Infernosi,1
Although it isn't built towards changing it a lot I think,Infernosi,1
"this season mods are not great, like the damage one doesnt stack with anything besides weapon perks, so it's quite useless for end game content where you'll always have bubble/well for damage phases",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
and all the lose 1 charge with 1 kill... meh,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Combined with the one that gives you double charges seems like it works with masterwork weaponry,Infernosi,1
I saw someone on twitter say you can oneshot people with Le Monarque if you have the right mods,RonInDune,1
I,AhRealMonsters,1
"So I know the system can be powerful, but it's too obscure",RonInDune,1
Can testify,AhRealMonsters,1
as that has happened to me when @Kimarais/Nick and I were playing lol,AhRealMonsters,1
I also don't feel like I have a reason to invest into it,Infernosi,1
exactly,RonInDune,1
they're way too niche,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"there is one you get charged by breaking an elemental shield, great idea... then you go play hardest content in the game but cant find a bunch of shielded enemies",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
so the orbs is the most viable one but then again when you're getting a bunch of multikills are trash mobs so we dont need buff to kill them,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
the ideia is good but requires some rework,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
imo of course,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Oh okay, clarification from Cozmo on reddit",Crizum,1

anarchy....,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
okay so I don't mean to be rude or anything but,Trissin,1
no,RonInDune,1
I feel like complaining about not getting the rare drop in only 6 clears is not quite justifiable,Trissin,1
no,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yes!!,RonInDune,1
"speaking of which, when are we doing this weeks futile 3x run",RonInDune,1
the fallen require more sacrifice,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

Saturday night or sunday works for me,Kimarais/Nick,1
Really wanna spread the depression evenly through the weekend,Kimarais/Nick,1
@RonInDune I think you have more clears of SOTP than I do now lol,Trissin,1
😦,RonInDune,1
"actually wait, i guess you've been doing x3 runs",Trissin,1
"I'm down, guaranteed anarchy after all momentum control",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I think I'm at 38 runs now. not that i care about it. it might be good for me to be in the run bc I'll never get it hahaha.,thegoaliebear,1
goal weren't you also around 38 for 1k?,Trissin,1
yes,thegoaliebear,1
maybe this will be the one,Trissin,1
what else are you missing for blacksmith?,Trissin,1
but I also got 1kv with an lfg group so that was the game's way of telling me to ditch the ps4 group.,thegoaliebear,1
I'm missing a lot for blacksmith but i literally don't give a single shit about it.,thegoaliebear,1
oh lol,Trissin,1
like most of the forge stuff. never bothered with izanagis either. still don't care.,thegoaliebear,1
"maybe i'll go for blacksmith one day. just need the sotp sparrow, and then i'll actually grind out the rare bounties",Trissin,1
yeah i don't have the time for that nor do i want to have the time for it bc i would just never do it lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
i got better things to do than concern myself with old irrelevant content to me.,thegoaliebear,1
"there is some sort of joke to be made here with the sparrow being named ""always on time"" but I can't find it",Trissin,1
I think last run was only the second time I actually completed the full sparrow section,RonInDune,1
"Actually that reminds me, if Ron's internet is better then perhaps we should get him his enlightened title",Trissin,1
i've also ran 6 sotp's,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
oh,Trissin,1
sorry i should've specified lol that was your raid report iwant,Trissin,1
that wasn't my profile,Trissin,1
oh,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
XD,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
okay I can see how that was misinterpreted,Trissin,1
ill find mine,Trissin,1
"probably not this week, by internet has been having issues",RonInDune,1
but soon-ish,RonInDune,1
I am fine to do scourge because it's fairly low risk,RonInDune,1
it is in my opinion the easiest raid,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"then again, my job is usually map or add clear",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
yea it's either this or eater,RonInDune,1
https://raid.report/pc/4611686018475931494,RonInDune,1
"yeah, maybe. You guys remember that strike from D1? ""Crota's End"" or something?",Trissin,1
That was a cool strike,Trissin,1
lool,RonInDune,1
I saw Gladd solo Crota using drumsticks,RonInDune,1
"blindfolded, drumsticks, voice commands, you name it",Trissin,1
idk what's sadder in that statement. the fact that he actually thought of trying that or the fact that he had the time to dedicate to that.,thegoaliebear,1
gotta rake in those views one way or another,Trissin,1
Are you a true Destiny veteran if you haven't soloed a raid with a DDR dance pad?,Peronix,1
Isn't gladd the biggest channel on twitch right now,RonInDune,1
dude's probably making big bucks,RonInDune,1
biggest channel on twitch? no way,Trissin,1
not my favourite kind of streamer though I can appareciate what he does,RonInDune,1
is he actually?,Trissin,1
The Corridors of Time stuff boosted him big time,Peronix,1
"damn, that's actually crazy though",Trissin,1
no he's not lmao.,thegoaliebear,1
"He is consistent, but not giant",Kimarais/Nick,1
"He was at one point, I know that",Peronix,1
https://twitter.com/GladdOnTwitch/status/1225050614008143872,RonInDune,1
I think he's since surpassed GDQ as well,RonInDune,1
that's unfortunate.,thegoaliebear,1
i never liked him nor the clan he's in tbh.,thegoaliebear,1
"redeem, right?",RonInDune,1
"no? I'm not a huge fan of redeem, but follow ehroar pretty religiously",Trissin,1
for Destiny I mostly only watch Teawrex and datto tbh,RonInDune,1
never followed his channel. never watched his streams. doesn't give good vibes.,thegoaliebear,1
But who else will give use the gfuel to go with peronix's gamer goo?,Kimarais/Nick,1
I like to mix them together,Peronix,1
That's optimal,Kimarais/Nick,1
this is so cursed,Trissin,1
"It's the equivalent of steroids, but *gamer* steroids",Peronix,1
I'm pretty sure summit is the most subbed channel now.,thegoaliebear,1
"ah that makes sense, no way gladd's keeping those numbers",RonInDune,1
I'm gonna wait until Goalie's challenging the big ones,RonInDune,1
"yeah, it's hard to see him passing a lot of the really big names",Trissin,1
nope lmao. he only gets more when there's an event/new raid or something.,thegoaliebear,1
I think consistent viewership is a better indicator than subs,Kimarais/Nick,1
and then people remember there are actually entertaining streamers on twitch.,thegoaliebear,1
Especially with prime subs being a thing,Kimarais/Nick,1
"I think summit and doc are the most consistent with always have like, over 10k. at least from the streamers I follow.",thegoaliebear,1
yup yup,RonInDune,1
the only D2 streamer I follow is EK.,thegoaliebear,1
To give you an idea of gladd vs other channels I follow,Kimarais/Nick,1
Is actually pretty low outside of new hot content,Kimarais/Nick,1
I wouldn't call 2.1k low,Peronix,1
"It isnt low, but it's not as high as you would expect with that many subs",Kimarais/Nick,1
Although twitch viewership feels like it's not a crazy as it was like 2-3 years ago,Kimarais/Nick,1
It's all about Facebook Live,Peronix,1
The true future of streamed content,Kimarais/Nick,1
I can watch da games and see aunt debra yell about the deep state all in one convenient place,Kimarais/Nick,1
Quality,Kimarais/Nick,1
"On one monitor, I have xQc. The other, a top 10 list as to how Trump has saved the economy. Yep, I'm a Facebook *gamer*",Peronix,1

Also eventually Gladd will be number 1 if only because mixer will have poached everyone else,Crizum,1
"Wait, will the seasonal mod changes remove the forsaken and other year 2 mods?",Infernosi,1
dont touch my hive mods damn,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"It won’t remove, but I think what they’re going for is season of dawn armor will use undying, dawn, and next season",Crizum,1
"Hive mods can go on opulence gear currently correct? If the changes are retroactive it should mean you can use opulence mods on drifter, opulence, and undying/shadow keep I think",Crizum,1

"i need more stacks in the other team, makes life so much easier",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Didn't they say that it was retroactive to all armor?,Infernosi,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
Drifter armor is probably worth grabbing now,Crizum,1
Since it can use fallen and hive,Crizum,1
ooooh,RonInDune,1
"Keep a set of drifter, a set of forsaken, a set of dawn, and you’re good until the season after next",Crizum,1

Why was stuff like Gjallarhorn so dominant in D1 but rocket launchers as a whole so underused in D2 anyway?,RonInDune,1
ugh yeah. I miss using RLs.,thegoaliebear,1
"D2 rockets are weak because of Gjallarhorn for the most part, and they hit them harder because of auto-reloads",Crizum,1
yeah auto reload hit GL and RL super hard,RonInDune,1
"But even without those, surely they can be of more use",RonInDune,1
"GL is still good though, but I felt at launch they were kinda weak",Crizum,1
Did D1 have auto reload?,RonInDune,1
from anything I mean,RonInDune,1
I think what happened is power creep,Crizum,1
Seems like Cozmo is monitoring that discussion as well,Trissin,1
yea that's good that Bungo is aware,RonInDune,1
Everything else got slowly more powerful and Bungie has gjallarptsd,Crizum,1
lol,RonInDune,1
i don't think there was any autoreloading in d1,Trissin,1
"other than black spindle, best we had was triple tap and triple double",Trissin,1
Did Gjallarhorn have more than one shot in the tube at a time?,RonInDune,1
i think? i might be forgetting,Trissin,1
I don't think so with exception of maybe some very niche exotics,Oathbreaker,1
interesting,RonInDune,1
Gjallarhorn had 2 shots IIRC,Oathbreaker,1
^,Trissin,1
ah,RonInDune,1
Maybe a blanket 25% buff in damage for rockets would be good,RonInDune,1
Something like how they fixed Xenophage,RonInDune,1
Do all rockets in D2 have only one shot?,Crizum,1
D1 you could have 2-3 correct?,Crizum,1
I think Truth has more?,RonInDune,1
pretty sure in d1 you could have tripod **and** clown cartridge,Trissin,1
so up to 5 lol,Trissin,1
gat dang,RonInDune,1
see that would instantly change the boss meta back,RonInDune,1
"Bad Juju and some weapon exotics had perks that reloaded them automatically or would allow for shots to return to the magazine for free.The First Curse (intended to be the opposite of TLW, so a slow firing hard hitting HC) would reload upon first precision kill of the magazine. Pretty sure old Sealed Ahamkara Grasps would do some auto reloading shit too on Hunters",Oathbreaker,1
"I think that was a single rocket that could roll tripod plus CC, and I think CC was a chance to roll more in the mag",Oathbreaker,1
Was there a Huckleberry equivalent?,RonInDune,1
Most common was 4 in the mag with some magazine shenanigans,Oathbreaker,1
oh btw Oath I hope your test went well!,RonInDune,1
"No, not really. Ace of Spades would load a new bullet into the mag for every precision shot",Oathbreaker,1
"oh that's a great Ace perk, wish we had that now",RonInDune,1
"Yeah, about that...... I think I passed but I butchered things badly",Oathbreaker,1
"^
i felt that",Trissin,1
"eh it's all good, Dynamics is a tough subject!",RonInDune,1
You'll get 'em next time,RonInDune,1
Fucking instantaneous centre of motion,Oathbreaker,1
that's all I'm gonna say,Oathbreaker,1
Oh! almost forgot,Oathbreaker,1
All of the King's Fall raid weapons had an auto-loading perk,Oathbreaker,1
"It was called Cocoon, and I think it was D1's version of Auto Loading Holster",Oathbreaker,1
"and yeah it looks like you could roll CC and tripod on a single rocket, the issue I think was it capped it out to 4 rockets (very well may have been 5)",Oathbreaker,1
"Touch of Malice would be devastating in the current sandbox, and actually less so when we had auto-reloading haha",Crizum,1
plus it's such a cool looking gun too,RonInDune,1
ToM is nutty,Oathbreaker,1
"lol considering tuesday I get 120 glory, I actually need 1980 for MT https://prnt.sc/r2h5v3",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

https://prnt.sc/r2j1ao,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"you know what, I might be able to join for CoS or something tonight. Last time @Thawxtem asked me, I thought I'd have a lot of stuff I need to do but actually I might be free tonight",Trissin,1
"we still have the semi final boss save, we should try get it done before reset",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
so I'm down to Sherpa CoS if necessary,Trissin,1
that fire team was BADDD,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
and hmmmmm,Trissin,1
if you guys needed someone else I'm sure Trissin and I could step in for some shenanigans,Oathbreaker,1
Maybe I'll try pick up the boss CP for crown,Trissin,1
"we cant blame the guy that much tbh, I feel bad for him",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
we could try something interesting @Oathbreaker,Trissin,1
we could indeed,Oathbreaker,1
I do not know the strat for Galhran 2 man so,Oathbreaker,1
oh neither do I lol,Trissin,1
but to be honest I don't think it's too hard,Trissin,1
probably not,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I think boss damage is gonna be the hardest part,Trissin,1
especially as we'll be lacking debuffs,Trissin,1
yeah that's the real big thing,Oathbreaker,1
plus no auto reload,Oathbreaker,1
^,Trissin,1
"hive armaments mods for the win, a bunch of thralls during damage phase so almost infinite heavy",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
but you gotta have blessing for that,Trissin,1
what's the hive armaments mod /s,Oathbreaker,1
so only one of us can have that,Trissin,1
"true, other maybe tractor and izanagis?",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

then you get the debuff and special ammo is easy to get,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"no, I don't think tractor/div is worth in a team fewer than 4 people",Trissin,1
double Izi maybe?,Oathbreaker,1
I was thinking about that too,Trissin,1
but idk if it's enough total damage,Trissin,1
bubble and tether can be a bit tricky but maybe,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

"Quick question about something I noticed with Izanagi's: Sometimes when I hold reload after firing, it reloads and then reloads again to Honed Edge. Other times I hold reload after firing and it goes straight to 4x Honed Edge. Is there something I'm missing?",Thawxtem,1
Timing and practice,Crizum,1
Happens inside and out of wells,Thawxtem,1
If you don't hold reload quick enough it does that,Crizum,1
Could I hold reload while firing?,Thawxtem,1
as soon as i pull the trigger i'm already press reload,LW Mugetsu,1
increase reload speed mods or luna well make the window to press reload shorter. but its all about timing and practice. a tip is fire and without release RMB you press R,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"""without release RMB?""",Thawxtem,1
"yeah, like you're scoped in when you shoot right? keep mouse right button pressed and imediately press reload",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
ah. wasn't sure what RMB stood for,Thawxtem,1
"yea the quick reload timing can be a bit hard to get it down, I practiced quite a bit in the tribute hall to get it down",RonInDune,1
it's handy to get one extra shot during the GoS boss damage phase for instance,RonInDune,1
I feel like I could do more damage in most of the boss fights if I could get the timing down better. Everyone else typically gets 1-2 more shots in than me,Thawxtem,1
"yeah, do what I did and practice for a bit on the ogre in the tributehall, or on Greg",RonInDune,1
Greg? Another Randall or something?,Thawxtem,1
Greg the ogre is the lost sector boss on Titan,RonInDune,1

I don’t recommend izanagi for CoS. Actually Thawx if you have Loaded Question a decent loadout is Outbreak/Loaded Question/Spike Grenades,Crizum,1
Or MT/Recluse/Grenades,Crizum,1
It was just a question about Izanagi in general,Thawxtem,1
Gotcha,Crizum,1
you can't one phase Gahlran with Outbreak though,RonInDune,1
But Thawx is a CoS veteran,RonInDune,1
what if we all run outbreak?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Among the first in the world,RonInDune,1
Most of the time I had Jottun for the wizards,Thawxtem,1
All outbreaks actually wrecked but they nerfed auto-reload so not anymore,Crizum,1
auto reload?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
like store away and bam nsta reload?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

there's WAY more,Thawxtem,1
jesus,RonInDune,1
not as bad as final fantasy,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I just scrolled past all that lol,RonInDune,1
Hey I liked FF Spirits Within,RonInDune,1
FF isn’t as bad,Crizum,1
Though I'm told that's not in any of the games,RonInDune,1
FF caused so many branching off games it was insane,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
like yall ever hear of Swords and mana,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
or any of the Mana franchise?,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
thats a series that branches off of FF 1 for the NES,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Yeah but at least those are all mostly stand alone and not the same storyline,Crizum,1
Which is the best one?,RonInDune,1
none of the FF franchise has a storyline!!,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
FF I mean,RonInDune,1
7,Thawxtem,1
XIV,Crizum,1
1,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
lol,RonInDune,1
1 and 2,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
7 is the one with the remake right?,RonInDune,1
Yeah,Crizum,1
the latest,Thawxtem,1
More than one have had a remake,Thawxtem,1

dang that's too bad,RonInDune,1
it was good off of release,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
but they ruined it with the battle royale,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I remember seeing the trailer and thought it looked cool lol,RonInDune,1
"i mean don't get me wrong, the graphics are surreal",Saint 14's loyal follower,1
wait there's a battlefield battle royale,RonInDune,1
damn,RonInDune,1
Still waiting on Ubisoft to give us an open world asscreed battle royale,Crizum,1
but the playerbase is kind of people who would jump around with shot guns and sniper rifles,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Because they haven’t killed AC enough,Crizum,1
AC doesnt deserve a battle royale,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
it deserves more then that,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"any game that stoops to that low, is off their rocker",Saint 14's loyal follower,1

"Okay, where does the Titans and Crayola come from, anyway?",Thawxtem,1

cayde was just foolish,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
and dont talk crap about my cayde.....,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I mean I liked Cayde but honestly dude was dumb as fuck,Crizum,1
he was a comedian,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
what do you expect,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
they should make it so cabal can be picked as guardians,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
i would play as a space rhino any day,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Also,Crizum,1
I don’t think anyone actually likes warlocks in canon,Crizum,1

Yes but,Crizum,1
Saint says nice things to me,Crizum,1
so does ikora,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
and cayde,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
and osiris,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

Lol,Crizum,1
Naw I like hunters too,Crizum,1
but you dont like cayde.....,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
I actually identify as a contrarian asshole,Crizum,1
that makes sense,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
"No I love Cayde he’s just dumb, and I love him for it",Crizum,1
I only really dislike Osiris and even that’s minor,Crizum,1

Final encounter,Thawxtem,1
nice!!,RonInDune,1
30th try,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
and we didnt defeat it,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
51 tries I would say,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
you can get it next time!,RonInDune,1
Got close,Crizum,1
!lfg create,Crizum,1

that's and uh-oh moment,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
Finally got Graviton Lance catalyst,RonInDune,1
Nice,LW Mugetsu,1
"Nice, gl to get all the passive kills",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
It needs 1k cosmology kills if I remember properly,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Oh god, @Crizum I found the source for that Bugs Bunny Byte",Peronix,1
That is a terrifying statement out of context,RonInDune,1
It’s so terrifying,Peronix,1
*The whole YouTube channel*,Peronix,1
"So I went on a 6 game winstreak in comp last night, and I feel like 100 recovery is way better than 100 resilience or 100 discipline",RonInDune,1
You can clearly tell how much faster the regen is,RonInDune,1
recov > damn near everything else,Oathbreaker,1
Trust me,Oathbreaker,1
yup I'm finding that out now,RonInDune,1
100 Res does basically nothing for TTK,Oathbreaker,1
"100 mobility, wormhusk and void battery  = profit",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
also feels like devour is not as handy in PvP as it is in PvE,RonInDune,1
Devour most definitely isn't unless you can confidently out duel opponents one after another,Oathbreaker,1
"if you can't, then the other two trees are far better",Oathbreaker,1
yeah that's the hard part,RonInDune,1
It can be absolutely monstrous though when set up for the chain,Oathbreaker,1
what's a good gun to outduel last word or lunas in the mid range?,RonInDune,1
Last word or Lunas,Oathbreaker,1
I'm wondering if I should use a solar smg,RonInDune,1
basically,Oathbreaker,1
oh damn lol,RonInDune,1
SMGs don't have a competitive TTK except for when you hit all headshots,Oathbreaker,1
that's kinda hard,RonInDune,1
autos?,RonInDune,1
don't bother with autos lol,Oathbreaker,1
😦,RonInDune,1
only two semi competitive ones are suros when fully spun up or monte with x5 perk,Oathbreaker,1
I liked Suros cause I just finished with the catalyst but I'm worried comp will not be nice to me,RonInDune,1
Pulses or Hand Cannons are kinda the way right now primary wise,Oathbreaker,1
scouts are finnicky but doable,Oathbreaker,1
any sidearms that match up?,RonInDune,1
I mean,Oathbreaker,1
I'm going revoker or randy's in primary,RonInDune,1
Sidearms are kinda ass compared to hand cannons,Oathbreaker,1
sure more damage but so much closer in terms of range,Oathbreaker,1
😢,RonInDune,1
You *can* make them work,Oathbreaker,1
the issue is when you try to duel a HC it won't have the same range,Oathbreaker,1
"I've been trying to headshot supers with revoker, I think it should one shot",RonInDune,1
still haven't gotten one,RonInDune,1
"Hc are pretty op if you think they're kinda a revolver, their range should be shorter imo. But if you change them there is no other option for pvp",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"also, ancient gospel with rapid hit slaps pretty hard",RonInDune,1
90rpms one shot supers now so yeah Revoker one shots to the head,Oathbreaker,1
If they nerf HC range even more then I'm done basically lol,Oathbreaker,1
Is the Sturm drang combo any good? I'm wondering the overcharged sturm shot can two tap,RonInDune,1
it can,Oathbreaker,1
Plus it has good range,RonInDune,1
hmm,RonInDune,1
with one kill on Drang I think,Oathbreaker,1
It has okay range. It should hit cap?,Oathbreaker,1
But it fires slowly af,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
it's the drang kill that's hard,RonInDune,1
true true,RonInDune,1
The issue is without the Drang bullet you have a mediocre at best 110,Oathbreaker,1
"Basically you want a 150, 140 if you really land your shots",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
You want to use something fun yet stupid? 110 HC with Eriana's Vow and Lucky Pants,Oathbreaker,1
lol,RonInDune,1
so just keep switching back and forth,RonInDune,1
If you get the fast swap down it's actually a stupid TTK,Oathbreaker,1
But yeah right now,Oathbreaker,1
it's 150 or nothing in HC territory,Oathbreaker,1
I mean you're good enought to pull that off but I don't think I am,RonInDune,1
Arguments could be made for certain rolls on other archetypes but 150s are the most forgiving,Oathbreaker,1
"also it's funny, my matches after getting to comp fabled have been less sweaty than regular crucible",RonInDune,1
"I'm pretty low, around 2400 but my matches are more even now and not full of mindbenders spare rations",RonInDune,1
they will be,Oathbreaker,1
eventually,Oathbreaker,1
😢,RonInDune,1
sadly that's what's the most competitive these days for solo players,Oathbreaker,1
"I only kinda like momentum control, super fast ttk",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Momentum Control could have been so good,Oathbreaker,1
"yup, momentum control actually made me a better player",RonInDune,1
Like that Halo Reach sniper only gamemode,RonInDune,1
but then they included heavy and allowed stupid things to 1hko,Oathbreaker,1
"Jade rabbit, *shakes fists*",RonInDune,1
Yeah don't mind me just gonna sit in the back of the map and somehow farm out a Seventh Column,Oathbreaker,1
"lol, I have to get that catalyst down so might as well do it",RonInDune,1
they should do a sniper only mode,RonInDune,1
I've to get several crucible only catalysts,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
though it was easier in reach because there was only one sniper I suppose,RonInDune,1
Jade Rabbit/Vigilance WIng/ Suros,RonInDune,1
these are the easier ones,RonInDune,1
I have MIDA to finish,Oathbreaker,1
There's also MIDA but that's only for the best players,RonInDune,1
Exactly lol,RonInDune,1
Yeah I won't ever get to legend,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Oath is the only person I know who's on Legend,RonInDune,1
Yeah lemme go get 200 kills on Mida for ***OUTLAW***,Oathbreaker,1
Rover too,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
best perk in the game,RonInDune,1
oh I didn't know that,RonInDune,1
nice,RonInDune,1
On a gun that already has ***max reload***,Oathbreaker,1
¯\_(ツ)_/¯,Oathbreaker,1
Someone was lazy at Bungie HQ,Oathbreaker,1
they should give MIDA swashbuckler or master of arms,RonInDune,1
or maybe feeding frenzy,RonInDune,1
wait no that's useless,RonInDune,1
Master of arms would make it so strong,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
now that it procs on headshots only it's more balanced,RonInDune,1
MIDA won't get a rework honestly,Oathbreaker,1
yea probably,RonInDune,1
there's too many guns now,RonInDune,1
We've a ton of weapons but honestly like 10 of them are solid options,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Most are just meme or bad weapons,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
especially in the case of Crucible,Oathbreaker,1
give new guns better perk pools,Oathbreaker,1
"because right now, most guns have shit perk pools and bad stats",Oathbreaker,1
"For pve too, they work on the easiest things but well anything work for those activities",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
so why the fuck would I use them,Oathbreaker,1
Yep,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
sturm and drang in any gamemode claps,Saint 14's loyal follower,1

I'm over 30 in Scourge so,RonInDune,1
honestly I guess 20 isn't really that bad. There are others out there who have it a lot worse than I do,Trissin,1
I'll get anarchy after the reset,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Lol,Crizum,1
I need to just grind out this stupid raid until I get it,Crizum,1
There was recent post on twitter of a guy getting Anarchy in his 107th run or something like that,RonInDune,1

that's actually disgusting,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
why does it look like ikora,Saint 14's loyal follower,1
What do you mean? It's the new Warlock character,Peronix,1
alright I'm going to try to get 200 jade rabbit kills in momentum control before reset,RonInDune,1
should be easy,RonInDune,1
"That's risky, bungo might break the game again and rollback it",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
eh there's no way it happens again,RonInDune,1
what can possibly go wrong?,RonInDune,1
Thought the exactly same thing last reset lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yeah but lighting never strikes the same spot thrice,RonInDune,1
unless you're Thor I suppose,RonInDune,1
"But you might be right, there is no patch today",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Oof, if Bungie did have to rollback, Ron would be pretty *Jaded*",Peronix,1
"Better safe than sorry, I just gonna troll destiny sub for the next hour and a half",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"If you want to see a real salt mine, check out the r/Wolcen subreddit",Peronix,1
"One rough launch, next thing you know, there's a post claiming that the developers have breached ethics",Peronix,1
I couldn't play for more than 15 minutes but Wolcen sure did look pretty,RonInDune,1
I'll start playing once it's working again,RonInDune,1
I'll check out,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"I've been playing offline, but I think  Online is fixed",Peronix,1
oh I should give it a go then,RonInDune,1
"Can't wait for trials, sub will be so fun",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I created my character and played like 15 minutes,RonInDune,1
I might finally have to git gud if trials comes back,RonInDune,1
I can imagine Oath as a dril instructor yelling at us to train,RonInDune,1
"What if, and I might be crazy for saying this, Trials uses the same rules as Momentum Control",Peronix,1
I guess they will add a really good ritual weapon to make us play trials,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Also peronix do the character models look a bit off to you in Wolcen? Like all the women's legs are like 90% of their body,RonInDune,1
"Oh yeah, the women are all leg in Wolcen",Peronix,1
"That wouldn't be too bad, I like how momentum control forces you to not rely on any crutches",RonInDune,1
"It makes sense from an isometric point of view, I guess, but it looks so wrong when viewed at any other angle",Peronix,1
I guess the devs like long legs,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Look at those *legs*,Peronix,1
I saw that thumbs up trissin 😉,RonInDune,1
Cant stop staring at the very short torso tho,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
That's why it looks so wrong,Peronix,1
Also they all wear like 8 inch stilleto heels which must be very uncomfortable to trek in craggy mountains with,RonInDune,1
It's a shame because the game looks so bloody good,RonInDune,1
Much better than PoE or even Diablo,RonInDune,1
"I like it a lot, though it does have its own share of problems (female models, bugs, progression loss, additive skills).",Peronix,1
"Nothing that can't be fixed, though",Peronix,1
progression loss??,RonInDune,1
"If you were to visit the subreddit, however, you'd think the devs are the worst devs in the world",Peronix,1
that's pretty bad,RonInDune,1
aw,RonInDune,1
"I've never heard of the studio before, are they AAA?",RonInDune,1
"There was a server issue that caused people to lose campaign progression. Fixed now, though, and those people got their progress back",Peronix,1
Then what is there to complain about?,Trissin,1
"No, they're an indie studio with, like, 50 people",Peronix,1
daaaaaang,RonInDune,1
that does not look like an indie game,RonInDune,1
"For progression loss, nothing to complain about anymore, fortunately",Peronix,1
"The development timeline is pretty interesting to read about. Apparently, it started as a completely different game on Kickstarter. A couple years later, the devs decided to scratch everything and make Wolcen. Then spent the next few years developing it.",Peronix,1
huh,RonInDune,1
"It's filled with bugs, typos, and vice versa, but my guess is that they ran out of Kickstarter funds and needed the launch cash",Peronix,1
"there's a good game there, so I'm sure they can pull it off",RonInDune,1
"On another note, have y’all seen the new remake of Ed Edd n Eddy?",Peronix,1
Nope,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

That works then we go for anarchy later in the week,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
yea Anarchy tomorrow maybe?,RonInDune,1
Im down,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
@Destiny [PC] ^crown run lfg for those interested,Crizum,1
I'll join tomorrow for scourge runs lol.,thegoaliebear,1
Lol,Crizum,1
Got the boss down pretty good now honestly,Crizum,1
We need to know when Mugetsu can run scourge for the sparrow part lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
I just hate that raid😂,thegoaliebear,1
tfw 3am :feelsbad:,sasch,1
The really sad thing about sotp is I got anarchy before I got a decent threat level,LW Mugetsu,1
too many bad times with CoS. ruined it for me unfortunately. but I like scourge.,thegoaliebear,1
"Scourge first encounter makes my life miserable it always berserker at 2, deposit at 4 fml",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

And Ron always get map,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Lol,LW Mugetsu,1

Ayyyy hahaha I think every time I've done scourge with Ron he's been our guide on map!,Trissin,1
And he's good at it!!,Trissin,1
Sar gonna be running that 100 mobi pvp loadout for orbs,Kimarais/Nick,1
"It's every orb, so annoying",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Warlock glide that shit,Crizum,1
As hunter I cant even skate with the orb,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"Maybe I'll join for sotp some time, if you guys want to speed things up you should try learning how to dupe the orbs",Trissin,1
Ron's team 1 first pick up,LW Mugetsu,1
There's a small learning curve but it literally cuts encounter times in half,Trissin,1
How is it done?,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
You need to die right before you trigger the animation where you slam the orb into the socket,Trissin,1
"You hold deposit, and right when the ring is full you need to die",Trissin,1
"Kind of like how you launch raid banners super high in the air, but with depositing orbs instead",Trissin,1
I like how they tried to fix PoH dupe and made it in a way that you can't screw up anymore,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Like they made it easier? How?,Crizum,1
wait how'd they manage that?,Oathbreaker,1
If you screw up it doesn't deposit so you don't lose the orb lol,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
Oh shit haha,Crizum,1
"lol I think I tried poh dupe once, when I was trying to solo flawless but i honestly felt it made the totem encounter much harder",Trissin,1
yeah the PoH dupe is so much easier now,RonInDune,1
I noticed it deposits super fast since last I did it,Crizum,1
||That new cutscene though ||,Peronix,1
"before the patch we start to dunk and swap weapons, so any mistake the orb was dunked",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1
"now it dunks super fast, so you swap weapons and instantly dunk if you screw up you just drop the orb",Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

Oh probably,Oathbreaker,1
but the step up just doesn't correlate with the previous stages,Oathbreaker,1
yeah,Trissin,1
They were 1 billion increments unless I'm wrong,Oathbreaker,1
At first I thought it launched on 9/7. But it was 9/9 when destiny launched. So that is out. 😭,AhRealMonsters,1
Not much more than previous increment. It went from 3 to 6 billions,Sarsante - 76561197967628966,1

Best boi,Peronix,1
❤️ Matthew Mercer,Crizum,1
a minor thing triggering people is pretty common these days lol.,thegoaliebear,1

https://youtube.com/watch?v=3AE1GXzSPhM @thegoaliebear one of the scenes in question,Crizum,1
"so...what exactly were people upset with there? like, i read into that more as harassment than anything.",thegoaliebear,1
I believe it’s because the only gay characters in the game are perceived as sexual harassers,Peronix,1
huh that's actually a legit point,RonInDune,1
wait do people want that harassment back in?,RonInDune,1
Gamers™️ do. They claim the altering of said scene is C E N S O R S H I P,Peronix,1
that's .... dumb,RonInDune,1
The game does also have a drag queen in it,Crizum,1
"i mean, i can see why people would be upset that the only gay characters were portrayed that way. if there are other characters who act like that, then it would be okay i think. but if those are the only characters who are involved in it then yeah i see how that could be problematic.",thegoaliebear,1

But I can concede that I’m a white guy so I’m not dealing with “still? In 2020? Fuck off” like others are,Crizum,1
We live in a society. Gamers are oppressed. We must rise up,Peronix,1

What weapons are left that never got anti-barrier/overload/etc. mods? Heavies?,RonInDune,1
"Just heavies I think? They’ll probably redistribute so you’ll see weapons that previously had anti-barrier now be overcharge etc etc. Also, yeah that all seems fair I’ll dial the bs way back sorry y’all",Crizum,1
I'm surprised they've haven't done unstoppable on heavys yet,Arixama,1
It definitely would make sense,Arixama,1
I don't think they want to have people run out of heavy ammo while using an unstoppable mod,Oathbreaker,1
^^,Crizum,1
"in some activities like ones with rally banners, sure, it's fine, but in ones like the 980NF you're risking having no ammo",Oathbreaker,1
Plus aside from Izanagi most people use exotics in the heavy slot and exotics can’t have those mods unless it’s intrinsic,Crizum,1
I think unstoppable makes a lot of sense on like lmgs,Arixama,1
I mean sure but again,Oathbreaker,1
you're gambling with the heavy ammo economy,Oathbreaker,1
Bungo doesn't like that and rightfully so,Oathbreaker,1
"It does, maybe they’ll throw it as just a perk of the weapon type? Like machine guns get stagger, linear fusion get anti-barrier and the like?",Crizum,1
Would open up the mod system for primary and energy weapons a bit,Crizum,1
"imagine you have an unstoppable Ogre running at you in 980 Savathun's, and you just burned the last of your ammo on boss DPS trying to burn the boss down real fucking quick, and you get wiped by that Ogre",Oathbreaker,1
how angry would you be,Oathbreaker,1
That would be great but would like require a massive rework in how the weapon systems work if that makes sense,Oathbreaker,1
"Yeah, it does. They have shown they aren’t against entire system changes though, but I bet they are wary after Season of Bugs",Crizum,1
Lot of backend data that would need to be changed for every single weapon for every class that gets an intrinsic perk like that.,Oathbreaker,1
"It could be done, but that opens them up to a metric fuckton of bugs",Oathbreaker,1
Feels like it wouldn’t be too different from mods though? Just a mod that we don’t see and can’t place,Crizum,1
"Heavy only weapons are like, non-breach GL, machine guns, linear fusion rifles (not counting Arbalest) and swords right?",Crizum,1
"See that's one way to make rocket launchers good again, make them have some intrinsic perk",RonInDune,1
Oh yeah those are things. Yeah but I kinda don’t want them to have a forced niche you know?,Crizum,1
"“This is useful because we said so, not because it’s competitive”",Crizum,1
tru tru,RonInDune,1
"Yeah, but most weapons have a built in archetype specific intrinsic perk. For example, 150 Hand Cannons give a mobility buff when equipped (Excluding Luna's and Not Forgotten) due to the Lightweight frame. This is true for all Lightweight frames",Oathbreaker,1
So Bungie would have to find a way to make the new intrinsic weapon class perk and old intrinsic archetype class perk play nice together in the developer sandbox,Oathbreaker,1
"not impossible, but it's not just a simple ""add it on and ship it to live servers"" addition",Oathbreaker,1
yeah that's why having traction + lightweight frames can basically boost you beyond  100 mobility,RonInDune,1
