thegoaliebear [SEP] I'm not going to be online tonight, but I will be watching the stream tonight. I'll also be checking on the PC gaming scene for the first time. So I'll definitely be updating my twitter and facebook for those who want to get an idea of what's going on. I'll also be updating the Steam community page for the game, and I'll also be playing around with the Steam Community Vault.  I'll also be in the Steam forum for the game, and I'll be on Steam's steamcommunity.com/thegoaliebear for the game's community thread.
<|startoftext|>Crizum [SEP] The community is absolutely vital

thegoaliebear [SEP] @here i am using the same exact character in a different game. i am using a character from my profile and my friends. it's not even that bad haha. just that i have to do the level up and level up again. but since i have to do the level up and level up again, and it's not even that bad, i feel like it's a lot of fun.
