# Building a GPT-2 bot based on Discord Chat Messages

Start of a process to fine-tune GPT-2 using my Destiny 2 discord clan chat messages for generating realistic replies.

Done on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pQ44YlhfWLy7YO0wjgHsq2dXzFS55dAr?usp=sharing)

Includes a [checkpoint](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-2fyKsC3xn2bMPhd0TYlVmDJ_iP4slCG/view?usp=sharing) to run GPT-2 locally if needed.

### processing training data
Discord bot finetune gpt.ipynb is used to process the data to generate the dataset for fine tuning, including separators and removing bot messages.

### pulling discord chat
I used [Discord CHat Exporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki) to pull a complete chat history from the PC-LFG channel. 

### Output

Sample outputs can be found in gpt2_gentext_20200306_004228.txt


### Building the bot
Will be posted soon.
